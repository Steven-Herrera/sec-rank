Importantly, the SECs proposed rule makes a difference between incidents that have been stopped or fixed and those that have not yet been mitigated. The proposed rule would require publicly traded companies to report cybersecurity incidents on public forms within four days of deciding that the incident is important. When the information is out in the open, both attackers and investors can use it and if an uncontrolled or unmitigated cyber incident gets out to the public, attackers are likely to do things that hurt investors even more through further exploitation.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The American Chemistry Council (ACC) submits these additional comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to the proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. Ive attached ACCs comments submitted on May 9, 2022 in support of this letter.  To reiterate, ACC believes the SECs 2018 guidance to publicly traded companies is sufficient in providing information on cybersecurity reporting obligations and provides information that informs investors. As proposed, SECs cyber incident disclosure revisions could expose a companys security resilience procedures to cyber hackers. Materiality determinations are emphasized over cybersecurity risks. SECs proposal would shift the focus to compliance based reporting rather than the more appropriate focus on managing cyber risks and identifying and resolving cyber incidents.  The SEC proposal was drafted without the consideration of the cyber incident reporting requirements of other federal agencies and the newly enacted cyber incident reporting legislation. ACC members are subject to cyber related rules required by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, the Transportation Security Agency, the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others, depending on the companys scope of activities. Rather than creating additional and potentially conflicting cyber incident reporting requirements, the SEC should coordinate with other federal agencies to harmonize reporting requirements.  Subject to the CISA rulemaking, the new cyber incident reporting legislation (CIRCIA) requires certain owners and/or operators of critical infrastructure to report covered cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours. CIRCIAs 72 hour window compares roughly equally to the Commissions proposed Form 8 K requirement, which stipulates that a company must disclose a material cybersecurity incident to the SEC within 4 business days. However, the SEC americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000    does not allow for temporary delays in reporting that may be due to internal investigation of the incident or external investigation, including efforts by law enforcement. Companies should not be required to report if it may compromise an ongoing investigation. The SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement to mitigate cyber incidents, rather than disclose potentially inaccurate information within 4 business days. Although a company may be able to make a materiality determination and subsequently disclose within four business days, in many cases it will not have the information necessary to make a meaningful disclosure within that time period. Cybersecurity incidents can take many months to investigate, with forensic analysis producing new information that likely alters factors relevant to the incidents technical and cybersecurity significance and broader business impact.  Public disclosure of an unmitigated or uncontained cyber incident could lead to additional harm to investors. Cybercriminals often aim to embed themselves in corporate networks without the company knowing, sometimes for years. If the attack is discovered, additional harm could occur if the attack has not yet been contained or mitigated. Requiring public disclosure of uncontained or unmitigated cyber incidents could distort the price of securities. By contradicting best practices for cyber incident response, the premature public disclosure of an incident may provide investors with an inaccurate measure of the companys true ability to respond to cybersecurity incidents. Premature disclosure during an early stage of the incident response process may result in investors receiving inaccurate information about the scope or impact of the incident. SECs proposal requires companies to disclose policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Providing all the information required in this proposal (a detailed description of its cyber risk management program) could compromise a companys ability to defend against future cyber attacks. The SEC has not described why such a level of detail would benefit investors or that the benefits would outweigh the potential consequences to companies that are already victims of cybercriminals or nation state actors.  DHS administered regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information include the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program and the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). CFATS information is safeguarded as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information, and MTSA information is safeguarded as sensitive security information. The SECs proposed amendments are clearly at odds with the determination of  DHS that information about cybersecurity incidents must be kept confidential and not publicly disclosed.  Cybersecurity talent is hard to find. From a personnel standpoint, its unclear where companies would get the so called cybersecurity expertise that the proposed regulation would mandate. There is a well known lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors. In any case, the SEC has not justified that having cybersecurity experts on boards would benefit its cybersecurity protection program. Similarly, investors may see the inclusion of certain individuals on a companys board as an indication of a companys overall cybersecurity program americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000    maturity and as a sign that a company is more secure than another one. Such an outcome could be misleading.  In summary, ACC urges the SEC to significantly revise this proposed rule or maintain the 2018 interpretive guidance. Please contact me at with any questions regarding this submission.   Sincerely,  Bill Gulledge  Bill Gulledge Senior Director, Chemical Products & Technology Division americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000 May 9, 2022  Via: rule comment@sec.gov  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The American Chemistry Council (ACC) submits these comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to the proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. The proposed revisions to the 2018 reporting requirements have significant potential major impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and corporate governance programs.  ACC, in its letter dated May 2, 2022, urged the SEC to extend the comment period by an additional 30 days. The SEC did not approve this request. With the denial, ACC will not respond to the individual questions posed by the SEC in its current request, but the underlying reasons for the request remain:  The proposed amendments to the 2018 reporting requirements have significant potential major impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and corporate governance programs.  Identifying issues and preparing comments to respond to 40 or so questions require considerable thought and resources to prepare useful responses. In addition, we note that the SEC is proposing several other significant notification rules, i.e., climate change, which have overlapping comment periods.  SECs proposed revisions would require near real time and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity incidents. The SEC proposal also requires companies to disclose procedures to address cyber risk, managements role, and expertise in implementing a cyber protection program, and disclosure of the companys board of directors role and expertise on cybersecurity. The information on material cyber incidents would be reported on Form 8 K.  ACC believes the SECs 2018 guidance to publicly traded companies is sufficient in providing information on cybersecurity reporting obligations and provides information that informs investors. As proposed, SECs cyber incident disclosure revisions could expose a  americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  companys security resilience procedures to cyber hackers. Materiality determinations are emphasized over cybersecurity risks.  ACC, through its Responsible Care program, CFATs risk management and reporting requirements, and voluntary cyber risk management initiatives, emphasizes tiered risk management approaches to developing, maintaining, auditing, and revising cyber protection programs. The NIST cyber framework and industry standards and guidelines help form the foundation for these programs. SECs proposal would shift the focus to compliance based reporting rather than the more appropriate focus on managing cyber risks and identifying and resolving cyber incidents.  The SEC proposal was drafted without the consideration of the cyber incident reporting requirements of other federal agencies and the newly enacted cyber incident reporting legislation. ACC members are subject to cyber related rules required by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, the Transportation Security Agency, the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others, depending on the companys scope of activities. Rather than creating additional and potentially conflicting cyber incident reporting requirements, the SEC should coordinate with other federal agencies to harmonize reporting requirements. SECs current proposals could potentially interfere with law enforcement investigations of cyber crimes by diverting corporate and law enforcement resources from investigating and resolving significant cyber incidents.  SEC proposed to amend Form 8 K to require a company to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within 4 business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The SEC argues that such reporting would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures.  Specifically, a company would be required to disclose the following information about a material cybersecurity incident at the time of the Form 8 K filing—  o When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing. o A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident. o Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose. o The effect of the incident on the registrants operations. o Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.  The disclosure requirement of 4 business days could require a company to report while the incident is still ongoing and being managed by the company and/or law enforcement. This could potentially provide attackers with additional information over company cyber defenses.  Companies will have to determine whether a disclosure to SEC would negatively impact its cyber defense program and whether releasing security program information that is considered  americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  confidential by the company will increase its risk to cyber attacks. If companies are required to report detailed information, the disclosure could provide a roadmap to vulnerabilities if malicious actors detected patterns.  Subject to a CISA rulemaking, the new cyber incident reporting legislation (CIRCIA) requires certain owners and/or operators of critical infrastructure to report covered cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours. CIRCIAs 72 hour window compares roughly equally to the Commissions proposed Form 8 K requirement, which stipulates that a company must disclose a material cybersecurity incident to the SEC within 4 business days. However, the SEC does not allow for temporary delays in reporting that may be due to internal investigation of the incident or external investigation, including efforts by law enforcement. Companies should not be required to report if it may compromise an ongoing investigation. The SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement to mitigate cyber incidents, rather than disclose potentially inaccurate information within 4 business days.  ACC members frequently hear from the FBI and DHS/CISA that notifying them is key toward mitigating cybersecurity incidents. Authorities can often figure out the details of a cybersecurity incident—the what, the when, and the how—as the incident moves forward, but the advantages of time and dialogue are important. Companies need time, potentially more than a few business days, to provide law enforcement with key information. The SEC reporting time requirement could undermine the public/private collaboration. Where a federal regulation exists, the SEC should reconsider its position on exemptions and incorporate into its proposed rule an exemption for entities that are subject to and in compliance with similar federal reporting regulations. The SEC also proposes that companies disclose when a series of undisclosed individual immaterial cyber incidents become material in the aggregate. ACC believes that further guidance is required to determine when a series of incidents become material. Potential material incidents would be difficult to track over an undefined period.  SECs proposal requires companies to disclose policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Providing all the information required in this proposal (a detailed description of its cyber risk management program) could compromise a companys ability to defend against future cyber attacks. The SEC has not described why such a level of detail would benefit investors or that the benefits would outweigh the potential consequences to companies that are already victims of cybercriminals or nation state actors.  DHS administered regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information include the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program and the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). CFATS information is safeguarded as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information, and MTSA information is safeguarded as sensitive security information. The SECs proposed amendments are clearly at odds with the determination of   americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  DHS that information about cybersecurity incidents must be kept confidential and not publicly disclosed.  This SEC proposal also requires disclosure of a companys cybersecurity governance, including Board oversight of cybersecurity risk and a description of managements role in assessing and managing cyber risks. The proposal would require companies to disclose whether they have a chief information security officer (CISO), his or her relevant expertise, and where the CISO fits in the entitys organization. The proposal would also require disclosures about the interactions of management and the board on cybersecurity, including the frequency with which the board and management considers cybersecurity risk and related topics. In addition, SECs proposal says. If any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.  ACC believes these proposed requirements dictate that companies take specific cybersecurity actions that are not promoting sound cyber risk management practices and puts the SEC in the position to dictate how companies operate their cybersecurity protection programs.  ACC also objects to disclosing the names of board members with cybersecurity expertise. The SEC should not have any influence on which experts sit on a companys governing body.  Cybersecurity talent is hard to find. From a personnel standpoint, its unclear where companies would get the so called cybersecurity expertise that the proposed regulation would mandate. There is a well known lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors. In any case, the SEC has not justified that having cybersecurity experts on boards would benefit its cybersecurity protection program. Similarly, investors may see the inclusion of certain individuals on a companys board as an indication of a companys overall cybersecurity program maturity and as a sign that a company is more secure than another one. Such an outcome could be misleading.  In summary, ACC urges the SEC to significantly revise this proposed rule or maintain the 2018 interpretive guidance.

Countryman  Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Dear Ms. Countryman:  RE: File Number S7 09 22  Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) proposed rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure (File Number S7 09 22). Cameco supports the SECs desire to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (The Exchange Act).  Cameco is a Canadian corporation and is also a foreign private issuer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it is therefore subject to U.S. periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Further, Cameco is a participant in the SECs multijurisdictional disclosure system (MJDS) for Canadian issuers, which allows eligible Canadian issuers, such as Cameco to register securities under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and to satisfy its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act by use of documents prepared largely in accordance with Canadian requirements. As MJDS registrants, Cameco satisfies its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act by filing its respective annual reports on  Form 40 F and other documents under cover of Form 6 K.  We note that the Proposed Rules did not contemplate any amendments to the current Form 40 F disclosure requirements. In its release, the SEC acknowledged that the MJDS generally permits  CAMECO CORPORATION Corporate Office 2121  11th Street West Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Canada  S�M �J�  Tel 306.956.6200 Fax �().*+).),(� www.cameco.com  Ms. Countryman: November 1, 2022 Page 2   eligible Canadian FPIs to use Canadian disclosure standards and documents to satisfy the SECs registration and disclosure requirements. However, the SEC specifically requested comment on whether MJDS registrants should be required to include the same cybersecurity disclosures in their annual reports on Form 40 F as would be required for U.S. domestic registrants for their annual reports on Form 10 K or other FPIs for their annual reports on Form 20 F.  The MJDS framework appropriately treats the Canadian reporting framework as substantially equivalent to that of the SEC, avoids duplicative and overlapping reporting obligations, and acknowledges that Canadian reporting requirements are sufficient for investors in the United States. We note that MJDS forms will continue to specify that an MJDS registrant must include information in its filings such that its disclosures do not contain material misstatements or omissions.1 We therefore believe the existing disclosure framework for MJDS registrants is sufficient to inform U.S. investors of material cybersecurity risks, strategy, governance, and incidents.  Accordingly, we strongly support the SECs approach of not amending Form 40 F in the proposed rules. We believe imposing prescriptive reporting requirements on MJDS registrants with respect to cybersecurity topics would result in an unnecessary and inefficient incremental burden for registrants already subject to a robust reporting regime in Canada, which is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the MJDS.  We note that Canadian securities regulators have been focused on cybersecurity disclosures for a number of years. For example, the Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA) identified cybersecurity as a priority area in the CSAs 2016 19 Business Plan. The CSA has since issued extensive guidance on disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management practices of Canadian reporting companies and published numerous notices highlighting the importance of cybersecurity to Canadian financial markets and the need for prevention, coordination and remediation plans.2 We understand that cybersecurity matters continue to be an active priority for the CSA3 and that the members of the CSA consider cybersecurity matters as part of their ongoing continuous disclosure reviews applicable to Canadian issuers. We therefore believe the existing disclosure framework for MJDS registrants is sufficient to inform U.S. investors of material cybersecurity risks, strategy, governance, and incidents.  As a result, we strongly suggest that SEC maintains its initial position and not propose any changes to Form 40 F. This position best supports the proposed intent of both the SEC and CSA proposals in their efforts to enable information standardization and comparability for informed investor decision making while balancing increasing reporting and disclosure labour and cost burdens for reporting issuers.

June 22, 2022  Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, DC 20549  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  Our organizations, which represent sectors across the U.S. economy, write to provide input on the Securities and Exchange Commissions proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.  Collectively, our associations appreciate the goals of the SECs proposed rules, which focus on increasing investors knowledge of publicly traded companies cybersecurity postures. We agree with Chair Genslers view that [a] lot of issuers already provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors and that companies and investors alike would benefit if this information were required in a consistent, comparable, and decision useful manner.  However, the SECs proposed reporting regime departs significantly from the Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance, which effectively balances investor interests with companies cybersecurity disclosure obligations. The proposed rules could result in undermining cybersecurity by forcing companies to disclose incident information prior to the mitigation of vulnerabilities. Detailed public disclosures could give cybercriminals and state backed hackers a trove of data to further victimize companies, harm law enforcement investigations, and disrupt public private responses to cyberattacks. Also, the costs of the rulemaking outweigh its benefits to investors. Simply put, the proposed rules go too far and would place companies at heightened risk by compelling them to prematurely disclose increased amounts of cybersecurity incident information.  Many in the business community strongly believe that the Commissions proposal should not be finalized in its current form. Calibrating the rulemaking correctly requires the SEC to proceed with caution and coordinate with other parts of the federal government. Given the complexity of the proposal, as well as its impact on U.S. economic security and cybersecurity, the Commission should allow more time for industry input.  While this list is not exhaustive of our groups views, we urge the Commission to consider the following points as it seeks to develop a cybersecurity incident and risk management disclosure regime that both informs investors and protects companies against malicious actors.  2  • The disclosure of cybersecurity incidents should accommodate temporary delays for law enforcement and/or ongoing investigations. The Commissions proposed rules need to be revised so that companies can temporarily delay reporting on material cybersecurity incidents because of law enforcement and/or ongoing national security investigations against illicit hackers where U.S. cybersecurity is at stake. Instead of undercutting industry government cooperation, the SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement and national security agencies to mitigate the impacts of cyber incidents and help bolster companies security and financial positions, which would benefit investors.  More specifically, all 50 U.S. states have passed laws authorizing delayed disclosures to consumers of breaches of their sensitive personal data to avoid compromising an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act similarly authorizes such delayed disclosure by financial institutions, and federal law enforcement agencies make such requests of registrants in appropriate circumstances. Without a corresponding law enforcement exception, the proposed rules would undermine the judgment of the states and several federal agencies that law enforcement protects the public first.  The Commissions proposed rules should enable companies to delay disclosures due to active investigations by law enforcement and other reasonable requests (e.g., to remediate a cybersecurity incident) like other state and federal reporting laws. Companies need time to conduct internal investigations to accurately determine an incidents true scope and impact. The proposed rules could easily compel companies to make premature disclosures driven more by compliance timelines than genuine cybersecurity incident remediation factors. Companies are rightly concerned that SEC requirements mandating them to report incident and vulnerability information too early could place them at greater risk.  Further, hasty reporting may not necessarily be accurate, given the little time afforded to companies to report material cybersecurity incidents. It is possible that the severity of incidents could be overstated, thus having a potentially negative effect on a companys earnings.  • The rulemaking should not override laws and regulations related to cybersecurity and protected disclosures. The Commissions proposal overwhelmingly conflicts with the policy goals established by Congress in recent cybersecurity legislation, especially the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which was signed into law on March 15—less than a week after the SEC announced its cybersecurity proposal. The new law requires certain critical infrastructure entities to report on a confidential and protected basis covered cyber incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours. Congress intended CISA to be the primary entity for reporting cybersecurity incidents to the federal government. Lawmakers also said that a business should only have to report to federal agencies once. 3 Congress has explicitly emphasized the importance of protecting cybersecurity incident data from unwarranted disclosures. For companies that perform work for the Department of Defense (DoD), the SECs proposed rules neither recognize nor align with the evolving cybersecurity standards and disclosures required of these contractors. Several years ago, DoD initiated a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program for contractors that seeks to leverage existing standards associated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800 171 to protect controlled unclassified information in nonfederal systems and organizations. The SEC does not appear to consider the potentially contradictory, unnecessarily duplicative, or financially burdensome nature of its proposed rules when compared with the CMMC requirements.  Requirements under the CMMC process are evolving as DoD continues to adjudicate industry comments regarding its September 2020 interim rule, while working to publish another interim rule in early 2023. The CMMC process holds companies to a higher standard of cybersecurity than what is required of government agencies. The Commission appears to do the same with its proposed rules, which contributes to an imbalance of public and private sector responsibilities.*  Congress also clarified that vulnerability information should be coordinated based on principles consistent with international standards and leading industry practices requiring protection and strict confidence.  • The practicality and value of disclosing aggregate cybersecurity incidents are unclear. The proposed rules would require a company to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. The Commissions proposal is notably vague about when a number of individual cybersecurity incidents—taken together—would be considered materially reportable. Only in hindsight and with considerable business and government effort can some hacking campaigns be grouped together. The Commission does not seem to consider the costs and the difficulty of identifying and tracking material incidents in the aggregate. The feasibility and value of aggregate reporting to investors is questionable.  • The unprecedented micromanagement of companies cybersecurity programs is misguided and would not necessarily protect investors. The proposed rules embody an unnecessary micromanagement pertaining to the composition and functioning of both the management and the boards of companies. The SEC should not insert itself via disclosure rules into how a company would design its plans to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents. The proposed rules could put companies in jeopardy by forcing them to allocate resources toward compliance based reporting rather than triaging the complex elements of identifying and resolving cybersecurity incidents. If shared prematurely, the  * Additional federal laws and regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information include the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards program, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards program, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. 4  public disclosure of vulnerability data could give attackers a roadmap to exploit reporting registrants.  Similarly, disclosing the finer points of a companys cybersecurity policies and processes is excessive. This requirement would make the registrant an attractive target for malicious actors that could acquire unwarranted insights into a companys practices and develop a game plan for future exploitation. A cybersecurity program reflects a companys tailoring of the relevant laws, regulations, and standards that fit its unique structure and business environment. The proposed governance disclosures, moreover, take a detailed, one size fits all approach, which implies best practices that would not make operational sense to each company.  • Agencies, including the SEC, need to prioritize streamlining reporting regulations. The SECs proposed rules leave businesses in the unfavorable position of facing conflicting cybersecurity reporting directives from several government entities. There needs to be more assertive streamlining of cybersecurity incident reporting policies to enable businesses to understand and follow clear and consistent guidelines and requirements. CIRCIA calls on the national cyber director (NCD) to lead an intergovernmental Cyber Incident Reporting Council composed of the Office of Management and Budget, CISA, and sector risk management agencies to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize federal incident reporting requirements, including those issued through regulations. Considering CIRCIA, the SEC should collaborate with other federal agencies and cybersecurity policymakers, including the NCD, to both coordinate its proposed rules with other authorities and determine whether its requirements are advisable as written.  • Company boards should prioritize managing cyber risks but not through SEC mandates requiring cybersecurity expertise. Our associations advocate for companies to proactively prioritize cyber risk management activities, but they are concerned about the SECs call for companies to disclose the name of any board member who has cybersecurity expertise. We believe that board experts should not proliferate via government directives. Prescriptive disclosures intended to drive company behavior regarding which subject matter experts sit on companies governing bodies could lead to unwieldy and unwanted outcomes (e.g., giving investors a false sense of confidence because of the presence of a board cybersecurity expert).  Also, cybersecurity talent is scarce globally. It is unclear where companies would get the cybersecurity experts that would be driven by the Commissions proposed requirement to disclosure such expertise. There is a well established lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors that would impede companies abilities to recruit board cybersecurity experts. The SECs proposal could even create unintended barriers for historically underrepresented groups to move into cybersecurity management or board leadership roles—not due to the lack of qualifications but to the absence of formal credentials (e.g., owing to their costs) and other certifications. Even if companies could obtain the relevant cybersecurity experts for board positions, no evidence has been 5  convincingly shown that this requirement would inform investors or improve companies cybersecurity preparedness.  It is unlikely that even organizations such as NIST could readily pinpoint what constitutes expertise or experience in cybersecurity that would earn widespread agreement among industry professionals. Advancements in cybersecurity occur rapidly. Overseeing internal and external experts who are current in the field is more valuable than directors having outdated credentials. The SEC should accommodate a broader array of experiences than what the proposed rules list of cybersecurity expert criteria encompasses. Consider Item 407s definition of an audit committee financial expert. It indicates, for example, that while a chief executive officer may not simultaneously serve as the companys accountant, this person may serve as an audit committee financial expert on the board because he or she has experience overseeing the accounting function at the company. Likewise, a suitable board cybersecurity expert may come from company management and not have formal schooling or training, but this individual understands cybersecurity practices and/or has experience supervising the companys personnel who are engaged in cybersecurity activities.  • The term cybersecurity incident should be narrowed to correspond with significant incidents that do actual harm and existing definitions. The scope of the SECs definition of a cybersecurity incident is overly expansive. It should not be construed broadly, as the Commission suggests. For reasons of consistency, agencies should avoid defining terms through their own processes. A reportable cybersecurity incident should track more closely with a covered cyber incident in CIRCIA or Presidential Policy Directive, United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD 41). PPD 41 refers to a significant cyber incident as a cyber incident that is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. Material cybersecurity disclosures should correspond to significant incidents that do actual harm.  In addition, companies need clarity in reporting requirements, which should be targeted to clear, objective criteria in any rule that the SEC—with industry input—develops. The definition of a cybersecurity incident, as currently written, would lead to the overreporting of cybersecurity incidents and not serve investors decision making well.  Our organizations support responsible and protected cybersecurity reporting to the government, consumers, and investors, but we oppose the SECs proposed rules as written. The proposal runs counter to sound cybersecurity policies and practices. It should be revised to better balance transparency with cybersecurity. We are ready to work with the Commission to develop a rulemaking that provides timely information to investors while mitigating risks associated with disclosing sensitive cybersecurity information to the public.

We compiled the attached statement on the basis of our past and ongoing audit, evaluation, investigation, and review work; our knowledge of the SECs programs and operations; and information from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and SEC management and staff. We reviewed the agencys response to prior years statements, and assessed its efforts to address recommendations for corrective action related to persistent challenges. We previously provided a draft of this statement to SEC officials and considered all comments received when finalizing the statement. As we begin fiscal year 2023, we again identified the following as areas where the SEC faces management and performance challenges to varying degrees: • Meeting Regulatory Oversight Responsibilities • Protecting Systems and Data • Improving Contract Management • Ensuring Effective Human Capital Management Information on the challenge areas and the corresponding audit, evaluation, investigation, or review work are discussed in the attachment. If you have any questions, please contact me or Rebecca L. Sharek, Deputy Inspector General for Audits, Evaluations, and Special Projects. 1 Pub. L.

For example, some reported an overall increase in attrition (discussed further on page 21 of this document) and difficulties hiring individuals with rulemaking experience. In the interim, managers reported relying on detailees, in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking. Others told us that they may have not received as much feedback during the rulemaking process, either as a result of shortened timelines during the drafting process or because of shortened public comment periods. Although no one we met with identified errors that had been made, some believed that the more aggressive agenda—particularly as it relates to high profile rules that significantly impact external stakeholders—potentially (1) limits the time available for staff research and analysis, and (2) increases litigation risk. Finally, some managers noted that fewer resources have been available to complete other mission related work, as rulemaking teams have borrowed staff from other organizational areas to assist with rulemaking activities. Furthermore, the SECs rulemaking function relies on coordination and collaboration amongst several agency divisions and offices and, as we reported in our October 2021 statement on the SECs management and performance challenges, agency leaders should take measures to strengthen communication and coordination across SEC components. Indeed, the SECs fiscal year (FY) 2021 Agency Financial Report states that the SEC values teamwork and recognizes that success depends on a skilled, diverse, coordinated team committed to the highest standards of trust, hard work, cooperation, and communication.9 Additionally, the SECs strategic plan identifies teamwork of the SECs staff and its leaders, along with other elements, as the foundation of the agency.10 To support the strategic plans Goal 3  Elevate the SECs performance by enhancing our analytical capabilities and human capital development  the SEC committed to the following initiative: 3.5 Promote collaboration within and across SEC offices to ensure we are communicating effectively across the agency, including through evaluation of key internal processes that require significant collaboration.11 In response to our October 2021 statement on the SECs management and performance challenges, agency management re affirmed its commitment to promoting effective and collaborative information sharing across the agency.12 Managements continued attention to strengthening communication and coordination across divisions and offices is instrumental to (1) preventing unintentional negative impacts to divisions and offices when modifying agency wide processes, (2) maintaining positive trends in employee views on collaboration,13 and (3) achieving the goals established in the SECs strategic plan. 9 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year 2021 Agency Financial Report; November 15, 2021. 10 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2018 2022, Goal 3; October 11, 2018. 11 The agencys draft strategic plan for FY 2022 to FY 2026 (Goal 3) similarly emphasizes the importance of continually strengthening and promoting collaboration within and across SEC offices. 12 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year 2021 Agency Financial Report; November 15, 2021. 13 With regards to the 2021 Federal Employee Viewpoint survey, 71 percent of agency respondents agreed that SEC managers promote communication among different work units (a 4 percentage point decrease from the previous year). In addition, 75 percent of agency respondents agreed that SEC managers support collaboration across work units to accomplish work objectives (a 3 percentage point decrease from the previous year). 3    SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 • Moved its Tracking and Reporting Examination National Documentation System (TRENDS) to a new, cloud based platform, which is expected to improve the systems adaptability, workflow capability, and data standardization; • Launched a new examination support service, which among other things, assists examiners with data staging, cleansing, transformation, enrichment, and analysis; and • Advanced its centralized asset verification program, which, according to EXAMS management, has enabled growth in the number of exams involving asset verification, as well as the amount of assets verified during these exams.24 Although EXAMS took these and other steps to increase efficiencies, we also reported that controls over the RIA examination planning processes needed improvement. Specifically, we found some staff commenced substantive RIA examination procedures before management approved the examination pre fieldwork phase, and staff did not always consistently maintain key documents in TRENDS. In addition, we were unable to find documentation indicating that an examination supervisor notified registrants of non EXAMS staff participation, as required. We recommended that management (1) develop controls that help ensure timely supervisory approval of an examinations pre fieldwork phase; (2) reiterate to examination staff and management the importance of and requirements for timely supervisory approval of each examinations pre fieldwork phase; and (3) review examination documentation requirements regarding communications with registrants to ensure they are clear and examiners maintain such documentation in a consistent manner, and update examination policies as needed. Management concurred with our recommendations, which, as of the date of this document, are open and will be closed upon completion and verification of corrective action taken. As we begin FY 2023, we will continue to monitor agency plans and actions to improve controls around supervisory approval of examinations pre fieldwork phase and documentation requirements regarding communications with registrants. Use of Technology and Analytics to Meet Mission Requirements and Respond to Significant Developments and Trends As we reported in previous years, agency management and the OIG continue to recognize the importance of technology and analytics in the SECs ability to efficiently and effectively meet mission requirements and respond to significant developments and trends in the evolving capital markets. The SECs strategic plan (Goals 2 and 3, and related strategic initiatives) reflects the importance of these efforts.25 Additionally, according to the SECs FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, the economys reliance on the rapidly changing field of data analytics is growing, and the Commission needs to adjust by 24 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Registered Investment Adviser Examinations: EXAMS Has Made Progress To Assess Risk and Optimize Limited Resources, But Could Further Improve Controls Over Some Processes (Report No. 571, January 25, 2022). 25 The agencys draft strategic plan for FY 2022 to FY 2026 (Goals 1, 2, and 3) similarly emphasizes that the SEC must effectively use technology and data. 6     SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 Although we acknowledge the Office of Market Intelligences use of analytics and implementation of a new TCR system, the TCR program—along with many other critical programs and systems within the SEC—must rely on personnel to correctly input data into systems. For example, with the handling of TCRs, agency staff from divisions and offices must be sure to correctly transfer TCRs to the Office of Market Intelligence. As noted in a management letter our office issued in May 2021, we identified 2 matters of 3,303 we reviewed that were not transferred from the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy to the TCR system.28 Moreover, in FY 2022, we investigated the former SEC Ombudsman and found that the former Ombudsman failed to enter TCRs on investor matters received by the Office of the Ombudsman that warranted entry, as required by the SECs Commission Wide Policies and Procedures for Handling TCRs. Specifically, the agencys policy and corresponding administrative regulation29 state that all SEC staff are responsible for entering TCRs into the TCR system or forwarding them to a TCR point of contact within specified timeframes, and when in doubt, staff should err on the side of entering a TCR. Instead, the former Ombudsman directed staff within the Office of the Ombudsman to refer investors to enter their own TCRs on matters related to alleged securities law violations or fraud. As previously noted, through the TCR program, the SEC receives and responds to credible allegations SEC investor protection efforts Improper handling of TCRs may impede of possible violations of the federal securities laws. Improper handling of TCRs may impede the SECs ability to timely and effectively protect investors. Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess how well the SEC effectively and efficiently meets its regulatory oversight responsibilities. We will follow up on open recommendations intended to improve controls around the examination program, and we will complete an ongoing audit of the SECs whistleblower program and an evaluation of Enforcements efforts and goals to expedite investigations, where possible and appropriate. Finally, we will initiate a review of the SECs oversight of entity compliance with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS.30 28 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Final Management Letter: Actions May Be Needed To Improve Processes for Receiving and Coordinating Investor Submissions (May 24, 2021). 29 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC Administrative Regulation 3 2, Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR) Intake Policy; November 29, 2016. 30 Regulation Best Interest, the new Form CRS Relationship Summary, and two separate interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 are part of a package of rulemakings and interpretations adopted by the Commission on June 5, 2019, to enhance and clarify the standards of conduct applicable to broker dealers and investment advisers, help retail investors better understand and compare the services offered and make an informed choice of the relationship best suited to their needs and circumstances, and foster greater consistency in the level of protections provided by each regime, particularly at the point in time that a recommendation is made. 8   SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 Evaluating and Addressing the Cause(s) and Impact of a Material Weakness Related to Insufficient User Access Controls In its FY 2021 Agency Financial Report, the SEC disclosed a newly discovered material weakness associated with lack of controls related to user access to a Commission system. Specifically, the SEC reported that the information tracking and document storage system for documents related to recommendations for certain Commission actions did not include controls sufficient to prevent access by staff who should not view such documents.35 This is important because, while the Commission has both investigatory and adjudicatory responsibilities, the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates the separation of those functions among the agency staff who assist the Commission in each.36 Therefore, agency employees who are investigating or prosecuting an adjudicatory matter before the Commission generally may not participate in the Commissions decision making in that or a factually related matter. However, the identified user access control deficiency did not ensure the necessary separation of the Commissions enforcement and adjudicatory functions for administrative adjudications. The SECs FY 2021 Agency Financial Report further noted that, while a review of the affected system was underway, action had been taken to remediate the control deficiency. Then, in April 2022, the Commission released a statement that provided additional information about the control deficiency, along with the results of the SECs review of the impact of the control deficiency on two ongoing federal court litigations: SEC v. Cochran, No. 21 1239 (S. Ct.), and Jarkesy v. SEC, No. 20 61007 (5th Cir.). The statement reads, in part: The Commission has determined that, for a period of time, certain databases maintained by the Commissions Office of the Secretary were not configured to restrict access by Enforcement personnel to memoranda drafted by Adjudication staff. As a result, in a number of adjudicatory matters, administrative support personnel from Enforcement, who were responsible for maintaining Enforcements case files, accessed Adjudication memoranda via the Office of the Secretarys databases. Those individuals then emailed Adjudication memoranda to other administrative staff who in many cases uploaded the files into Enforcement databases.37 With respect to these two matters, according to the Commissions statement, agency enforcement staff had access to certain adjudicatory memoranda, but this access did not impact the actions taken by the staff investigating and prosecuting the cases or the Commissions decision making in the matters. The SEC is continuing to review and has not yet disclosed the full impact the internal control deficiency caused by the insufficient user access controls had on the remaining affected adjudicatory matters. The Commissions statement indicated that the agencys review team will continue to assess the remaining 35 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Agency Financial Report Fiscal Year 2021; November 15, 2021. 36 Pub. L. 79 404 60 Stat. 240 (June 11, 1946). 37 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commission Statement Relating to Certain Administrative Adjudications; April 5, 2022. 10 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 The SEC also has an open recommendation from a recent GAO report on assessing security controls related to telework. The CARES Act of 2020 contains a provision for GAO to monitor the federal response to the pandemic. Specifically, GAO was asked to examine federal agencies preparedness to support expanded telework. In September 2021, GAO issued its report, which contained two recommendations for the SEC regarding the assessment and documentation of relevant IT security controls and enhancements.40 Although the agencys comments to the report state that the SEC expected to complete actions to remediate the recommendations by the second quarter of FY 2022, as of September 15, 2022, remediation work was still underway for the recommendation related to ensuring that the agency documents relevant IT security controls and enhancements in the security plan for the system that provides remote access for telework. GAO concluded that if agencies do not sufficiently document relevant security controls, assess the controls, and fully document remedial actions for weaknesses identified in security controls, then agencies are at increased risk that vulnerabilities in their systems that provide remote access could be exploited. The SEC also faces cybersecurity challenges with respect to its access, use, and security of data available through the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). Pursuant to an SEC rule (Rule 613), self regulatory organizations have submitted a national market system plan to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated order tracking system, or CAT, that when fully implemented will capture customer and order event information for orders in national market system securities, across all markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution. In its FY 2023 budget request, the SEC noted that the CAT continues to roll out functionality as the phased launch of broker dealer reporting and regulator functionality progresses. Because CAT data is highly sensitive, the SEC must continue working to establish an environment and applications to appropriately secure the data accessed and used by the SEC as it becomes available. Maturing the SECs Information Security Program Effective information security controls are essential to protecting the SECs information systems and the data contained therein. To help the SEC establish and maintain effective information security controls and to comply with FISMA, the OIG annually evaluates the SECs implementation of FISMA information security requirements and the effectiveness of the agencys information security program on a maturity model scale.41 The OIG contracted with Kearney & Company, P.C. (Kearney) to conduct the FY 2021 independent evaluation and, on December 21, 2021, issued the report titled, Fiscal Year 2021 Independent Evaluation of SECs Implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Report No. 570).42 As stated in Report No. 570, since FY 2020, OIT improved aspects of the SECs information security program. Among other actions taken, the SEC refined its management of security training roles and responsibilities, enhanced its security training strategy, implemented the agencys policy for specialized security training, optimized a vulnerability disclosure policy, refined its configuration management 40 U.S. Government Accountability Office, COVID 19: Selected Agencies Overcame Technology Challenges to Support Telework but Need to Fully Assess Security Controls (GAO 21 583, September 2021). 41 Pub. L. No. 113 283, § 3555, 128 Stat. 3073 (2014). 42 As previously stated, the FY 2022 FISMA evaluation is ongoing and will be completed in the first quarter of FY 2023. 12     SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 FY 2017,44 one from FY 2018,45 and two from FY 202046). We commend agency management for the actions taken to date, and encourage management to promptly act on all opportunities for improvement identified in previous FISMA reports to help minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, use, and disruption of the SECs sensitive, non public information, and to assist the agencys information security program reach the next maturity level. Finally, we continue to track the agencys progress related to an audit of the SECs enterprise architecture (Additional Steps Are Needed For the SEC To Implement a Well Defined Enterprise Architecture; Report No. 568, issued September 29, 2021). In our report, we highlighted six recommendations to improve the SECs implementation of a well defined enterprise architecture (four of which remain open), and one recommendation to improve the SECs oversight of enterprise architecture support services contracts (which is closed). We understand that the agency has efforts underway to develop an enterprise roadmap for future years, and the remaining four recommendations will be closed upon completion and verification of corrective action taken. Fully implementing recommended corrective actions from these audits and evaluations may assist the SEC as it seeks to mature aspects of its information security program, generally, and its IT program and program management, specifically. Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess the SECs efforts to secure its systems and data and mature its information security program. Specifically, we will continue to assess the reported user access control deficiency matter, follow up on open recommendations, complete the ongoing FY 2022 FISMA evaluation, and initiate the FY 2023 FISMA evaluation. We will also review the SECs efforts to establish a secure environment and applications to use CAT data, determine whether the SEC implemented adequate security controls to safeguard information and IT resources during maximum telework, and assess steps the SEC has planned or taken to address zero trust requirements. 44 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Audit of the SECs Compliance With the Federal Information Security Modernization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Report No. 546; March 30, 2018). 45 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Fiscal Year 2018 Independent Evaluation of SECs Implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Report No. 552; December 17, 2018). 46 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Fiscal Year 2020 Independent Evaluation of SECs Implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Report No. 563; December 21, 2020). 14     Management of IT acquisitions and operations is a high risk area across the executive branch SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 A growing majority of contract support concentrated in IT services—and, therefore, in those segments of the agencys acquisition workforce that procure, administer, and oversee contracts for such services— potentially increases the risk to the SEC. Indeed, since 2015, GAO has reported that management of IT acquisitions and operations is a high risk area needing attention by the executive branch and Congress, stating, federal IT investments too frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission related outcomes. These investments often suffer from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance.52 We have previously reported on needed improvements in the SECs management of IT investments.53 And while last July the SEC completed efforts sufficient to close our remaining recommendations for corrective action stemming from that report, the agency has also increased its investments (and, therefore, its potential risk) related to IT service contracts. Notably, the SEC procures many of its IT services through its OneIT enterprise contract vehicle, which has a 10 year ordering period and a contract ceiling of $2.5 billion. In September 2018, the SEC began awarding time and material (T&M), labor hour (LH), and firm fixed price task orders under the OneIT contract vehicle, which included separate pools for small businesses only (restricted) and all awardees, including large businesses (unrestricted). As of June 2022, the agency had awarded task orders to 27 companies, including 5 large businesses and 22 small businesses, obligating a total of almost $450 million for task orders under this vehicle. The SECs Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) collaborated with key stakeholders to advertise to vendors opportunities and specifics of the OneIT program. This advertising included a publically available brochure targeted to minority owned and women owned businesses. OMWI received positive feedback and is looking to expand the concept to other large SEC contracts being awarded. As such, the SECs Office of Acquisitions (OA) and OMWI are continuing to work collaboratively to increase outreach to minority owned and women owned businesses and continue efforts to increase the SECs vendor diversity. Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion OA and OMWI are collaborating to voluntarily implement the requirements of Executive Order 13895, which states that the federal government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.54 This advancing of equality includes promoting equitable delivery of government benefits and equitable opportunities, such as government contracting and procurement opportunities, which should be available on an equal basis to all eligible providers of goods and services. 52 U.S. Government Accountability Office, HIGH RISK SERIES Dedicated Leadership Needed to Address Limited Progress in Most High Risk Areas (GAO 21 119SP, March 2021). 53 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, The SEC Has Processes To Manage Information Technology Investments But Improvements Are Needed (Report No. 555; September 19, 2019). 54 Executive Order 13895, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government; January 20, 2021. Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the provisions of this Executive Order. 17 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 Additionally, recent OMB guidance implements commitments to increase the share of contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses to 15 percent by 2025.55 To do this, OMB directs federal agencies to take specific management actions, including increasing the number of new entrants to the federal marketplace and reversing the general decline in the small business supplier base. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is a focus of OA and, in its FY 2023 budget request, OA requested two additional positions to support a number of priorities, including support for workload increases to review and expand diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in contracting opportunities. Furthermore, OMWI continues to collaborate with OA to promote access to contracting and sub contracting opportunities for minority owned and women owned businesses, through outreach activities. In March 2022, we initiated an audit to (1) assess the SECs processes for encouraging small business participation in agency contracting, in accordance with federal laws and regulations; and (2) determine whether, in FYs 2020 and 2021, the SEC accurately reported small business awards. The audit is ongoing and will be completed in FY 2023. T&M Contracts Since our 2019 statement on the SECs management and performance challenges, we have reported that T&M contracts (including LH contracts) lack incentives for contractors to control costs or use labor efficiently and, therefore, are considered higher risk.56 Last year, we noted again that the SECs use of T&M contracts has continued to increase. We encouraged management to assess the SECs use of these contracts and to formulate actions to reduce their use whenever possible. In response, agency management committed to continuing to closely monitor its use of T&M contracts and exercise rigorous oversight of these types of contracts.57 Management further noted that OA has made a number of improvements to better manage T&M contracts, including a new independent government cost estimate guide, contract compliance reviews, information sharing on T&M invoicing, and an automated determination and findings workflow for more robust and consistent support for the use of T&M contracts. To date, we have not fully assessed the effectiveness of managements reported additional controls;58 however, the annual amount obligated to T&M contracts continues to raise concerns about risk to the SEC. As Figure 6 shows, according to data from usaspending.gov, the total amount obligated to T&M contracts increased since FY 2018 from about 40 percent to about 53 percent of all SEC contract obligations (which are declining).59 In addition, as of October 7, 2022, 476 of the SECs 1,055 total active contracts (or about 45 percent) were T&M contracts. 55 Office of Management and Budget, Memorandum M 22 03, Advancing Equity in Federal Procurement; December 2, 2021. 56 As stated in Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.602, Labor hour contracts, LH contracts are a variation of T&M contracts and differ only in that materials are not supplied by the contractor. 57 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Fiscal Year 2021 Agency Financial Report; November 15, 2021. 58 We plan to initiate an audit of this issue in FY 2023. 59 According to usaspending.gov, total (that is, cumulative) award obligations for all active SEC contracts as of October 7, 2022, was about $2.40 billion, of which total award obligations for T&M contracts was about $1.28 billion. 18 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess the SECs contract management and acquisition processes through audits and evaluations and the work of our Acquisitions Working Group. We will complete an ongoing audit of the SECs small business contracting program. In addition, we will assess the SECs use of T&M contracts to help ensure such contracts are used only when appropriate and effective controls are in place to minimize the risk to the government. Lastly, we will report on any acquisition related matters identified as a result of other ongoing and planned reviews of SEC programs and operations, and continue to support the SECs efforts to train contracting officers and contracting officers representatives about the potential for procurement related fraud. 20    SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 The SEC is not alone in facing a crisis to retain mission critical talent during what has been dubbed The Great Resignation. Critical elements of the federal workforce are in a state of stress. For example, according to the Partnership for Public Service, FY 2021 government wide attrition rates averaged 6.1 percent, with certain groups experiencing even higher rates, such as women (6.4 percent) and executives (9.2 percent).66 The SEC may be able to address some of the concerns surrounding attrition by ensuring that it provides for succession planning through robust employee development and performance management. For example, in August 2022, the SEC launched a new program called LEAD (Leadership, Evaluation, Accession, and Development) to help SEC employees develop the leadership skills necessary to apply for future Senior Officer opportunities. However, performance management remains an area of opportunity for growth. For example, the SEC has discontinued the Performance Incentive Bonus program it implemented just 1 year ago. In addition, one recommendation from our 2018 report entitled, The SEC Made Progress But Work Remains To Address Human Capital Management Challenges and Align With the Human Capital Framework, remains open.67 This recommendation—for the SEC to finalize standard operating procedures for the agencys performance management program—is an important component of the SECs effort to ensure effective performance management. Agency management has reported that remediation work is underway, yet limited resources and competing priorities have created delays. In FY 2023, GAO is set to issue its triennial report on personnel management within the SEC,68 which should provide further guidance to the SEC in this area. Recruitment and Hiring Recruitment is a major area of interest to both OHR and OMWI. Recruitment efforts are critical to ensuring a skilled and diverse candidate pool from which to fill SEC vacancies. In its FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, the SEC requested a total of 5,261 positions, an increase of 454 positions from FY 2022, in which the SEC was authorized 4,807 positions. With FY 2022 attrition rates estimated to be at 6.4 percent—or about 289 positions—efforts to recruit and hire an additional 454 new positions in FY 2023 could present challenges for OHR, OMWI, and SEC management. Moreover, the federal government is facing stiff competition from the private sector as increased wages and workforce engagement make private sector positions attractive to both new and seasoned professionals. The federal government hiring process also has been cited as a detriment when attracting talent to the federal government. For example, the federal government takes on average 98 days—more than twice as long as the private sector—to hire a new employee. 69 During our recent audit of the SECs hiring process, discussed in more detail below, we found that of the 438 external hiring actions that we included in our analysis, nearly 50 percent took 100 business days or more to complete.70 66 Partnership for Public Service.

Roadmap for Renewing Our Federal Government. 70 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, The SEC Can Improve in Several Areas Related to Hiring (Report No. 572; February 28, 2022). 23    SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 To address some of these recruitment concerns, OHR recently issued its FY 2022 2024 Recruitment and Outreach Strategic Plan, which identifies strategies to attract diverse talent and to aid in filling mission critical occupations that have been deemed hard to fill. Such strategies include creating branding and marketing that speaks to prospective applicants; developing and implementing a multi media recruitment and agency branding campaign that highlights the successes of current SEC employees; developing a comprehensive internal communications strategy; and creating an overarching recruitment, outreach, and engagement tool to enhance the recruitment process. Given the importance of an effective process when recruiting and hiring new employees, and the likelihood that the SEC will be heading into an intensive hiring effort, the OIG recently reviewed the SECs hiring process and identified areas for improvement. The OIGs audit report, The SEC Can Improve in Several Areas Related to Hiring, addressed a number of critical areas related to the SECs hiring process.71 First, we determined that management can improve its controls to ensure Workforce Transformation and Tracking System (WTTS) data fields are accurate, consistent, and complete. We found that: • 83 of the 91 hiring actions sampled (or about 91 percent) had at least one data entry issue in the WTTS data fields we reviewed, and almost 9 percent of the WTTS data entries we reviewed were either inaccurate, inconsistent, or incomplete; • the SECs WTTS data continued to include unannotated anomalies; and • certain hiring actions were not consistently identified in WTTS. These conditions occurred because (1) OHRs WTTS job aid did not include sufficient instructions regarding the dates and information expected in key WTTS data fields, and (2) some data fields were not included on the WTTS reports used by OHR staff to ensure the SECs hiring action data was accurate, complete, and consistently recorded. As a result, OHR can further improve the reliability of the SECs WTTS data to assist in workforce management and internal and external reporting of agency hiring information. In addition, our assessment of OHRs quarterly Service Level Commitment (SLC) reviews found that (1) OHR did not perform SLC reviews in a consistent manner, (2) the review process was inefficient and prone to inaccuracies, and (3) SLC reviews did not align with the SLC presented to and agreed upon by the other SEC divisions and offices. This occurred because OHR did not establish clear guidance, including in the SLC itself, for the variety of hiring types and scenarios that can occur, or how to measure each one. The organization also did not ensure it could measure the SLC steps, as presented, in WTTS and did not effectively use the WTTS reporting capabilities in its SLC reviews. As a result, OHR limited its ability to rely on the SLC and SLC reviews as key controls for efficiently and effectively identifying areas of needed improvement in the SECs hiring process, and for collaborating with the divisions and offices OHR serves. Furthermore, we found that the SECs pay setting guidance needed improvement and OHR could clarify the new hire pay setting information shared both internally and externally. Specifically, (1) the pay setting 71 Id. 24     SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 information available to SEC employees and hiring officials was not comprehensive, (2) the internally published pay matrices were outdated, and (3) publicly advertised SEC salary information was misleading for new hires. We also identified inaccuracies in some of the underlying pay band information included in the 2021 pay matrices, and other pay setting concerns. Incomplete, outdated, and misleading new hire pay setting guidance and information have caused confusion and may have limited hiring officials ability to review and respond to pay setting requests. Although it does not appear that inaccurate information in the 2021 pay matrices impacted any newly hired SEC employees pay, it could have had certain hiring scenarios occurred. We also concluded that OHR generally complied with the key hiring authority requirements tested; however, staffing case files for 18 of 32 attorney hiring actions we reviewed (about 56 percent) lacked supporting documentation, including proof of law degrees and/or bar membership. This occurred because OHR did not clarify review processes and documentation requirements for attorney qualifications. In addition, OHRs internal reviews of staffing case files needed improvement. As a result, the SEC risked hiring attorneys who did not meet all qualifications required for their position. Lastly, we identified a matter that did not warrant recommendations related to (1) the SECs SLC as compared to the Office of Personnel Managements end to end hiring process model timelines, and (2) feedback from the SEC divisions and offices OHR serves. We discussed this matter with agency management for their consideration. We made 11 recommendations to further strengthen the SECs controls over hiring actions, including recommendations to improve (1) the reliability of WTTS data, (2) assessments of the agencys hiring timelines, (3) the agencys compensation program, and (4) staffing case file documentation requirements. Management concurred with all 11 of our recommendations and, as of the date of this document, had taken action sufficient to close 5 of them. The remaining recommendations are open and will be closed by the OIG upon completion and verification of corrective action. Responding to COVID 19: Workforce Perspectives Responding to the COVID 19 pandemic has been a central concern of the SEC, and the federal government as a whole, throughout FY 2022. Since the outset of the national public health crisis and economic threats caused by COVID 19, the SECs operational efforts have centered, first and foremost, on the health and safety of its employees, the employees and customers of its registrants, and individuals generally. From March 2020 through August 8, 2021, the SEC was in a mandatory telework posture, which aligned with other federal government agencies. Indeed, the federal government workforce quickly increased from 3 percent of employees teleworking every day to nearly 60 percent, as the 2020 Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey shows.72 However, as vaccines became more widely available, the SEC shifted its focus to how to best and most safely allow employees to return to the workplace. 72 Office of Personnel Management, Government wide Management Report: Results from the 2020 OPM Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey; April 26, 2021. 25   SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SECs Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 On August 9, 2021, the agency began to allow vaccinated employees to voluntarily return to the Safety remains a top priority when planning for employee return to the workplace. In calendar year 2022, peak occupancy workplace across all SEC building locations has averaged around 7 percent. The SEC has not yet mandated that its employees return to the office in pre COVID 19 levels. On July 25, 2022, the agency announced that, because of the recent uptick in COVID 19 community levels, the planned return to office date was shifted from September 6, 2022, to January 9, 2023. Occurring alongside the agencys monitoring of community levels, the SEC is also negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union, which will include updated provisions related to telework and remote work. The parties are also engaged in bargaining related to the mandatory return to office plan. While these negotiations are ongoing, both the National Treasury Employees Union and SEC leadership make regular announcements to staff and management, respectively, about their progress. At this point, further negotiations require assistance from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service as the parties endeavor to avoid invoking the Federal Services Impasse Panel for a final decision on the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement and return to office plan. The uncertainty surrounding the plans for return to office and the potential for expanded telework and/or workplace flexibilities makes it more difficult to plan for future human capital management solutions. Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we plan to evaluate the agencys workplace safety protocols developed in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, including the COVID 19 workplace safety plan and related measures, such as those established pursuant to OMB Memorandum M 21 15, Executive Order 13991, and other applicable guidance. We also will complete a review of the agencys upward mobility program. Furthermore, we will monitor the SECs progress in addressing prior open audit recommendations related to human capital management. To assess the SECs efforts to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and opportunity, we will complete an ongoing audit of the agencys small business contracting. We will also assess the operations and controls over the agencys equal employment opportunity program. 26",3

Its a good thing this particular rule was reopened for comments due to a \malfunction\ that caused massive amounts of negative public sentiment to disappear from the internet. This is just another piece of circumstantial evidence that suggests the SEC is complicit in the criminality of Wall St. Lack of regulation, lack of enforcement, will fine famous people more than the ill gotten gains but not hedge funds, allowing participants dozens of violations to continue operating and now losing all the comments that wanted the rules rewritten.

Like a fool, I trusted that submitting it would keep it backed up. What kind of agency doesnt write backups of their data? Hiring a tech team to teach the SEC how to compress data and store it to a backup should be the top priority of the SEC. Additionally, creation of a publicly accessible database with transparency for all items is the only option for the SEC to restore the publics trust. We are all entering the information age and opaque data has no place in the future.",1

Tel Aviv, Israel 6789124 (972) 523 241 836 contact@Kovrr.com www.kovrr.com Ms. Vanessa Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 Date: October 25, 2022 Ms. Countryman, Yakir Golan, on behalf of Kovrr, submits this letter in response to the request for public comments by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) on the proposed rulemaking, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, (Proposed Rule) as announced by the Commission on March 9, 2022. As a precursor, Kovrr is a cyber risk quantiﬁcation company that models ﬁnancial exposure due to cyber events. We have long standing ties in the cyber insurance industry and are advised by Chief Information Security Oﬃcers of some of the largest U.S. enterprises. The company was founded with the intention of helping information security personnel communicate cyber risk to corporate directors, risk professionals, and other stakeholders within organizations that may not have the in depth knowledge of cybersecurity, as an operational risk. Our most recent interactions with large organizations have shown that cyber risk is often approached as an individual silo and therefore the risk is assessed from a perspective that does not align to properly setting a holistic cyber risk management strategy. We fully support the Commissions objective to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies. The following is a set of answers to the questions posed: Request for comment #17: Pursuant to section (2), describe its policies and procedures, if any, for the identiﬁcation and management of risks from cybersecurity threats, including whether the registrant considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, ﬁnancial planning, and capital allocation, we strongly recommend adding a ﬁnancial quantiﬁcation reporting aspect to the policies and procedures. In order for cyber risk to be considered in business strategy, ﬁnancial planning, and capital allocation, cyber risk must have a ﬁnancial exposure in monetary terms attached to the risk. Pursuant to section (3), require disclosure about the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk, managements role in assessing and managing such risk, managements cybersecurity expertise, and managements role in implementing the registrants cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies. We fully support this initiative, however, there is a major gap in managements ability to understand the cyber risk on a technical level and therefore the only way for them to be able to take responsibility, is if they have an understanding of how the cybersecurity risk can aﬀect the ﬁnancial and operational aspects of the business. Again, we propose a ﬁnancial quantiﬁcation aspect to the current requirements in order to make this responsibility ethically possible. We see cyber risk as an imminent threat to the largest corporations in the United States today and a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risk for shareholders. It is therefore our recommendation that the reporting follows reporting related to other operational risks and assigns monetary values for risks for full transparency to all those involved. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our recommendations and are conﬁdent that the proposal will lead to better market wide cybersecurity posture, practices, and management.

Washington, DC 20549 File No. S7 09 22, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Dear Ms. Countryman,  The proposal by Securities and Exchange Commission to have a standard regarding cybersecurity incident reporting is a welcome addition to the current landscape, bringing more security and establishing a healthier environment for investors and the whole market.  In this letter I would like to share my personal point of view of some of the proposed rules and recommended amends.  Time period to report Instead of a flat four days, I believe a more elaborated approach: cybersecurity incidents have different impacts, and those impacts should be taken in consideration when determining in how time they should be reported. By leveraging CISAs National Cyber Incident Scoring System (available at: https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/CISA National Cyber Incident Scoring System) companies would categorize their cybersecurity risks in 6 different priorities. Priorities basically measure how much a given incident would jeopardize national security and correlated assets. So, for example, am Emergency (black) category cybersecurity incident should require immediate notification in less than 1 hour, since it poses imminent threat to the lives of U.S. persons, while a Low (Green) incident may have a more flexible timeline of 30 days. Although some companies and organizations are advocating for not disclosing incidents while they are still not mitigated, it is important to notice in todays world such incidents are quickly discovered by mass media companies and rapidly becomes global news, so it is fair and important for investors to be aware of such incidents and the extension of their damage as soon as possible.  Managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks Expertise must be demonstrated with material evidence, like publicly published resume demonstrating years of experience of current board executive responsible for cybersecurity, as well as cybersecurity certifications by executives (using a baseline like for example DoD Approved 8570 Baseline Certifications, available at: https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod approved 8570 baseline certifications/).  Another recommended amend would be the disclosure of total cybersecurity investments in the Annual Reports, so investors may assess if the investments to protect cyber assets are proportional and reasonable for the company business and size. 10 K Disclosures  An important amend I recommend is the company must be explicit if Personal Identifiable Information (PII) was stolen, altered, accessed, or used, and how many individuals were impacted by such incident. Thank you for your consideration and Im available for any questions.

Many of our States submitted comments on two of the affected rules: Enhanced Disclosures by Certain Investment Advisers and Investment Companies about Environmental, Social, and Governance Investment Practices, Release Nos. 33 11068, 34 94985, IA 6034, IC 34594 (June 17, 2022); and The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, Release Nos. 33 11042, 34 94478 (Apr. 11, 2022). On October 7, 2022, the SEC provided notice that, due to failed technology, comments to 12 different rulemaking proposals/comment periods over a 15 month period may not have been received and logged. It proposes to provide 14 days following publication of the reopening release in the Federal Register for anyone to resubmit their comments. The SEC notice instructs any person who submitted a comment to go to the SEC.gov website, research whether your comment is there, and resubmit if it is not. This short time period is insufficient to ensure that hundreds or perhaps thousands of affected entities are aware of the government glitch and know to properly respond.  Letter from 18 Attorneys General to the Securities and Exchange Commission October 24, 2022 Page 2 The public needs significant, additional time to comment on these rules. Thats especially true with the two climate related rules referenced above, which seek to usher in a market transformation. Those proposed rules—in effect if not in form— seek to reorder public companies priorities from maximizing shareholder returns to improving climate reputation. To achieve these goals, the Commissions proposed rules—which sweep far beyond its traditional area of expertise or statutory authority—would compel public companies to gather, create, and disclose a crushing amount of information. Such disclosures far exceed any information investors reasonably need. And in reality, they would empower the Commission to regulate disfavored industries into oblivion. These concerns are even more pressing because the proposed rules rest on thin legal ice: they exceed the Commissions statutory authority, violate First Amendment protections against compelled speech, and are arbitrary and capricious. Because these rules impose burdensome requirements on regulated companies and will ultimately harm investors and all Americans, the SEC should extend the timeframe for public comment in a meaningful—not perfunctory—way, to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment on these rules.

I agree with Chair Genslers view that [c]ompanies and investors alike would benefit if this information were required in a consistent, comparable, and decision useful manner. A more consistent manner would be the use of numbers, which are universally understood. A reasonable person should be able to assess and benchmark IT expenses by company and industry. Itemzied IT expenses in a companys Form 10 K and Form 10 Q should be the reference point that assists shareholders in establishing some form of benchmarking when determining a companys correct allocation of resources for cyber security, risk management, strategy and governance.  Cyber is an emerging risk and clouded in buzz words that hinder, obfuscate and confuse 99% of the population. Many find it difficult to navigate unfamiliar landscape and to demystify contemporary terms such as malware, botnet, cloud, VPN, DDoS, and brute force attack. It would be fair to say that most dont speak or understand cyber language and never will. So why not speak in numbers?  Mandatory reporting of IT expenses in Forms 10 K and 10 Q will have an immediate and beneficial effect; particularly for those considering to invest in the financial services industry, which is reliant on complex IT systems and networks to operate its businesses and secure clients personal information. How much a company allocates and spends on its own IT can sometimes be revealing.  Mandatory reporting of IT expenses will also serve as a form of accountability for companies that claim to be experts in risk management and profit heavily from the sale of cyber policies, such as the insurance broking industry. According to Marshs Q1, 2022 investor day presentation, global cyber premiums are expected to grow at around 24% compound annual growth rate to $18 billion through to 20251. Therefore, Marsh the worlds largest insurance broker should lead the industry and itemize its own IT expenses. If youre selling cyber, then you should be itemizing your IT expenses for the purpose of benchmarking and the collection of data and analytics. Aon has itemized its IT expenses since 2015, but Marsh still does not. This inconsistency needs to change. Refer below examples. 1 Marsh McLennan Investor Day Presentation, Results for the First Quarter 2022 www.marshmclennan.com 2 Aons Annual Accounts  Information Technology (IT) expense is itemized  Aon has itemized its IT expense since 2015.

All insurance brokers should be forced to itemize their IT expense as they profit heavily from the sale of cyber policies and commission.

Washington, DC 20549  Re:  File No. S7 09 22, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC1 (Nasdaq) appreciates the opportunity to comment on a recent proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) to require current reporting of material cybersecurity incidents to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Proposal).2 Nasdaq supports the Proposals goals to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity and agrees that cybersecurity threats pose an ongoing and escalating risk to public companies, investors, and market participants. Requiring public companies to disclose uniform information about cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices would provide investors with comparable information to assess how public companies manage cybersecurity risk, thereby promoting transparency and consistency. Nasdaq believes that investors, issuers and other market participants will benefit from healthy capital markets that promote trust and transparency. However, as Nasdaq considered the Proposal in our role as a national securities exchange serving as a listing venue, the Proposal raised some concerns for our listed companies. We received valuable feedback from our issuer community, which includes companies of various  1  The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC is registered as a national securities exchange and is wholly owned by Nasdaq, Inc. 2  See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 94382 (March 9, 2022), 87 FR 16590 (March 23, 2022) (File No. S7 05 22) (Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure). 2 sizes and market capitalizations, about issues that are important to them. Nasdaq addresses below certain concerns that are raised by this Proposal for those listed companies. Time Period For 8 K Disclosure of Cybersecurity Information Is Too Short Nasdaq received feedback from listed companies concerning the requirement to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The feedback indicated that the four business day timeframe (1) may interfere with a public companys primary obligation to remediate a cybersecurity intrusion; and (2) is an exceptionally short time period in which to understand the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach as well as its potential impact.  Once a breach of a companys information systems has been discovered, it is paramount for a company to understand the scope and nature of the cybersecurity incident and immediately commence remediation efforts to limit the amount of damage that such an incident may cause.  Time is of the essence for a company dealing with a cybersecurity incident. However, the requirements of this Proposal, including the determination of materiality itself, could distract key employees and management away from remediation efforts. In these situations, public companies should be permitted to prioritize first on protecting the companys information systems and averting further damage over other priorities. The feedback we received is that greater flexibility should be provided to public companies with respect to the timeframe to disclose a cybersecurity incident so as not to divert critical efforts away from remediation efforts.  The discovery of a potential breach of a companys information systems would trigger a series of necessary actions to arrive at a determination that a breach was material including, but not limited to, an internal investigation, extensive communication with and oversight from senior management, and the board of directors, together with communication with external parties (outside counsel, advisors, expert consultants and regulators). The four business day timeframe may not provide public companies with adequate time to investigate and formulate next steps much less prepare a fulsome and thorough disclosure and as a result, may hinder a companys investigation into a breach, potentially precluding a deliberate and systematic investigation, which could result in incorrect or incomplete conclusions being drawn early on and being disclosed within the Form 8 K. We believe disclosures that are premature, and potentially incomplete or ultimately misleading, do not further investor protection and do not promote well functioning orderly and efficient markets. Rather, incomplete or misleading disclosures have the potential to exacerbate the original harm imposed by a bad actor. Hasty disclosures forced by the need to comply with the four business day timeframe could impair both public companies and investors if investments are made based on piece meal information. Nasdaq acknowledges that in some cases more expeditious disclosure may be justified and requests the Commission consider providing some flexibility in the timing of the disclosure to allow public companies the necessary time to prepare and file more informed disclosures. Finally, public companies bear risk in making materiality determinations in a timely manner where facts and circumstances are fluid, as is the case with cybersecurity incidents.  When a material cybersecurity incident is disclosed, there will likely follow questions regarding the companys actions, including the timing of disclosure and materiality determination itself, which could further complicate, and even potentially alter, the companys investigations, 3 remediations and communications with key stakeholders. In addition, actions taken with best intentions and with information available at the time could, in hindsight, be considered mistakes.  Given this risk, Nasdaq suggests the Commission grant a safe harbor to public companies with respect to the timing of reporting and determination of materiality made in good faith. Such protection would allow public companies to conduct methodical investigations and remediations, as well as make disclosures, without the fear of being second guessed. Smaller Reporting Companies Should be Permitted Additional Time to Comply  The Proposal would require public companies to disclose policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats, including, operational risk; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk.3 As a result, public companies would need to review and adopt expanded governance policies to meet the required disclosures. Also, because a cybersecurity incident refers to any information4 residing in a companys information systems, the Proposal would impact the manner in which a public company reviews and retains data over an unlimited time period since a public company would need to necessarily monitor all incidents, whether material or not. Further, in light of the Proposal, public companies may need to attract suitably qualified individuals with cybersecurity expertise. These additional requirements may disproportionately impact smaller reporting companies with fewer resources and, as such, Nasdaq believes that the Commission should provide a longer compliance period for smaller reporting companies.  In addition, while the proposed disclosures are important, the Commission should also consider the cumulative effects of the burdens placed on public companies when imposing new requirements. Specifically, the Commission should balance the information necessary to ensure investors are kept informed against any burdens placed on public companies based on their size.  Without a proper balance, additional burdens may have the unintended impact of making public capital markets a less attractive alternative for companies that consider offering their securities to the public.  Delayed Reporting Should be Permitted Where An Investigation is Ongoing The Proposal does not provide for a reporting delay for ongoing investigations. If a potential breach was determined to be material, a public company would have concomitant obligations to communicate with customers, comply with statutory and/or regulatory obligations, and communicate with law enforcement within potentially the same four day time period to disclose a cybersecurity incident within the Form 8 K. The Proposal does not provide for a reporting delay for ongoing investigations, even when requested by law enforcement and otherwise permitted under state law and other federal laws. Disclosures of material incidents may serve to hamper an investigation where the scope of the intrusion may yet be unknown, which may strain collaboration with law enforcement. Worse, the obligation to disclose may reveal additional information to an unauthorized intruder who may still have access to the  3  See proposed Item 106(b).  4  See proposed Item 106(a).  4 companys information systems at the time the disclosure is made and potentially further harm the company.5 The Commission should strongly consider the conflicts raised by disclosure where an investigation is ongoing. 10 K Disclosures Should be Streamlined Requiring public companies to disclose policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks and governance, including board oversight, as well as managements role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing policies, procedures, and strategies within the Form 10 K would unnecessarily complicate the 10 K filing with information not specifically focused on business operations and financial performance. In 2020, the Commission adopted several amendments designed to modernize and simplify disclosure requirements pursuant to Regulation S K that apply to periodic reports, proxy statements and certain other public filings.6 These amendments have streamlined certain disclosure requirements, while also eliminating outdated or duplicative disclosures for reporting companies under Regulation S K and impacted other forms, among them the Form 10 K. The proposed cybersecurity disclosures7 could be viewed as counteracting the Commissions goal in 2020 to simplify and streamline disclosure requirements. If the Commission determines to require the 10 K disclosures, Nasdaq suggests offering public companies a choice to disclose cybersecurity policies and procedures, governance, and managements role and relevant expertise within either the Form 10 K or the proxy statement.  * * *  Nasdaq appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Commissions Proposal and applauds the Commissions actions to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding  5  New Item 1.05 would require disclosure of the following information about a material cybersecurity incident, to the extent the information is known at the time of the Form 8 K filing: (1) when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; (2) a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident; (3) whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose; (4) the effect of the incident on the registrants operations; and (5) whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. See Proposal at 16595.  6  See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89670 (August 26, 2020), 85 FR 63726 (October 8, 2020) (Modernization of Regulation S K Items 101, 103, and 105). 7  With this Proposal, public companies would be required to include, as part of their Form 10 K, disclosure of: (1) policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; (2) a cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks; and (3) managements role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies.

It is the believe of SM4RT Secure LLC that representation of a certified cybersecurity leader should have a presence on the board of directors. Breaches and cyber threats are increasing at an astronomical rate and it is the responsibility to act on and mitigate any risk that can affect shareholders. This includes the security posture of the company, potential incidents, and ongoing incidents. Unfortunately, the cybersecurity field is witnessing large turnover and high rates of quitting for non cybersecurity related jobs. This particular ruling could soften that blow as it would allow CISOs to report issues and have interested parties provide support. Currently, only 7% of CISOs report to the CEO.  With respect to reporting cybersecurity incidents, we find this somewhat problematic. We believe that the board should be made aware as soon as an incident has been identified and ways of risk mitigation have begun. We do not believe that reporting these incidents in Form 8 K is appropriate until the incident has been resolved and the risk is mitigated, aside from existing law. This is because attackers could utilize this transmitted data to further expose, 3012 Chimney Cove Cir, Brownsboro, AL 35741 | 256 508 1190 www.SM4RTSECURE.com breach, or otherwise do harm to the company, its board of directors, and more importantly its investors.

Should reporting still be desired, I would encourage the implementation of a 60 90 day window to allow for the incident to be resolved prior to reporting. This length of time would allow for scheduled downtime of critical systems, vendors to patch software holes that are not currently available, and other variables in a standard environment.  We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspectives on the proposed rule. We hope that this has provided some insight and we are looking forward to the outcome of this ruling.

We write to comment on the proposed rule of Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance (RSG), and Incident Disclosure (hereafter the proposal), specifically Items D and E related to disclosures of cybersecurity governance and directors cybersecurity expertise. We have conducted a study directly related to this proposed rule. Our study is summarized in an article titled, Why Corporate Boards Need More Cybersecurity Expertise, published in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on September 7 (online) and 9 (print), 2022, from which we excerpt below. Our full paper, on which the WSJ article is based, is attached to this letter. It is titled Inexpert Supervision: Field Evidence on Boards Oversight of Cybersecurity, and is currently under peer review at a leading accounting journal. Below we briefly highlight our study and findings. We conducted a qualitative, interview based field study with directors, chief information security officers (CISOs, or other similar security executives), and consultants that work with boards on cybersecurity of mid and large cap firms. We investigated how directors provide cybersecurity oversight and the role of expertise in determining its effectiveness. Overall, we found that most boards lack adequate understanding of cybersecurity, and this substantially affects the quality of their oversight (WSJ). Specific findings relevant to this proposal include (excerpts from our WSJ article in quotations): • [L]ack of expertise leads to superficial, check the box oversight. For example, board members may simply not give adequate attention to cybersecurity, since directors naturally focus on things they know best. They may ask the CISO naive or off the shelf questions that dont cut to the heart of the companys cybersecurity risks. • When answers are provided, directors may not understand them, or be able to detect rosy framing or ask follow up questions to probe if the CISO or their program needs a shift in direction. • [B]oards with low expertise tend to overrely on CISOs. Many CISOs must regularly educate the board about cybersecurity issues before they can be meaningfully discussed. [… this] limits what the CISO can report in the brief time allotted in board meetings. Worse, it can make the board members dependent on the CISO for their understanding of the issues at hand.  • [M]any CISOs actively coach the board about what information the board should receive, what questions the board should ask, and what the target metrics for cybersecurity should be. This circular oversight, where the subjects of oversight (the CISOs) determine how they are overseen, lacks independence and is clearly problematic. • [M]ost CISOs we interviewed readily conceded that, given boards lack of cybersecurity expertise, filtering out thorny issues in reports to the board is a temptation for them or their peers. In comparison, directors we spoke with largely said that CISOs wouldnt filter their reports this way, or that if they did, directors could detect their coverup attempts. • Benefits of directors with cybersecurity expertise include that they can talk with the CISO to fully understand issues and challenge the CISOs cybersecurity programs when needed. They can also be a tremendous asset to the CISO by acting as a go between with the board and by lending political capital to the CISOs requests to the C suite for resources and needed organizational changes. • [T]rue expertise—such as that gained through direct, hands on experience managing cybersecurity—provides the most benefits. However, even modest investments in a boards expertise, such as cybersecurity training, can pay substantial dividends. • Not all of our participants believe that boards need cybersecurity expertise as a director skill. Concerns include that directors with cybersecurity expertise may have little other value to the board, that other directors may over rely on the director with expertise, or that an expert director is more likely to micromanage the CISO. • Despite these concerns, the overall consensus was that expertise enables directors to provide proactive, value added oversight of cybersecurity risk that wouldnt be possible without it.  Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of boards in cybersecurity oversight, and we agree that rules like S7 09 22 that the SEC is proposing will improve transparency of cybersecurity governance. We refer you to both our WSJ and full academic articles. We hope that this timely study provides useful insights to the Commission as it weighs the need for further disclosures related to director cybersecurity expertise and the boards role in cybersecurity risk oversight.

Inexpert Supervision:  Field Evidence on Boards Oversight of Cybersecurity   Abstract We conduct an interview based field study to investigate how directors provide cybersecurity oversight and the role of expertise in determining its effectiveness. Our interviews suggest that directors cybersecurity expertise is an important determinant of oversight effectiveness, primarily through increasing directors attention to cybersecurity issues and enabling them to ask incisive questions of management. Moreover, in the absence of board expertise, directors rely heavily on chief information security officers (CISOs) to coach them on cybersecurity concepts, third party validation, and even the process of cybersecurity oversight itself. Thus, a lack of board expertise can result in circular governance between the board and management, whereby the terms of oversight are largely dictated by the supposed subjects of that oversight. Further, our CISO participants believe their peers filter reports to the board to obfuscate potentially damaging information, and that boards lacking cybersecurity expertise are not able to detect such filtering.

The companies that handle it best will have relevant expertise in the boardroom…. SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, 2018  [M]ost boards are simply completely incapable of overseeing cyber risk. Its just so far outside of their experience and their expertise that all they can do is assess the credibility of the executives that are put in front of them.  Former NASDAQ Board Director I. INTRODUCTION Boards of directors have a fiduciary duty to oversee firms management of material risks, which increasingly include risks related to cybersecurity.1 Reflecting an expectation for boards oversight, the SEC states that firms should disclose details about the boards role in overseeing cybersecurity to enable investors to assess how a board of directors is discharging its risk oversight responsibility in this increasingly important area (SEC 2018, 18). While regulators and investors emphasize that boards should provide substantive cybersecurity oversight (e.g., Aguilar 2014; CII 2016), cybersecurity may pose unique oversight challenges to boards due to their relative unfamiliarity with the subject matter, its technical nature, and its recent emergence as a key board responsibility. Proficiency in cybersecurity is not a central qualification for most board members (Larcker, Reiss, and Tayan 2017). Moreover, specific responsibility for cybersecurity oversight is typically delegated to the audit committee (EY 2020), which is primarily focused on financial reporting. Board directors themselves have expressed reservations about boards ability to adequately oversee cybersecurity (PwC 2019; Cheng, Groysberg, Healy, and Vijayaraghavan 2021). For example, a survey of corporate directors suggests that 52 percent of public company directors are  1 The SEC defines cybersecurity as The body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, systems, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access (SEC 2011).   2  not confident that they sufficiently understand cyber risks to provide effective cyber risk oversight and 42 percent do not believe their boards collectively know enough about cyber risk to provide effective oversight (National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) 2018).  To provide large sample evidence of the cybersecurity gap among public company boards, we investigate the prevalence of cybersecurity among director skill sets disclosed in proxy statements. Regulation S K requires that firms disclose information about directors particular areas of expertise or other relevant qualifications (Item 401(e) of Regulation S K). We examine 1,000 proxy statements from a random sample of the Russell 3,000 and find that just under 15 percent of firms disclose that any of their directors had cybersecurity expertise. The general scarcity of cybersecurity expertise2 at the board level raises the following important research questions: (1) How do directors provide cybersecurity oversight? and (2) How does director expertise influence the effectiveness of cybersecurity oversight?  To investigate these questions, we perform a qualitative field study using methods well suited to gaining in depth insight into boards monitoring activities and decision making (Yin 2018) and that have been used in recent accounting research (e.g., Bills, Hayne and Stein. 2018; Hayne and Vance 2019; Dodgson, Agoglia, Bennet and Cohen 2020).3 We conduct 30 interviews with board directors and cybersecurity executives who interface with boards, incorporating the perspectives of those who conduct oversight and those who are overseen. We also interview consultants who support boards governance of cybersecurity to provide an outside view of the board management relationship in cybersecurity oversight. We follow guidance on positivist field  2 Expertise and experience are closely related, although expertise implies domain specific knowledge from both experience and ability (Bonner and Lewis 1990). Therefore, we generally use the term expertise because it more precisely refers to an individuals capability. We recognize that director cybersecurity expertise is relative and falls on a continuum. For ease of exposition, in this paper we refer to cybersecurity expertise simply as expertise. 3 Approval for this research using human subjects was granted by the institution at which the research took place.   3  research (Malsch and Salterio 2016), and draw on theory to help explain our field observations. While agency theory predicts that boards provide substantive and independent oversight of management (Fama 1980), self efficacy theory (Bandura 1982, 2001), which addresses the socio behavioral effects of expertise, suggests that a lack of expertise may lead to insufficient attention to cybersecurity issues, as well as to excessive reliance on management.  Our interviews suggest that the level of individual directors cybersecurity expertise is an important determinant of the effectiveness of board oversight. Consistent with self efficacy theory, cybersecurity expertise influences the attention given by boards to cybersecurity issues; when boards lack directors with cybersecurity expertise, they are less likely to substantively address cybersecurity during board meetings. Participants described that, in the absence of expert directors, boards may adopt a compliance attitude to check a box by receiving cybersecurity reports without significantly engaging with cybersecurity executives. In addition, our interviewees shared that cybersecurity expertise affects the quantity, quality, and depth of the questions that directors ask cybersecurity executives as well as their ability to meaningfully respond to answers received. We find that when inexpert boards do engage with cybersecurity executives, they often ask superficial questions (such as How are we doing?) or reactive questions (such as Could that happen to us? in response to a cyber incident in the media). Further, consistent with self efficacy theory, we find a lack of cybersecurity expertise leads boards to rely heavily on the chief information security officer (CISO) to coach them on cybersecurity concepts, risks, program objectives, and even the process of cybersecurity oversight itself.4 This reliance on management inhibits the boards ability to provide an independent assessment of cybersecurity risk or to provide incremental value in their oversight. In contrast to  4 For ease of exposition, we refer to senior executives with direct responsibility over cybersecurity collectively as CISOs.   4  perspectives from agency theory, which emphasizes conflicts between boards and managers and the need for the former to independently verify the latters efforts (Fama 1980), we find that many directors downplay the potential for conflict but rather emphasize that the board and managers are part of the same team. However, our CISO participants were more forthcoming about potential conflicts, such as a CISO reporting a more favorable view of their performance and the firms overall cybersecurity position to the detriment of the firm. In particular, many CISOs believe that filtering negative aspects from reports is a common practice. Moreover, CISOs believe that boards lacking cybersecurity expertise are not able to detect such filtering. While specific responsibility for cybersecurity is typically delegated to the audit committee, interviewees indicate that one or two directors (not necessarily a member of the delegated committee) may organically volunteer to take on added oversight responsibilities beyond their formal role. Such initiative is based on a directors personal interest or their having more expertise in cybersecurity relative to peers on the board. These voluntary activities include engaging with the CISO outside of regular board meetings, acting as an intermediary between the CEO and the CISO, advocating for increased budgetary spending on cybersecurity, and previewing the CISOs report before it is presented to the full board. Thus, our findings indicate that substantive oversight can be organic and ad hoc rather than planned and assured through formal processes.  Although interviewees were unanimous in recognizing benefits of expertise in improving oversight, they did not uniformly perceive a need to appoint a bona fide cybersecurity expert to the board. Some participants expressed the view that general business and risk management experience were sufficient. In contrast, others strongly called for directors with genuine cybersecurity expertise and argued that a lack of expertise potentially exposes firms to significant risk. In terms of what qualifies a director as having relevant expertise, our interviewees shared   5  that direct experience working in or overseeing a cybersecurity function is necessary, whereas serving on a cybersecurity focused committee or receiving short training or director focused cyber certification (although beneficial) is insufficient.  This paper makes several contributions. We provide field evidence for the influence of director expertise on boards attention and ability to perform their monitoring function. In doing so, we answer the call for research on the challenges that boards face in conducting oversight and the board characteristics and activities that lead to differential oversight effectiveness (Cheng et al. 2021). Although our focus is on boards oversight of cybersecurity, we contribute to the broader corporate governance literature examining the influence of directors subject matter expertise on related outcomes (e.g., McDaniel, Martin, and Maines 2002; Cohen, Hoitash, Krishnamoorthy, and Wright 2014; Agrawal and Chadha 2005; Fich and Shivdasani 2007; Xie, Davidson, and DaDalt 2003; Abbott, Parker, and Peters 2004; Baugh, Hallman, and Kachelmeier 2021). We complement these archival studies by opening the black box of board oversight and providing rich narrative examples of how directors priorities and monitoring activities differ based on expertise.  Our study has implications for the growing body of research in accounting and related fields on the antecedents and effects of cybersecurity incidents (Banker and Feng 2019; Huang and Wang 2021). We provide field evidence that, in the absence of expertise, boards may rely excessively on management such that the terms of oversight (e.g., reporting content, objectives, and performance metrics) are largely dictated by the executives who are supposed to be the subjects of that oversight. Such circular governance appears unlikely to effectively mitigate agency conflicts and potentially exposes firms to an increased risk of cybersecurity failures. Accordingly, we contribute to the debate on whether cybersecurity expertise is needed at the board level (Larcker et al. 2017;   6  Ferracone 2019), and we expect that our findings will provide useful inputs into regulator and market participants board composition decisions relative to cybersecurity expertise. More broadly, an implication of our findings is that boards without sufficient domain specific expertise are unlikely to fulfill the monitoring role emphasized in the agency based perspective of corporate governance. We also contribute to the literature on the disclosure of cybersecurity issues (Amir, Levi, and Livne 2018; Ashraf 2021). In its recent guidance, the SEC specifically stated that the development of effective disclosure controls and procedures is best achieved when a companys directors … are informed about the cybersecurity risks and incidents that the company has faced or is likely to face (SEC 2018 p. 4, emphasis added). Further, cybersecurity risk governance and disclosure continue to be a high priority for SEC rulemaking (SEC 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2021d). Our evidence suggests that, without expertise, the board is less likely to be meaningfully informed about cybersecurity risks; hence, related disclosures may be less informative to market participants.  Finally, we shed light on what constitutes expertise in the context of boards responsibility in overseeing cyber risk. In the U.S., Congress is currently considering legislation requiring firms to disclose whether they have a board member with cybersecurity expertise (S.808 2021). The language of this bill mirrors that of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX), which requires firms to disclose the presence or absence of a financial expert on the board (U.S. Congress 2002). As was the case with defining financial expertise for SOX purposes (SEC 2003), what it means for a board member to be an expert in the cybersecurity domain is likely to be a controversial issue. We contribute by providing field evidence for what directors, executives, and consultants believe is needed in terms of cybersecurity expertise on the board.   7  II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED THEORY Background Cybersecurity incidents are increasingly prevalent and cause trillions of dollars in estimated losses annually (Fox 2021). Negative consequences of cybersecurity incidents include interruptions to operations, reputational costs, worse loan terms, and loss of firm market value (Huang and Wang 2021; Kamiya, Kang, Kim, Milidonis, and Stulz 2021; Tidy 2021; Tunggal 2021). Consequently, cybersecurity risk management is increasingly viewed as critical to firms success (Doan 2019; KPMG 2021), with firms spending in excess of $150 billion annually on cybersecurity, a figure projected to increase to well over $200 billion by 2025 (Gartner 2021).5 However, experts believe these financial investments are often in the wrong security initiatives, underscoring the need for boards to oversee cybersecurity investments to ensure that they provide value to shareholders (Morgan 2019; ISA and NACD 2020) . Reflecting these trends and concerns, there have been numerous calls for board level oversight of cybersecurity risk. For example, the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) states that [e]ffective cybersecurity risk management starts with the board (CII 2016, 2), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asserts that data security begins with the Board of Directors, not the IT Department (FTC 2021). Moreover, oversight of cybersecurity has been a point of emphasis for the SEC, with Chairman Robert Jackson calling the rising cyber threat the most pressing issue in corporate governance today (Jackson 2018) and Chairman Luis Aguilar cautioning that boards that choose to ignore, or minimize, the importance of cybersecurity oversight responsibility, do so at their own peril (Aguilar 2014). Accordingly, the SEC has issued guidance that boards should explain in the proxy statement (DEF 14A) their role in overseeing the management of  5 A recent survey by RBC Global Asset Management found cybersecurity to be institutional investors top concern among environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues (RBC 2019).  8  cybersecurity risk and how they engag[e] with management on cybersecurity issues (SEC 2018, p. 18), and cybersecurity risk governance continues to be a high priority for SEC rulemaking (SEC 2021a).  Regulators and legislators increasingly require boards to oversee cybersecurity. In 2001, in accordance with the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), the U.S. Treasurys Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued cybersecurity standards for banks, requiring boards to [o]versee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the banks information security program… and to receive related cybersecurity reports from management at least annually (66 FR 8633). Notably, the OCC specifically cited the failure of Capital Ones board to provide effective cybersecurity oversight as a key reason for levying an $80 million fine in connection with Capital Ones 2019 data breach (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2020). The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has issued rules for financial services firms operating in New York to require boards to receive reports from cybersecurity management at least annually (s 500.4(b) 2017) . This same regulation has since become law in 13 states for licensed insurance companies (Blosfield 2021) and has been proposed by the FTC in its amendments to the Safeguards Rule governing financial institutions under the GLBA (FTC 2019). Further, it is likely that regulators of other industries will adopt rules such as those of the OCC and NYDFS in the future (PwC 2021).  Despite the urgency of effective cybersecurity programs and the expectations for directors to oversee them (SEC 2018), survey evidence suggests that directors do not have sufficient expertise with which to provide adequate oversight of cybersecurity risk (NACD 2018; PwC 2019). For example, in their survey of 577 U.S. public company directors, Cheng et al. (2021) find that directors perceive cybersecurity to have the lowest level of board effectiveness among the 19   9  responsibility areas considered, and the authors suggest that the low effectiveness in this area is due to limited board level experience or expertise.  Theoretical lenses We follow Malsch and Salterios (2016) suggestions for the use of theory in positivist field research. First, we use investors and regulators expectations and standards discussed above as normative theory (Malsch and Salterio, 2016, 5), which serves as a baseline against which practices observed in the field can be evaluated. Second, we use theories from related disciplines to form expectations against which to compare our findings. Agency theory (e.g., Jensen and Meckling 1976; Fama and Jensen 1983; Eisenhardt 1989) is the dominant lens through which corporate governance is viewed in the accounting and finance literatures (Beasley, Carcello, Hermanson, and Neal 2009), particularly as it relates to boards monitoring (as opposed to advising) role.6 We therefore use an agency perspective as a starting point from which to develop expectations for how boards conduct cybersecurity oversight. We also incorporate perspectives from self efficacy theory to generate expectations for how cybersecurity expertise influences oversight.  Agency Theory Perspective Under an agency perspective, top managers may not act in the best interests of shareholders due to insufficient ability or conflicting preferences (or both). For example, a CISO may prefer to shirk rather than incur personal cost from effort or may select inefficient cybersecurity investments representing pet projects. A fundamental tenet of agency theory is that firms seek to mitigate agency costs by separating decision management from decision control, and the board of directors  6 Broadly, boards of directors play both a monitoring and an advising role (e.g., Faleye, Hoitash, and Hoitash 2011), and agency theory and resource dependence theory have traditionally served as the primary lens for the former and latter, respectively (Hillman and Dalziel 2003). While acknowledging directors advising role, we focus in this paper on monitoring, consistent with the SECs guidance emphasizing boards cybersecurity oversight responsibilities.   10  serves as the apex of the decision control systems (Fama and Jensen 1983, 323). Due to the potential for conflicts (and resulting costs) between shareholders and managers, agency theory suggests that the boards most important role is to scrutinize the highest decision makers within the firm (Fama 1980, 294). Hence, agency theory predicts that directors will be diligent monitors of material firm risks, including cybersecurity risks.  Domain specific expertise is increasingly recognized as important for boards to fulfill their intended monitoring role (Hillman and Dalziel 2003; Hambrick, Misangyi, and Park 2015). The role of a boards financial expertise in particular has generated significant academic attention following the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which requires firms to disclose whether their audit committee has a financial expert. Studies show that financial expertise is positively associated with financial reporting quality and related outcomes (McDaniel et al. 2002; Xie et al. 2003; Bédard, Chtourou, and Courteau 2004; Abbott et al. 2004; Agrawal and Chadha 2005; Krishnan 2005; Goh 2009; Hoitash, Hoitash, and Bedard 2009; Lisic, Myers, Seidel, and Zhou 2019), and that market participants react favorably when a financial expert is appointed to the audit committee (DeFond, Hann, and Xuesong 2005). Collectively, these studies suggest that financial expertise enhances the extent to which boards fulfill their oversight responsibilities. As with financial reporting, cybersecurity is a technical domain, and thus, boards oversight of a firms cybersecurity program may similarly benefit from (or even necessitate) domain specific expertise. The agency perspective of corporate governance generally assumes the board possesses sufficient expertise to provide an independent7 check on management (e.g., Fama and Jensen  7 While the governance implications of director independence are well studied in the prior literature, much of this research focuses on structural independence, typically measured as whether directors have a primary employment relationship with the firm, or otherwise have preexisting relationships with the executive team (e.g., Weisbach 1988; Beasley 1996; Klein 2002; Chen et al. 2015). More fundamentally, however, independence relates to a directors ability to form their own assessment of the firms risks, programs, and performance apart from assessments as provided by the management team (Hambrick et al. 2015).   11  1983). In contrast, drawing on resource dependence theory, Hillman and Dalziel (2003) argue that boards vary in their expertise (and human capital more generally), which in turn explains variations in boards monitoring effectiveness. From a resource dependence perspective, when the board possesses sufficient domain expertise, we might expect vigilant, independent monitoring, as predicted by agency theory. However, when the board lacks such expertise, boards may not provide substantive oversight (Hambrick et al. 2015). While resource dependence theory highlights the importance of boards human capital, it does not provide specific insight into how oversight may be affected by low capital. Thus, below we draw on self efficacy theory to develop richer expectations for the effect of low cybersecurity expertise on boards oversight activities. Self Efficacy Theory Perspective Self efficacy refers to a set of beliefs about the ability to coordinate skills and abilities to attain desired goals in particular domains and circumstances (Maddux and Kleiman 2020, 3). While individuals may possess generalized self efficacy, domain specific efficacy is more predictive of behavior in specific circumstances (Bandura 1997; Maddux and Kleiman 2020). Further, the most potent and salient source of self efficacy beliefs is prior experience and performance in a task domain (Agarwal, Sambamurthy, and Stair, 2000, 419). Thus, we expect that directors with more cybersecurity expertise tend to have greater self efficacy in the cybersecurity domain. A central idea from self efficacy theory is that beliefs about capabilities are a primary basis of action (e.g., Bandura 1977; Bandura 1997; Maddux and Kleiman 2020), and prior research finds that self efficacy is associated with intrinsic interest, activity, effort, and task persistence (Gist 1987; Cervone and Peake 1986; Bouffard Bouchard 1990; Compeau and Higgins   12  1995).8 The effects of self efficacy may be particularly strong in a governance setting, because directors face time constraints and must choose the corporate issues on which to focus (Field, Lowry, and Mkrtchyan 2013). Consistent with this, Gendron and Bédard (2006), in the context of financial expertise, suggest that formal competencies may produce self confidence, which leads directors with expertise to engage more on issues related to their background. Based on the foregoing, in the absence of expertise we expect boards to devote insufficient time and attention to cybersecurity oversight activities. Self efficacy theory also suggests that low expertise can inhibit effective cybersecurity oversight due to an increased reliance on cybersecurity executives. As noted above, agency perspectives of governance emphasize conflicts with management and hence the need for independent scrutiny by the board. However, self efficacy theory predicts that individuals with low perceived efficacy (i.e., low domain expertise) are more likely to cede control to others who they perceive as having more efficacy, resulting in a vulnerable security that rests on the competencies and favors of others (Bandura, 1982, 142). This may result in low expertise directors excessively deferring to their board colleagues who they perceive as having more cybersecurity expertise. Another possibility is that the board (individually or collectively) will resort to proxy control (Bandura 1982, 1997, 2001; Xu, Teo, Tan, and Agarwal 2012), ceding their duty to establish an independent assessment of the firms cybersecurity program to management or cybersecurity consultants. In summary, investors and regulators have repeatedly emphasized their expectations that boards oversee cybersecurity risk. Agency theory suggests that boards will recognize the potential  8 In the accounting literature, self efficacy has been shown to be a determinant of appropriate audit system use (Dowling 2009) and auditor judgements (Iskandar, Sari, Mohd‐Sanusi, and Anugerah 2012). Self efficacy theory is widely used in information systems research (e.g., Yoo, Goo and Rao 2020).   13  for agency conflicts and endeavor to provide independent, substantive oversight to ensure that the firms cybersecurity program reflects shareholders interests. However, many boards lack cybersecurity expertise, which may reduce a boards ability to provide such oversight and may result in low attention to cybersecurity issues, or excessive reliance (in place of scrutiny) on management as predicted by self efficacy theory. Table 1 summarizes the theoretical perspectives we consider in this study. Given the current expertise gap in most firms, our primary aim is to understand how boards conduct cybersecurity oversight and how cybersecurity expertise influences the nature of their oversight.  III. METHOD We follow best practices for positivist, qualitative field study methods from recent accounting research to investigate our research questions (e.g., Malsch and Salterio 2016; Bills et al. 2018; Hayne and Vance 2019; Dodgson et al. 2020; Free, Trotman and Trotman 2021). We use a qualitative field study approach because it is well suited for examining how processes and contexts influence how individuals behave and make decisions, especially for a contemporary phenomenon (Myers 2009; Yin 2018). Thus, qualitative methods were required to open the black box of boards governance of cybersecurity, to understand how directors perform this fiduciary responsibility.  To explore possible themes, theories, and issues relevant to cybersecurity oversight, we reviewed SEC and PCAOB reports and guidance on cybersecurity oversight, regulatory cybersecurity roundtables, and practitioner and academic guidance (e.g., IIA 2010; SEC 2011; SEC 2018; PCAOB 2018; and NACD 2020). We also conducted preliminary interviews with professionals about the challenges boards face in their cybersecurity oversight. This initial field   14  work helped us to establish our theoretical lens for our study and to prepare an initial interview script (Yin 2018).9 Sampling Strategy We conducted 30 interviews with 27 individuals belonging to three groups of professionals: board directors (11 participants), cybersecurity executives (9 participants), and senior level consultants who advise boards on cybersecurity issues (7 participants).10 The three participant types allowed us to triangulate our findings by obtaining varied perspectives of the parties involved in boards oversight of cybersecurity (Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña 2020). Further, this sampling approach allowed us to compare and contrast responses across each group. In contrast to experimental and archival methods that make statistical inferences, our sample size was not determined by achieving a level of statistical power. Instead, we continued our snowball sampling process until the point at which novel insights were no longer obtained (i.e., we reached theoretical saturation; see, e.g., Morse 1995; Malsch and Salterio 2016).11  Our sampling approach yielded a participant group with diversity across a number of dimensions, as summarized in Table 2.12, 13 Panel A shows that, among the 11 directors, five had low, three had medium, and three had high cybersecurity expertise. For the board members  9 In developing our initial interview script, we solicited and incorporated feedback from multiple academics and professionals who specialize in cybersecurity.  10 Note that three participants belonged to more than one group. Also, three other participants were interviewed twice to further explore themes raised in the initial interview. 11 Our coding process (described below) overlapped with our sampling process (i.e., we coded interviews while continuing to recruit participants), which aided us in identifying theoretical saturation. For example, during coding each researcher independently identified themes raised in the interview, and then we compared and evaluated whether additional interviews produced new themes or insights. 12 We restricted our interviews to those affiliated with mid to large cap companies because we expect these organizations are more likely to have a developed cybersecurity function. 13 Two directors and three executive participants represent large private firms. Surprisingly, we did not find significant variation in the cybersecurity governance process between publicly and privately held firms. Specifically, for the participants who have experience with both public and private boards (Director 4, Director 5, Executive 5), we directly asked about the differences. We were told the differences, if any, were minimal, and interviewees indicated cybersecurity oversight in particular is similar.   15  we interviewed, all but two had delegated responsibility for cybersecurity as part of their membership of the audit committee or another committee tasked with overseeing cybersecurity in at least one of their companies.14 The mean (median) number of director positions held by our director participants was 3.1 (3). Panel B presents information regarding executive participants. While the executive titles varied, all participants were directly responsible for cybersecurity and reported to the board. The directors and executives represent both high and low technology industries. Panel C provides information on our consultant interviews. We interviewed senior level consultants across a range of firms that provide cybersecurity consulting services to boards, including large technology solutions firms, the Big 4, and specialized consulting firms.  Interviews At least two researchers participated in each of the 30 interviews, which were conducted by phone or video calls and lasted an average of 52 minutes. We audio recorded and professionally transcribed all but four of these interviews. A graduate research assistant then reviewed each transcript against the corresponding audio recording to ensure accuracy. For the four interviews in which participants preferred not to be recorded, one researcher or a graduate research assistant took careful notes while two researchers conducted the interviews. Prior to each interview, we reviewed the participants biographical information available from LinkedIn and any online biographies. For interviews with directors and cybersecurity executives, we also reviewed news articles, proxy statements, and annual reports relating to firms associated with the interviewees.  Before beginning each interview, we informed the interviewee that our objective was to understand how boards approach cybersecurity oversight. To encourage open and forthright responses, we also emphasized to them that their identities would be kept strictly confidential. At  14 We also interviewed board members without specific responsibility for cybersecurity because the SEC specifies that the board as a whole is responsible for cybersecurity (SEC 2018).   16  the start of the interview, we asked interviewees about their professional background to verify information we had collected about them and their company and to clarify their roles on the boards, or, in the case of cybersecurity executives and consultants, how they interface with the boards (Dodgson et al. 2020). We followed a semi structured approach, customizing each interview script to the interviewees position and background (see sample interview questions in Appendix A). Interviewees spoke freely and at length, with the researchers only interjecting to ask for clarification or to ask follow up questions to further explore new insights or emerging themes raised by the interviewees. After each interview, the researchers held a debriefing meeting to discuss the fit with our theoretical lens, emerging themes, and possible refinement of our script.  Data Analysis We analyzed our data in NVivo using an iterative process of coding (Saldaña 2013; Miles et al. 2020). In the first cycle of coding, a code start list was generated from emerging themes from early interviews, and all three researchers independently generated new codes based on three interviews to further develop the preliminary coding scheme (Miles et al. 2020). We did this through initial coding, a generative coding technique used to identify and label concepts that form the central ideas around a topic (Saldaña 2013). This initial coding resulted in many codes, which we then narrowed down based on thematic overlap to form our initial codebook with definitions. These codes broadly included dimensions such as 1) the cybersecurity governance process, 2) directors attitudes toward cybersecurity, 3) directors cybersecurity expertise, and 4) interactions between directors and cybersecurity executives.  Next, all three researchers independently coded each of the interviews. In this phase of the analysis, we continued to generate and discuss potential new codes (initial coding), and relationships among the codes were examined to identify themes. In doing so, we used   17  simultaneous coding or multiple codes for a single statement in cases where the data suggested more than one theme and especially relationships between codes (Saldaña 2013). After each interview was coded, each researcher independently wrote a memo of the main theoretical takeaways from the interview and of the new codes proposed. We then discussed major themes and codes of that interview.  Throughout the coding, we reviewed coding differences among researchers to refine the codebook definitions and to create pattern codes of emerging themes (i.e., second cycle coding, Miles et al. 2020). With a finalized codebook, two researchers independently coded each interview once again to obtain a Cohens kappa (κ) score as a measure of agreement among the researchers. Overall, we obtained a κ score of 0.63, indicating good agreement among the research team (Cohen 1960). We also used pattern matching to compare our categories and themes to conditions and mechanisms related to our theoretical lens, which provided new insights (Malsch and Salterio 2016; Yin 2018). We also looked for anomalous data that failed to conform to the expected patterns and emerging categories and themes and updated our themes and explanations accordingly (Miles et al. 2020). IV. FINDINGS Before proceeding with our qualitative findings, we first report results from an analysis of proxy statements for a random sample of 1,000 firms from the Russell 3000 Index to assess the scale of the cybersecurity expertise gap at the board level for U.S. listed firms. Specifically, we examine the prevalence of cybersecurity among directors disclosed skills and qualifications,   18  which firms are required to describe under Regulation S K.15 We find that only 14.7 percent of firms disclosed at least one director with cybersecurity or related skills and experience. In contrast, every firm disclosed at least one board member with financial or accounting skills. Additionally, only 13.2 percent of the firms referenced experience related to cybersecurity or privacy in the biographies of board members. This analysis reinforces the surveys cited above (e.g., NACD 2018; PwC 2019; Cheng et al. 2021) and provides large sample evidence of the cybersecurity expertise gap at the board level. Given the expectations of regulators and investors that boards oversee cybersecurity risk, this apparent expertise gap motivates our qualitative analysis of the role of expertise in cybersecurity oversight.  How Does Expertise Affect Boards Cybersecurity Oversight? In the following section, we describe our field study findings on how director expertise influences oversight activities and the resulting oversight effectiveness, with additional selections of supporting interview evidence presented in Table 3. The Influence of Expertise on Attention Throughout our interviews, directors acknowledged the boards oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risk and emphasized the importance of effective cybersecurity. At the same time, participants shared that the focus on cybersecurity varies across and within boards. At the low end of engagement, the board may passively receive reports from cybersecurity management. For example, a CISO described his/her limited role in board meetings as follows:  Every year so far, I have been asked to come on site for the board meeting. Then, they decided that there were other more important things to discuss, and so I was thanked for my time but taken off the agenda. . . .I never presented, I was always sent away. I dont even know how they understood [the report]. I just heard thank you second hand. (Executive 5)  15 We searched proxy statements from the 2020 proxy season for keywords security, privacy, cyber, CISO, and CSO in board skill matrices and director biographies.   19  Similarly, a consultant shared the limited focus on cybersecurity he/she had observed on some boards: [Some boards] arent very inquisitive. They dont really care. Theyd like to see some metrics, but the attention in the meeting is elsewhere (Consultant 3). Several participants shared that board attention to cybersecurity is motivated by and limited to compliance concerns (Consultant 1, Director 9, Consultant 3, Consultant 4). A director, commenting on the compliance driven approach he/she perceives from other boards, described it as, They had to get a presentation about it. Lets check that box (Director 9). A consultant explained, Their primary motive is compliance, or because their customers require them to do it. Were not at a point where theres this genuine, internally driven incentive to do cybersecurity risk management well (Consultant 4). This tendency toward a compliance orientation appears inconsistent with regulators expectations and agency theory that boards will provide substantive oversight. With less engaged boards, attention is often reactive, piqued by cybersecurity incidents. CISOs described receiving many more questions about cybersecurity after prominent reports of breaches in the business press. Such external cyber incidents serve as a wake up call (Director 5), wherein board members are then prompted to ask, Could that happen to us? (Director 3, Director 5). A consultant described how interest in cybersecurity can quickly change following an incident: They think of their briefing as compliance and an exercise, until they get hacked; and then of course, theyre very interested in the details (Consultant 3). In contrast, many interviewees indicated that cybersecurity expertise is an important determinant of increased attention to cybersecurity risk. For example, directors with more cybersecurity expertise feel more comfortable engaging with management on cybersecurity issues. A director suggested that board members will naturally give more focus to the areas related to their   20  backgrounds, explaining, I will always lean into the things that I know. As a director… Im drilling into things that I know a lot about (Director 7). Another director, noting that board meetings cover many topics for oversight, said, People who are comfortable with certain subjects kind of jump in at that time (Director 8). Similarly, after pointing out that cybersecurity is outside of the expertise of a typical director, another director told us, Its definitely human nature to spend a lot more time on things that youre more comfortable in. I think if you were to simply measure the amount of time boards spend talking about cyber risk compared to financial risk, youd find its a tiny fraction (Director 9). Thus, consistent with predictions from self efficacy theory, our findings suggest that expertise is an important determinant of cybersecurity oversight effectiveness because it determines how much attention is given to cybersecurity during board meetings.  How Expertise Influences the Quality of the Questions Asked Even for boards that take time during board meetings to engage with the CISO, the effectiveness of the questions varies with expertise. Table 4 presents interviewee provided examples of questions that directors pose, categorized as superficial or substantive. Questions are more likely to be basic (Executive 4) when directors have little expertise with cybersecurity. In contrast to the superficial questions posed by inexpert directors, respondents frequently shared that directors with more expertise are able to ask higher quality questions during board meetings. Many respondents stated that cybersecurity knowledge or domain expertise allows directors to ask better (Executive 4), good (Director 2, Executive 2, Director 5), intelligent (Executive 2, Consultant 3), tough (Executive 8), or the right (Consultant 1, Director 7, Executive 3, Director 8, Director 11, Consultant 7, Executive 8) questions. Several interviewees offered analogies to financial expertise. For example, Its no different from having a financial expert on   21  the board. If you have a financial expert on the board, they at least know what questions to ask the CFO to give themselves comfort that the books arent being cooked (Director 11).  A director with high cybersecurity expertise offered examples of probing, more sophisticated questions, and then noted that, You will not know to ask those questions if you havent come from that domain and seen the kind of (expletive) that happens when people get hacked (Director 11). The difference in question quality based on expertise levels was explained by a self described inexperienced director who referred to a colleague with more expertise: His questions just might be a little bit better because he knows where some of the stumps are underneath the water (Director 8). A consultant elaborated on how expertise levels result in different questions, with a specific example:  [A board member with cybersecurity expertise] will ask technical questions. Theyll be aware of things going on in the industry. And theyll say, what sort of CASB [Cloud Access Security Broker] do we have, and is it good enough? And the other members of the board are going to say, what the [expletive] is a CASB? So its a big difference. (Consultant 3)  A cybersecurity executive, noting the role of technical expertise in raising a directors ability to ask questions, suggested, Theyre going to have a completely different level of expertise and knowledge and are going to be much more thorough in asking probing questions (Consultant 5).  Relatedly, several respondents described a synergistic outcome from a board having a member with cybersecurity expertise, whereby the director with expertise is able to initiate a line of questioning that the inexpert directors would not have thought to ask, but once the conversation has been started, the other members can use their general business experience to weigh in on the topic and provide additional oversight. I would not characterize it as leaning on [the board expert] as much as feeding off of him and benefiting from his experience and input (Director 8). This director continued:  22  It actually prompts further discussion because if somebody asks a question that you hadnt thought of yet, that might lead you to think of a follow up question, and I think thats when the boards working at its best, is when the conversation gets started because of somebodys experience, and then that triggers additional questions. (Director 8) The foregoing examples clearly highlight the implicit assumption of agency theory that directors have sufficient expertise to provide substantive, independent oversight (Fama and Jensen 1983; Jensen 1993). From the above examples, expertise leads to higher question quality and more meaningful oversight. In cases where expertise is lacking, oversight is shallow and perfunctory, contrary to the expectation of agency theory. Expertise Influences How Answers Are Received Just as expertise enables directors to ask better questions, expertise similarly allows directors to understand the answers they receive from technical managers. CISOs may respond to a question at a technical level that many inexpert directors would not be able to understand or interpret, and thus be incapable of assessing the adequacy or the implications of the CISOs response. Reflecting on this problem, a consultant observed that board members without expertise may get lost during managements cybersecurity briefings. He explained: Frankly, CISOs and the typical person you find on those boards speak two different languages. The CISO speaks a systems engineering or computer science language that come out of a computer science or systems engineering degree. And the people typically on the boards are lawyers or MBAs. And they speak an entirely different language. So that frequently, a CISO can brief a board, and they all nod and thank him or her. And there will have been no communication because one is speaking and the other one doesnt understand. Thats a real critical problem. So, its important that you have someone on the board who actually speaks geek, who actually knows what is being said and can have a dialogue, and can ask questions. Because otherwise, its kind of a dialogue of the deaf. (Consultant 3) Further, respondents described that additional expertise is particularly important for enabling a director to ask valuable follow up questions. Just as a person learning a foreign language   23  can ask a simple question and not understand the response, so too can low expertise prevent the board from having a meaningful dialogue with the CISO. A consultant explained:  Its not the first question that you ask, because you can download the dummys guide to cybersecurity. Its the second, and third, and fourth, and fifth questions that go off of the branching logic, based on how the CISO is providing his or her updates. (Consultant 7) Our findings of the role of expertise in the quality and quantity of questions, and in attendant question driven dialogue, is consistent with directors with high self efficacy exhibiting stronger commitment and persistence in their cybersecurity oversight. The Relationship Between the Board and the CISO Lack of Expertise Requires Coaching by CISOs The participants with whom we spoke described CISOs providing a category of support activities to the board that we label coaching. These activities include educating the board about cybersecurity and conditioning them regarding the content of information they should receive in reports and what level of risk is acceptable.  Educating the board. Several of the CISOs we interviewed indicated that they view educating the board as an important part of their responsibilities to level set, get on the same page, and provide a common language relative to cybersecurity (Executive 3, Director 7, Executive 9). For example, one CISO observed:  When I first joined… in terms of grade level, there was an elementary level of understanding [of cybersecurity on the board]. I met with and talked with each [board member] independently to understand their level. I immediately gauged that some had some knowledge, while others had none. Through the years, part of my job is to educate them… I call this raising their cyber IQ. (Executive 4) CISOs described personally conducting Security 101 (Executive 6) training as part of their regular meetings with the board as well as meeting informally with board members to answer their questions about cybersecurity concepts and current events. Often, directors use the Q&A period   24  of the CISOs presentation to ask ‘educating themselves kind of questions (Executive 3), rather than questions specific to the state of the companys security program. Further, turnover on the board and time elapsed since the previous board meeting necessitates regular review of concepts previously taught. Current events, such as data breaches in the business press, are also frequently discussed, with directors seeking to learn the concepts involved and the implications for their organization. Even budgetary requests to purchase cybersecurity software or services often requires the CISO to instruct the board: Its not like in a lot of cases, if youre saying, look, we need new fire extinguishers. Everybody knows what fire extinguishers are, so you dont have to tell people what theyre for and why they would be needed. But if you say, I need a new piece of software to do data loss prevention or … mobile device management, now you may need to explain what that means, and why do you care, and what are the consequences. (Consultant 1)  Although presentations to the board by various corporate officers can often include educational elements, one CISO describe the difference with cybersecurity in this way: [Y]ou typically dont have to explain to members of the audit committee how a financial statement works. Thats just implied and understood that they are masters of that and have a tremendous depth of experience in how to look at that and ask the right questions related to it. And that in comparison, [cybersecurity is] a topic that everybodys trying to really figure out, What does it mean? (Executive 1) Conditioning the board. After providing a definition of cybersecurity, one CISO was asked whether the board shared this understanding. The CISO replied, Yes, because I have conditioned them to that definition (Executive 4). Conditioning goes beyond definitions to setting expectations for how a security program should function and for appropriate levels of risk. For example, one CISO presented the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to the board and explained, This is what a good program should look like (Executive 3). Another CISO set expectations for appropriate scores for a cybersecurity maturity model: [T]here were more questions around risk and, Why should we only be a three and a half versus a five? Why dont you want to be a five…? You know, doesnt   25  everybody want to have As? But thats not how the model works. You dont need to be a five in everything. So we had to kind of explain that to them… (Executive 2) One consultant compared this process of setting expectations to a negotiation with the board: ‘We do not want to be the next Anthem, they said. ‘No breaches. The CISO very wisely said, ‘That is impossible, but what I can promise to you… (Consultant 7).  In cases of low expertise on the board, CISOs not only set expectations but also determine what type of information is reported to the board, because directors do not know what type of information about the cybersecurity program they would like to receive from management. For example, one CISO explained:  [T]he boards really dont know what they want to know, in what format. Theres nothing thats been established, like in accounting or finance, where things seem pretty straightforward. … And so, were all going through this process of developing what should the board see? and what should they care about? … Its probably a journey of, Okay, what resonates with the board and helps them provide the best oversight? (Executive 3) Further, one CISO described steering the board to a particular form of cybersecurity audit because they didnt know what they were asking for (Executive 5). In addition, CISOs described instructing the board about what types of questions are useful for the board to ask the CISO.  The coaching activities described above demonstrate the dependence of low expertise boards on the CISO to learn what cybersecurity oversight should entail and how oversight should be conducted, including how to determine acceptable risk levels, what metrics to look at, what questions to ask, and whether to engage third parties to verify the firms cybersecurity position. Thus, our interviews suggest that the expertise gap gives rise to circular governance whereby the subjects of oversight (in this case, CISOs) are able to significantly influence the nature and terms of the oversight. Overall, this dynamic does not appear consistent with expectations from agency theory that boards will provide independent oversight. Rather, consistent with self efficacy theory,   26  our findings suggest that low expertise leads to boards effectively ceding key aspects of their oversight role to the CISO.  Expertise Enables Board Members to Detect False or Withheld Information A manifestation of the agency conflict between the board and a CISO is the tendency of the latter to filter cybersecurity reports to improve the boards assessment of the CISOs performance. Due to the sensitive nature of this issue, we asked participants about their perceptions of whether this dynamic is common in other companies. There was variation among interviewees regarding the prevalence of CISOs filtering reports, with some expressing the opinion that filtering is human nature and thus widespread. A CISO explained that it was in his/her nature to be honest and forthcoming but reflected on other CISOs tendencies to filter out negative information from reports to make themselves look better: I know that happens, just because I hear [other CISOs] say those words: ‘You got to craft the message to the board (Executive 1). When asked whether filtering by the CISO happens, a consultant flatly stated, Oh, of course. All the time (Consultant 3). Among the executives and consultants we interviewed, only one stated the belief that CISO obfuscation is not a potential concern, sharing, I can only speak to my small inner circle of CISOs I know—they want to be transparent. They are not hiding things, I have never heard of that being done (Executive 4). To corroborate our interviewees views that opportunistically filtering reports is a common practice, we surveyed an additional 33 cybersecurity executives.16 In response to the question, From your impression of firms in general, what percentage of CISOs filter their reports to the  16 We administered the survey to members of Gartners CISO Coalition, a network for collaboration and information sharing among CISOs and other cybersecurity executives.   27  board to make themselves or their superiors look better? the mean (median) is 42 (40) percent of CISOs, and all but one respondent reported a nonzero percentage.17 We find that, compared to CISOs and consultants, directors more often view CISOs as unlikely or unable to obfuscate. Among the eleven directors we interviewed, five shared that filtering was unlikely to occur or otherwise downplayed the existence of a conflict with management. For example, one director commented, I think most of the CISOs I have seen are like internal auditors. Theyre not trying to hide things (Director 10). Another director similarly shared, I would say [at our company], everybody wants to do the same thing. Because they know if there is a gap that could be a problem tomorrow. It could bring the company down. So, theres very little inclination to do anything other than use the data for good (Director 2). Related to the lack of a perceived agency conflict, a director explained why he/she would not advocate hiring a third party to independently verify the CISOs work: I think youve got to work with the owner. If I tell you, ‘You own this risk, then I cant then go and say, ‘Im going to hire somebody else to see if youre doing your job. I dont think that works. Its got to be a team approach (Director 1). All three director participants with cybersecurity executive experience strongly acknowledged the potential for CISO obfuscation. One said, I think theres always that risk and I think that a board should have a high awareness and concern for that. (Director 5).  Respondents suggested that board members sophistication with cybersecurity is an important factor in limiting this behavior. A CISO candidly shared his/her experience under a prior CIO (who was above the CISO in the organizational hierarchy):  [The former CIO] always used his presentation to sell.… That is my perception of how it was. Paint your performance in the best possible light—that was my  17 In criminology, it is assumed that respondents self censor their reports of socially undesirable behavior. Therefore, any nonzero response is considered meaningful (Paternoster and Simpson 1996; Piquero, Bouffard, Piquero, and Craig 2016). In addition, asking about behavior of respondents peers is a common way of reducing social desirability bias (Fisher 1993).   28  direction at all times. Yeah were perfect, were on track with our plan. In reality, it wasnt as smooth as we presented to the board. (Executive 5) When asked whether the expertise gap exacerbates the tendency to present a rosy picture of cybersecurity, this CISO responded, If (the board) cant ask questions, then absolutely (Executive 5). Another CISO described director expertise curbing filtering: If we didnt have a person with the domain knowledge, it would be very easy to hide things and obfuscate things. Or, you know, youre going to sing your praises, right? …. Transparency is really, really important to us. But I definitely think it would be possible to not be transparent and to hide or obfuscate things, or bury risks that are uncomfortable or that you dont want to talk about. (Executive 2) Another respondent emphasized the importance of directors knowing the right questions to ask, such that they can decipher truth from fiction or snow from reality and what the CISO or the CISOs advisors are telling him or her (Consultant 7). A CISO described it this way:  I think [cybersecurity expertise] enhances oversight … It gives the board the ability to smell out a situation where management may be whitewashing a particular subject, or they might be trying to speak at a level that … really doesnt get to the root of a certain situation. (Executive 3) In summary, we find that, as emphasized by agency theory, conflicts do exist in the board manager relationship. However, inconsistent with agency theory, we find that directors may not recognize managers incentives or ability to obfuscate information. Moreover, when boards lack cybersecurity expertise, the potential for agency costs is greater. A director summarized the vulnerable position of a board lacking cybersecurity expertise. In contrast to the typically deep financial expertise that most boards possess, the comparative dearth of cybersecurity knowledge leaves boards having to rely on CISOs reports based on trust and faith: [T]he number of [board members] who have hands on expertise enough to comprehend the cyber issues in detail and ask the kinds of questions a board member typically is capable of asking a CFO—about cashflow, about lending instruments, about credit risk, about the variety of common oversight type issues, days receivable outstanding, and the things that leap off of a page that a good board can provide good governance about—theres no analog for cyber. [Board members] dont know the metrics, they dont know the reports, they dont know the   29  content, and they really are just having to take it mostly on trust and faith. (Director 9) Expertise Enables Board Members to Challenge the CISO Related to the above, respondents explained that cybersecurity expertise enables a director to know what good looks like (Director 5, Consultant 7), and thus be better able to evaluate managements cybersecurity efforts and to challenge (Consultant 3, Executive 8) management on issues that arise. A consultant described this as, They are going to want to see real metrics. They will go into a deeper level of detail. And the most important thing is that they understand what the CISO is saying. And they can challenge her (Consultant 3). Another observed: [Having a cybersecurity expert on board] really calls and exacts more of the CSO or CISO who is going into the event, knowing that theres that kind of expertise on the board and what you might be asked about and what you need to be prepared to answer. (Executive 7) Similarly, an executive described how, after the board appointed a new director with a strong cyber background for the first time, this savvy director could challenge our CISO on materials and information being presented (Executive 8). More broadly, cybersecurity expertise enables board members to assess the quality and/or fit of the CISO for the organization (Director 11). Although agency theory assumes boards will be an independent check on management, our participants suggest that expertise provides directors with both the motivation and the ability to move beyond symbolic oversight and instead provide critical feedback to cybersecurity executives. Expertise Influences Directors Proactive Engagement Although much of the board oversight described by participants occurs during regular board meetings through formal reporting and questioning processes, our interviews revealed that a major form of substantive oversight can occur when directors voluntarily engage beyond formal processes, which we term stepping up. This type of oversight is unstructured and self selected   30  and most often undertaken by directors who have more expertise in cybersecurity (Director 2, Executive 2, Consultant 7).  Stepping up often involves reoccurring ad hoc conversations and meetings and information sharing between the proactive director and the CISO (Executive 1, Director 2, Executive 6, Consultant 3); these informal interactions foster both information sharing and relationship building. Other forms of stepping up include attending meetings beyond a directors assignments (Executive 1, Consultant 7), providing critical feedback on the cybersecurity program both at the oversight and management level (Director 1, Director 10, Executive 7, Executive 8), initiating engagements with cybersecurity consultants (Director 1, Executive 2, Consultant 3), acting as an intermediary between the CISO and the CEO (Consultant 3, Executive 8), questioning the CEO and other non CISO executives about cybersecurity (Executive 2), increasing budgetary spending (Consultant 3), requesting additional information (Consultant 7), requesting specific benchmarking (Consultant 7), and previewing the CISOs report before it is presented to the board (Director 5). A specific form of stepping up is a director choosing to take a deep dive into the firms cybersecurity program (Executive 2, Director 5, Consultant 7). A deep dive is a focused period of learning about the firms cybersecurity systems and issues, which can help the director have a better institutional understanding of the firms specific cybersecurity risks, the programs being instituted, the investments in the program, and the activities and capabilities of management. One director who also has cybersecurity executive experience initiated one such deep dive:  As a sitting CIO and someone who has grown up in the cyber space, I certainly wanted to see a little more focus on that and a little more structure, which is why I suggested to the board that we have an independent review. And at first their question was Why, what are you worried about? I said, I dont know. I dont know what to be worried about if I dont know…. I said, You hired me for a   31  reason. Heres my experience, and heres where things can go wrong. Im not saying they have, but wouldnt you like to make sure? (Director 5)  Such deep dives tend to cause additional work for management and spur them toward improving their systems (Executive 2). [Without the director that stepped up], I dont know that we ever wouldve had this maturity model in place. … certainly we wouldnt have done that third party review and bring that in. Because … its not cheap. It costs a lot of money to have these guys come do this work. So yeah, I think we would be at a very different [place]. ….Youre forcing me to face the reality that I dont want to face, which was [Director X] giving us that kick in the ass, frankly, was probably one of the better things that happened to us. It forced us to really start to look at how we measure maturity and to understand what its going to take to move those maturity curves forward, and what initiatives we need to take to move those things forward. I dont think we would have, if [the director] hadnt pushed us on that…. [I]t was just a ton of work by me and my team to move that one forward. But had we not done that, we wouldnt be where we are today. (Executive 2)  While we document various forms of stepping up as a common organic oversight phenomenon, because this form of oversight is not embedded in governance processes, the more usual course is for directors with low expertise to perform superficial oversight (Consultant 1, Director 9, Executive 5, Consultant 3, Consultant 6, Consultant 7, Executive 8). Altogether, our field evidence indicates that the relationship dynamics between the board and the CISO varies based on board cybersecurity expertise. In the case of low expertise, the relationship is more likely to be characterized by low oversight independence, with the board being guided by and over relying on the CISO. With high expertise, high oversight independence is more likely, as indicated by the board proactively monitoring, advising, and providing substantive feedback to the CISO. Table 5 provides additional examples of interview evidence showing these relationship dynamics.   32  Is Cybersecurity Expertise Needed? As described in the previous two sections, the benefits of board cybersecurity expertise for monitoring effectiveness were widely acknowledged by our interviewees. However, our respondents frequently pointed out that such expertise is lacking for most boards. For example, a CISO said that most boards cybersecurity expertise is woefully inadequate (Executive 9). One consultant pointed to the real naivety of boards in terms of cybersecurity (Consultant 6), and another said that the average board rates a 3 on a cybersecurity expertise scale of 1 10 (Consultant 5). A board member with cybersecurity expertise observed: [M]ost boards are simply completely incapable of overseeing cyber risk. Its just so far outside of their experience and their expertise that all they can do is assess the credibility of the executives that are put in front of them… Lets make clear, most people on a board today…, if they have a technical background, were practitioners before the dawn of the internet. (Director 9) Many participants shared their view that cyber expertise is needed for boards to effectively monitor cyber risk. For example, one executive explained that expertise is needed to prevent check the box oversight: [Cybersecurity] is one of those areas where there needs to be time, energy and expertise. And you need to have the right makeup of the board to make sure that its not just a pencil to check the box. … You need to have at least one, if not a couple, people that can really challenge [executives] and ask all the right questions… You want to have people on the board that really have domain expertise in there. That they can look at the CEO and say, youre doing a good job or, in some cases, youre weak in this area. …[T]his is an area where every board, with any company of scale, should have this kind of expertise. (Executive 8) In contrast, some participants discounted the importance of directors having cyber expertise per se. For example, some directors claimed that general business experience sufficiently qualified them to oversee cybersecurity: [O]n my boards, I think we ask the right questions; we get the right people in front of us. I think we make good, sound judgments and do our duty, in spite of the fact that we dont have all this cyber background. (Director 3)   33  One director went so far as to argue that a lack of technical expertise can be a strength if a director has a holistic understanding of business risk: [S]ometimes, people with the least technical knowledge in many ways have a better perspective on understanding business risk and enterprise risk associated with it, but theyre thinking about it in [a] holistic context than dropping you down into this technical silo, which youre not an expert in anyway. The issue is broader than that. … I think its a topic that everybody can contribute to, and maybe contribute differently. Its important to think about the totality of the risk and the problem. (Director 6) Interestingly, whereas most CISOs argued that board membership should have cybersecurity expertise, some CISOs believed that board level cybersecurity expertise is unnecessary or can even be detrimental to the cybersecurity function in some cases. For example, one CISO thought that a director with cybersecurity expertise could interfere with or unhelpfully divert the management of cybersecurity: Theres a little bit of risk that they could want to get their fingers into things a little bit more than they probably should as part of being a board member. … Certain things a board member can say or ask for can really spin off an organization into going down a path of doing a lot of work that may not ultimately have a lot of value to it. (Executive 3) Another way that cybersecurity expertise can be counterproductive is if it decreases the frequency of board CISO interactions: It used to be when the chair of the audit and risk committee would have a particular question, shed call me and Id tell her whatever. Now, she always wants [to talk to the new board member with cybersecurity expertise]. And its like, fine. I dont care, [that person] and I get along fine. In fact, we probably agree on a lot. But again, I think to some degree, it may have hampered some conversation. (Executive 6) Others felt that the mere presence of a director with cybersecurity expertise on the board could cause the rest of the board to over rely on that person (Director 3) or create a false sense of security among the board in general:  I think if youre not careful, youve created a false sense of security—an illusion that you now have this expert that has such a breadth of knowledge that youre   34  going to be able to manage this differently. I honestly dont think thats very possible. (Director 6) Some participants shared practical barriers that prevent boards from having directors with cybersecurity skills. For example, despite the desirability or even the need for board expertise, participants cite the scarcity of such qualifications in the director labor pool as preventing boards from achieving the desired levels of cybersecurity expertise (Consultant 5). Others felt that it is not reasonable for board members to have a detailed understanding of cybersecurity because thats the job of the CISO and the [cybersecurity] team (Consultant 4) and that investment would be better spent on cybersecurity staff working at the company (Director 4).  Participants also clarified that cybersecurity cannot be a board members sole area of expertise because of the responsibility of board members to oversee the business generally: [Y]ou really want people [on the board] that are very broad based in knowledge and not necessarily [have] deep expertise. … [H]aving board members that are much broader and can contribute more broadly may be more beneficial … [compared to] directors [with] more narrow technology experience. (Executive 6)  To give up a board seat to a single skill director can have different impacts on that board. They would rather have somebody with broader business experience so they can hit topics across all the organization. (Consultant 2) These statements illustrate a perception that a director with cybersecurity expertise will have little to contribute to the board beyond cybersecurity (Consultant 7), and companies should not waste the board seat on just someone who goes with their top technology, not understanding or helping drive their business strategy (Director 5). Rather than appointing a director with only narrow cybersecurity skills to bring to the table, some participants suggested that an independent consultant can be engaged to support the board without giving up a board seat: I dont think you should get a board member that the only thing he or she brings to the board is cybersecurity. If thats all you want, then dont get a board member. Just go hire an outside consultant and have them come and do that every time. Because a board member has a lot of other things that he or she has got to worry   35  about besides cybersecurity. … Because you can buy that. You can buy that. (Director 1) However, other participants raised concerns about relying on outsourced expertise rather than having a board level cyber expert. First, relying on consultants when the board does not have cybersecurity expertise can result in the complete outsourcing of oversight, consistent with self efficacy theory. Second, the board may not be able to determine what types of cybersecurity engagements are needed. In fact, consultants must often explain to boards the different types of cybersecurity related engagements that are available (Consultant 3). Third, directors may not be able to assess the quality of a consulting firms work product (Consultant 6). When asked whether directors have the ability to assess the quality of consultants work, one consultant responded: No, I think they cant. I think frequently theyll turn to a well known name, usually an audit company—KPMG or Deloitte or somebody. Theyll turn to either their internal audit company or their external company. And frequently, those companies will throw in a cyber audit or a cyber review as a freebie. Oh, sure, we are an external audit company, and we can do that for you, and it wont cost you anything, or itll cost you very little. And I mean, you get what you pay for. … [Y]oure literally going to get the same report they did for their last client. Its a complete template, complete cookie cutter. And weve even seen times when theyve failed to take the name of the last client off the PowerPoint slides. (Consultant 3) Given the abovementioned benefits of expertise on oversight effectiveness, some nomination committees have added cybersecurity expertise or skill as a key factor for recent or upcoming appointments (Director 5, Executive 8). Table 6 presents additional examples of evidence of participant perspectives on the need for directors to have this expertise. However, an open question remains of what actually qualifies as cybersecurity expertise, which we consider next. What Qualifies as Relevant Expertise Given the predominantly held view that cybersecurity expertise is beneficial and thus needed at the board level, an important question is what qualifies a director as having cybersecurity expertise. Although participants acknowledged that training programs aimed at board members   36  are helpful, such as the NACDs Cyber Risk Oversight Certificate program for directors (NACD 2021), they stressed that such programs are not substitutes for work experience in cybersecurity (Executive 8). Participants characterized the ideal board member with cybersecurity expertise as someone who has experience in managing cybersecurity (such as a CISO) or who has directly overseen cybersecurity (such as a CIO or CTO): [W]hat makes a good board member relative to cybersecurity, in an ideal world? Theyre a former CISO. They have sat in the chair, theyve done it before, theyve done it well, they know what good looks like. I think thats what makes any board member a good board member is they know what excellence [is]… …and they can hold the company to a higher standard by governing it accordingly. Thats in an ideal world. In a subpar, sub ideal world, it may be somebody who, at least, was in a related field, maybe somebody who was in a technology company, maybe an educator who teaches cybersecurity, or at least he knows the frameworks and the questions to ask. (Consultant 7) Actual expertise in cybersecurity is more important than a particular job title, with participants acknowledging that some CIOs are very proficient in cybersecurity and others are not. For example, in some organizations, the cybersecurity function may be independent from the IT function and the CIO (Executive 3, Executive 6). Others were careful to point out that technology expertise is not the same as cybersecurity expertise, Just like running a factory is not the same as building a factory (Director 2). One CTO and former director admitted: [Is there] a proclivity for technologists like myself to overestimate our cyber skills? Yes. I think thats fair. Cyber is its own discipline. Its just its own knowledge base. If youre building things, there is a set of considerations and if youre securing things, its a different [set]. … Its such a different mindset and a different set of tools. (Director 9) Participants argued that you have to have subject matter expertise from past experience [for a directors expertise] to be relevant (Consultant 3) and that it is important for boards to have people that have actually got their hands dirty working in cybersecurity (Executive 8). Similarly,   37  participants commented that experience in board oversight of cybersecurity—even in a specialized committee, such as audit or risk—is insufficient to qualify a director as a cybersecurity expert: You cant just say, I served on a committee, thats not enough. (Unless you served on a committee maybe at a technology company for 10 years. I mean that might be different.) You need to get somebody on the board who has a more technical background, whos been a CIO or had to be in these kinds of [cybersecurity related] environments. (Director 11) However, a complicating issue for characterizing expertise based on past work experience is that cybersecurity expertise decays, so that a director with prior CISO work experience may not necessarily be current in their cybersecurity skills (Consultant 2, Director 9). Table 7 presents additional selections of interview evidence of participant perspectives on what qualifies as cybersecurity expertise. V. CONCLUSION Our qualitative field study incorporates perspectives from board directors, cybersecurity executives, and cybersecurity consultants who support boards to investigate how boards conduct cybersecurity oversight and the influence of boards cybersecurity expertise. Our interviews suggest that the level of expertise has a pervasive impact on the attention boards give to cybersecurity issues and the quality of their oversight. Our participants revealed that a lack of expertise can result in superficial oversight with a compliance orientation, which is inconsistent with regulators and investors expectations for the board to provide substantive oversight of cybersecurity. Our findings also suggest that boards are often unable to ask effective questions, understand the answers they receive, or detect filtered or withheld reporting. More broadly, the expertise gap between boards and the cybersecurity executives they oversee can result in circular governance, a dynamic whereby executives coach the board not only on basic cybersecurity principles but also on the process of oversight itself. Such circular governance appears to strongly   38  contradict expectations from agency theory that boards will provide independent oversight of management, and is more consistent with low expertise resulting in directors ceding control of oversight, as predicted by self efficacy theory. Overall, our findings highlight that without sufficient domain specific expertise, the board is unlikely to fulfill the monitoring role emphasized in the agency based perspective of corporate governance. Our results have implications for the ongoing debate on whether cybersecurity expertise is needed at the board level and whether/how board cybersecurity expertise should be required for public firms (S.808 2021). Although our evidence suggests that effective oversight requires domain expertise and raises the potential for cybersecurity related corporate governance failures when inexpert boards cede control of oversight, we are careful to note that the policy implications of our findings are not obvious. More broadly, our study does not encompass a full examination of the relative benefits of cybersecurity expertise vis à vis other director qualifications. Thus, while we do not attempt to directly investigate the costs and benefits of requiring cybersecurity expertise at the board level, we believe that our study provides useful insights for policymakers and shareholders as they make decisions relative to board qualifications. We also contribute to the literature on the role of director expertise in determining oversight effectiveness. Given that cybersecurity risk oversight is often delegated to audit committees, our findings add to our understanding of what audit committee characteristics enhance its effectiveness. While audit committee duties typically include the oversight of financial reporting and enterprise risk management, most extant research focuses on financial reporting (e.g., Klein 2002; Gendron and Bédard 2006; Cohen et al. 2014; Lisic et al. 2019; Couchoux 2021). In contrast, less is known about what characteristics are important for risk oversight, particularly for cybersecurity risk. Our study responds to the call to investigate how cybersecurity risk is handled   39  as part of a firms enterprise risk management (Cohen, Krishnamoorthy, and Wright 2017) and highlights that cybersecurity is normally outside the expertise of most directors, yet boards are still tasked with overseeing the increasingly prominent risks in this very technical domain. Our findings suggest that boards often lack the necessary expertise to fulfill the risk oversight role expected of them.  A related concern is that the audit committees may be overburdened with both financial reporting and risk oversight responsibilities (KPMG 2015). For example, when audit committees are tasked with risk related oversight responsibilities in addition to their primary focus on financial reporting, the quality of the latter may suffer (Ashraf, Choudhary, and Jaggi 2021). Couchoux (2021) explores audit committee styles and finds that, when audit committees are burdened with disparate tasks, their expertise is unlikely to relate to all of the committees tasks. To the extent that financial reporting and general risk oversight represent competing demands on director attention, our findings suggest that, in the absence of cybersecurity expertise, boards may give inadequate attention to cybersecurity risks, calling into question the appropriateness of tasking the audit committee with risk oversight duties.  Although the focus of this study is on cybersecurity, we expect that our findings have relevance to other areas that boards are asked to oversee, despite not having relevant experience or expertise in those areas. For example, boards are increasingly expected to oversee culture, diversity, and inclusiveness, as well as environmental initiatives (Vittorio 2019; Burke 2021), despite the fact that skills in these areas may be unrelated to the skills underlying the directors nominations to the board in the first place. Although the extant archival evidence finds that expertise in various domains is associated with firm outcomes, through the lens of self efficacy theory, our study provides a rich description of how expertise affects the oversight process.   40  References Abbott, L.

Managers are self interested and have motives distinct from shareholders that cannot be costlessly resolved through contracting. The board of directors represents shareholders and one of their primary functions is to constrain management opportunism through providing oversight (Fama and Jensen 1983). Role of expertise: By assumption, the board has sufficient expertise fulfill their oversight role (Fama and Jensen 1983; Jensen 1993). Expected findings: The board recognizes the potential for agency conflicts with management and provides substantive, independent oversight of the firms cybersecurity program.  Self efficacy theory Description:  Self efficacy is an individuals perception of their domain specific capabilities to act upon prospective situations due to past experience and performance (Bandura 1982, 1986).  Role of Expertise:  Expertise increases an individuals self efficacy (Bandura 1986), which in turn drives an individuals focus and actions, and leads to higher attention and improved performance. Expected findings: In the absence of cybersecurity expertise, boards will limit attention to cybersecurity issues. With low cybersecurity expertise, directors are more likely to cede oversight control to internal and external experts.  46  Table 2 Interview Details Panel A: Director interview details Interview # Committee participation related to cybersecurity oversight # of director positions Interview length (minutes) Cyber Expertise Declared skill on proxy statement Market Cap Represented industries Director 1 Audit (chair) 3 53 Low No Mid Wholesale trade Retail trade Services Director 2 Audit (member) 4 50 Med Yes Large Manufacturing Wholesale trade Director 3 Audit (chair) 2 67 Low No Mid Financial services Manufacturing Director 4 Audit (member) 2 63 Med Yes Mid Services Director 5 Audit (member) 2 49 High NA Mid Services Director 6 Audit (chair, member) 3 62 Med Yes Large Construction Financial services Director 7 None 3 63 Low No Mid Manufacturing Retail trade Financial services Director 8 Audit (member) 1 55 Low No Mid Services Director 9 None 1 32 High NA Mid Services Director 10 Audit (member),  Risk (member) 6 43 Low No Mid Services Financial services Director 11 Audit (member) 7 32 High No Mid Services Financial services   47  Panel B: Executive interview details Interview # Position Interview length (minutes) Cyber Expertise Market Cap Represented industries Executive 1 CIO 52 High Mid Wholesale trade Executive 2 CISO 66 High Mid Services Executive 3 CISO 60 High Mid Financial services Executive 4 CISO 46 High Large Transportation & Public Utilities Executive 5 CISO 61 High Mid Services Executive 6 CISO 63 High Large Financial services Executive 7 CISO 63 High Large Manufacturing Services Executive 8 CSO 63 High Large Manufacturing Executive 9 CISO 54 High Large Wholesale trade  Panel C: Consultant interview details Interview # Interview length (minutes) Cyber Expertise Type of consulting firm Consultant 1 45 High Technology solutions firm Consultant 2 50 Medium Big 4 accounting firm  Consultant 3 53 High Cybersecurity consulting firm Consultant 4 48 High Cybersecurity risk ratings firm Consultant 5 80 High Risk management consulting firm Consultant 6 84 High Risk management consulting firm Consultant 7 67 High Big 4 accounting firm  This table provides information about our three categories of interviewees and the firms they represent. Panel A presents director participants. The number of director positions reflects corporate director positions within five years of their interviews. Cybersecurity expertise is based on their self disclosure and verification based on their work history. Director 5 and Director 9 hold positions on private company boards and therefore no proxy statements were available. With the exception of Director 9 who was an executive director, all directors were independent directors. Two researchers independently categorized each participant and reconciled any differences in categorization. Market capitalization ranges are: Mid cap, $2 9.9 billion; Large cap, $10+ billion. This is based on the directors largest firm, if publicly listed, or annual revenues, if a private firm.   48  Table 3 Additional Interview Evidence of How Expertise Affects Boards Cybersecurity Oversight 4.1.1 The influence of expertise on attention [B]oard members want to be useful. They want to make the company successful and therefore, they are inclined to speak more about it and dwell on things where they feel like they can contribute. (Director 9)  Yeah, because your general board members, because they have their day life and whatever is exacting or commanding their attention in the course of any given week, may not have time to dabble in paradigm battles… And to even be positioned to even have the thought or to have it occur to you to even raise the implications of these emergent technologies, is probably not something a board member whose principal interests lie elsewhere, would have had the time to have even become aware that theres a question out there that you might want to pose or ask. (Executive 7)  [T]he board should make sure its got its governance structure right…. And if they do get that right, it has real world effects. Because then theres somebody on the board who is knowledgeable about cyber, and that means that the CISO has somebody to talk to. And there should be a line of communication between that board member and the CISO. And usually, that also means that the CISO gets out from under the CIO, doesnt report to the CIO directly. So if you get the governance model right, these issues are going to get better funding and then get more time and attention. (Consultant 3)  4.1.2 How expertise influences the quality of questions asked But [X, a director with more cyber expertise] just comes up with good ideas, good things to think about, or for management to think about. Not only just where do the ones and zeros go, but how are you structured, your organization? Where are you spending your time in your organization in your information areas? You know, your data processing areas and stuff. (Director 1)  I spend a lot of time in this area, so I will always make sure that Im comfortable personally, and then Ill meet with the CISO if we have a cyber security discussion, Im probably asking 3 or 4 questions for every 1 question that somebody else asks. Because I spend more time on it and Im also trained on it, so I think I know better what to ask. (Director 2)  [Director X] is probably our most versed person in his experience with these kinds of issues…. I know I wasnt brought in because of my cybersecurity expertise…. Its helpful to have someone whos kind of lived in the world on the front edge of things a little bit, and I think boards certainly would benefit by having somebody that has knowledge of what are the questions that need to be asked and the issues that need to be addressed so that you dont just get a kind of a glossy eye, ‘were on top of this and let us show you all the insurance we have to protect against all these different possibilities…. He just might ask more questions and have more insights than the average board member would. he tends to be someone who brings a little bit more to the party for that. (Director 8)  4.1.3 Expertise influences how answers are received [In response to: Did they ask you any follow up questions?] Nope. Which shows the maturity level of the board. They wouldnt be able to ask questions. (Executive 5)  Theres a language barrier here. Boards dont want to be embarrassed. They dont want to sit in a room and say, What is that acronym, and, What does that mean? Theyre not going to do that. (Consultant 6)  That doesnt mean that they understand the answers, and that doesnt mean that they know what to do about it… So boards are getting smarter and smart enough to ask the questions. Theyre just not yet smart enough to interpret what the CISO is saying. (Consultant 7)   49  Table 4 Participant provided Examples of Questions Directors Ask Superficial • Do we know what our critical assets are? (Executive 4) • Hey, what are we doing for cybersecurity? (Executive 2, Director 11) • Explain this whole cybersecurity thing to me. (Consultant 7) • How are we doing? (Consultant 3) • Are we moving in the right direction or not, and what are we doing about it if were not? (Executive 1)  • Are we compliant? (Consultant 1)  • Do you have somebody in charge of it?. . . Do they know what theyre doing? (Executive 2) • Do we have that risk? Or, could that have happened to us? [regarding hack in media] (Director 3, Director 5) • Whats our exposure to ransomware? (Consultant 4) • Do you have the right resources to fix it? (Executive 1) • Okay, what are we going to do about these things? (Director 1)  • Whats our disaster recovery plan for a cyber emergency look like? (Consultant 3) • This is great. What does that mean to us, from a business perspective? (Consultant 7) • Why havent you [done penetration tests]? When will you be doing it, and when will you be telling me the results? (Director 3)  Substantive • Knowing our critical assets are X. . . should we be changing our security model in these areas? (Executive 4)  • How are you structured, your organization? Where are you spending your time in your organization in your information areas? You know, your data processing areas and stuff. (Director 1)  • Hey, whats going on here? I thought we concluded we were going to do this. How do we get this back on track? (Director 1) • What sort of CASB do we have, and is it good enough? (Consultant 3) • Are you funded? How are you handling the cyber talent shortage? Do you get the right support? Whats the tone? (Executive 6)  • To what extent has our team embraced the solutions that are now proactively preventing malware and ransomware two years in advance of their appearance? (Executive 7) • How well insured are we? Which policies relate to this, for how much money? What are the requirements of those policies? Are we meeting the requirements of those policies? Can we demonstrate that we did that when we have a cyber breach, and now we want to make a claim? (Consultant 6)  • What is our policy on notification to law enforcement? When are we going to do it, on what? Who has the authority to do it? How does it work? What are the risks? (Consultant 6) • Do we encrypt our source code? Do we actually carry PII in un encrypted form? Are we PCI compliant on our credit card transactions? Do we actually throttle the database such that you cannot pull all customer records at one time? (Director 11)   50  Table 5 Additional Interview Evidence of the Relationship Between the Board and the CISO 4.2.1 Lack of expertise requires coaching by CISOs Educating the board The last presentation was to the full board, and they were just generally asking questions. A lot of them were generally asking questions about more, just trying to seek better understanding around cyber and what have you For a lot of the individuals, they were trying to still learn about cybersecurity. There were times where, especially right now with the . different types of cyberattacks that are occurring, theres a certain level of interest to really understanding more. (Executive 3)  One of the things that we implemented the first year I was here is a discipline, or I should say, a cadence where, at least once a year, we have a board education session. One year it was just security 101 kind of stuff. The anatomy of a program, how its built, how you evolved to the strategy, how you execute, that kind of stuff. And then we did a tabletop demonstration, how we do our annual cybersecurity, executive tabletop exercises. We had one session on, ‘How do you protect yourself from the criminal? kind of thing. So every year we have that, and thats really helped in board education. (Executive 6)  [T]he executive committee is essentially attending the audit committee meeting that I update in, which is great for me because its a super opportunity not just to educate the board but [also] the executive committee and keep them in the loop. (Executive 9)  Conditioning the board But we have really hammered that home, and this is the five functions that you align a cybersecurity program to. And this is the framework were using to manage cybersecurity. So this is what one should look like, these are the things that you should have in place. And then we go through a process saying, Well, this is the maturity of us against that framework of how weve implemented it. And then the rest of it becomes a little bit of trying to understand whats the best way to help them provide oversight, what are the best kind of reports. (Executive 3) [L]et us [the CISO and their team] tell you what the risks are, let us tell you what were most concerned about, and for those things were concerned about were going to report back to you on the progress we make on remediating that, and then. let me show you how were protected from an insurance standpoint, too, so if something does go bump in the night, its not going to harm the companys financial situation. (Director 8)  I took one of those [articles], The Top 10 Questions Boards Should Ask CISOs. We took the questions, I filled it out, and then we just gave it to the board members and their repository to pre answer before they ask. (Executive 6)  4.2.2 Expertise enables board members to detect false or withheld information  There is always a bit of protect your house. We know that information is filtered to the board and thats why its important to get outside sources of information…. [Regarding whether the filtering is unique to cybersecurity] I think it becomes more challenging because the boards may not know enough to ask as many questions. If you have a cyber expert it is probably not as big of an issue. It is more challenging because of the nature of it. …IT is a more dynamic thing that makes it more challenging. (Consultant 2)  [A director should be someone] who understands technology, who has done and overseen cybersecurity, so a former CIO, or a former CSO, somebody who has sat in the chair and has asked   51  those questions of a CSO, or been in the operations seat and has done these things before. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting snowed, and youre going to. (Consultant 7)  [In response to how oversight is different if there is a board with expertise] Well, I mean, to be crude, to not get bullshitted in a meeting, right? So if, if either one of you two are sitting in a meeting, a cyber meeting, and you see a board level presentation, which is generally going to be fairly high level. But youre going to know the right kind of questions to start asking. You hear something in that presentation where it feels like, Well, that feels a little weak, or Im not seeing something that I would expect to see in a cyber protection program here. …You bring somebody in, whos got real cyber expertise. I think that is a big risk mitigated for the board. (Executive 8)  4.2.3 Expertise enables board members to challenge the CISO  [Without a director with expertise,] I would predict that there wouldnt have been somebody in the audit and finance committee who wouldve stepped up, because theyre already busy. They got a lot to do. I would bet that somebody else, one of the other board members, wouldve asked the question …, So what are you guys doing about cybersecurity? We wouldve had to go in and present, but it wouldve been at a much higher level. [Without the director with expertise] I dont know that we ever wouldve had this maturity model in place. … [C]ertainly we wouldnt have done that third party review and bring that in.… I think we would be at a very different [level]. I think it took an IT person to be able to really drill in and understand at the level she wanted to. I dont think the others would just have the interest. They would just want to know its protected, and, Do you have somebody in charge of it, or, Do they know what theyre doing, kind of thing. (Executive 2)  In asking the CISO these questions, it was pretty clear the CISO was very old fashioned and was much more focused on keeping things out as opposed to assuming that people got in… And we ended up replacing that person. (Director 11)  I think having people now on the boards that have that expertise is a risk mitigator for companies because it really is allowing subject matter expertise on the board to go. Well pull out here. [As an example of director feedback] No, youre not making the right investment, or Youre not making the right level of investment. Or, Its clear to me that the IT leadership in this company doesnt have the expertise needed to deal with the risks that are facing this company. And I think thats the value of having a board member that understands the cyber space. (Executive 8)  4.2.4 Expertise influences directors proactive engagement  [Our more expert director] understands the ins and outs, and shes taken a liking to it. So she brings to the table a lot of things that we dont think about, and then she says, Well, have you thought about this? Have you thought about that? And that has been a godsend. (Director 1)  [An experienced director] said, Id like to see a third party brought in, somebody from the outside, to do an independent assessment of where you are from a cyber maturity perspective and then put together an initiative plan so we understand where youre going and what things youre doing. So we said, All right. We wanted to proactively get in front of that. (Executive 2)  [T]he audit committee chair said, I would like to do a benchmark and analysis using the same yardstick, the same measuring stick, to see how one [company] stacks up against the other, where were strong, where were weak, where theres synergies, where theres big gaps. And that launched our whole project. …Oftentimes, that is where it comes, is at the request of one board member who is seen as the IT or cybersecurity expert who can ask for those special things that sends the CISO or the CIO, or the chief risk officer, or the chief legal officer off to do these reports or these sorts of analyses. (Consultant 7)   52  Table 6 Additional Interview Evidence of Whether Cybersecurity Expertise is Needed Is cybersecurity expertise needed? Yes Having your own board member who is [themselves] an expert, in terms of the issues being discussed or presented, when the presenting CISO goes out of the room or looks away, [board members] can all look to you and say, thumbs up?, . [I]ts an extra little piece of validation, separate and independent of what their own personal entities might bring to the table. (Executive 7)  [T]he boards chock full of all sorts of people who have run large businesses and understand governance and understand strategy and financial management systems and supply chains and all those things. And theyre brought in because they had that experience. Why would you not do the same thing in your digitized space? Why wouldnt you bring somebody in that has that kind of expertise and knowledge, because in most corporations, that is the area where they are potentially the most singularly at risk for catastrophic failure. (Executive 8)  I actually am very much an advocate of having a strong cyber presence on the board.… [T]heres virtually no industry thats untouched by [cybersecurity] anymore, and its not going to get better in the short term. So I do support that approach and that regulation moving forward because I think the vast majority of boards are woefully—and this is from talking to peers and others—are inadequate in the space. I do support it. (Executive 9) Middle ground Theres a lot of debate out there about boards having a designated cyber expert. Im in the camp of, it depends. It depends on what kind of company it is. But definitely, the board has to have enough knowledge to understand risk presented by cyber risk, and then have confidence that management is executing to mitigate that risk. (Executive 6)  I think when you look at the board and the function of the board, you really want people that are very broad based in knowledge. And not necessarily deep expertise. The most important role of the board is that financial fiduciary responsibility. Certainly, youre going to have accounting and audit practitioners and things like that [W]hen you give a board seat thats dedicated to technology, or cyber, or some combination [thereof]., is that really benefiting the entire company? And for a technology company, its probably yes. Certainly in fact, most board members of a technology company ought to be somewhere out of the technology sphere. But were not a technology company, although were obviously more and more dependent on technology. (Executive 6)  Im not opposed to [having a cybersecurity expert on the board], but I think that the board having the ability to directly contract for ancillary support is probably a shorter term solution. I think in a long term solution, I think thats a great idea. But again, I wouldnt just put a cybersecurity person in there. I would put somebody in there who understands the holistic environment of security and risk. (Consultant 5) No The shareholders do not expect their board members to be experts in cybersecurity. They expect the company to have experts in cybersecurity and to be effectively deploying those to manage the risks, and I think the boards rely on third parties much like we do in an audit. (Director 4)  I think that for the level of oversight that theyre providing, that just to have a general understanding of awareness is important. Im not necessarily sure if they have to have a deep level. (Executive 3)  53  Table 7 Additional Interview Evidence of What Qualifies as Expertise What qualifies as relevant expertise I think the cyber and the IT coming together is really what is what you need… I think if you have made it to the ranks of being a Fortune 500 CIO, you understand youre accountable for both. Youre maybe in a smaller company that doesnt get that, then that can be a little bit different. But I think the pedigree of the CIO thats going to join a publicly traded company board is probably very much understanding [of both IT and cybersecurity]. (Director 5)  [T]here are luminary CISOs out there who understand how to make the connection between business and cybersecurity, who retire and join boards, and those are the ideal people. But… because youve got limited spots [on the board] from a governance perspective, to have somebody whos a single threaded cybersecurity expert, youve got to be a heavy technology or [intellectual property] based company to make that investment in the person, period. (Consultant 7) I think they have had to physically run [the cybersecurity] organization at scale in some company or have run an oversight organization. Maybe they came out of the US government and they are in the private sector now, or theyre in the private sector now where theyve come from some public organization, and they have that responsibility. (Executive 8) 54  Appendix A. Sample of Questions from Semi Structured Interviews  Note: Below are sample questions from our semi structured interviews. Given the semi structured nature of the interviews, these questions represent starting points for discussion. The interview script was customized according to the interviewees role (i.e., director, executive, or consultant) and relevant background. What does cybersecurity risk mean to you? Do you think that it would be defined in the same way by the directors on your boards? [If mentions challenges of cybersecurity] Can you speak to how the unique challenges related to cybersecurity cause your board to approach this risk differently from other enterprise risks? Outside of the board, who are the other major players with respect to cybersecurity risk management? Who provides oversight over these individuals and/or departments that are responsible for cybersecurity risk? Within the board, is oversight shared between committees or between the main board and committees? For those not on the audit/enterprise risk committee, do they also have responsibility for cybersecurity oversight? If so, what does cybersecurity oversight entail for them?  We would like you to think about the last four board meetings. How was cybersecurity covered, if at all? Overall, how would you characterize the boards level of experience with cybersecurity issues? Can you describe how an individual board members level of experience impacts how they provide cybersecurity oversight? [Can you give us any examples?] How does a given board members experience with cybersecurity impact the priority they place on cybersecurity oversight? How do board members educate themselves about cybersecurity? Do you think the board has enough expertise in cybersecurity to provide effective oversight for this risk? Why (why not)? Can you describe any challenges from overseeing management (e.g., CISO, CIO) with relatively more experience in cybersecurity?  Can you briefly talk about any cybersecurity consulting engagements [in the case of a consultant interviewee: your practice provides] that involve oversight at the board level?  Overall, how would you rate the boards effectiveness in cybersecurity risk oversight?  Does management have any incentive to filter the reports they give to the board?  Is there any advice you would give to another board on how to effectively oversee cybersecurity?  Is there anything you thought we would ask but we didnt, or is there anything else you would like to tell us?",3

We support the Commissions objective of enhancing and standardizing disclosures that registrants make about cybersecurity incidents and their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Cybersecurity threats present a critical risk to shareholders and more broadly, our macroeconomic environment. We applaud the Commissions efforts to set up a framework to improve the disclosures about material cybersecurity incidents and a robust cybersecurity risk management plan. We offer the following observations and recommendations on the proposal. Request for comment #17: Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Observations: We recommend adding the following aspects: 1. How does the organization quantifiably understand and measureably improve their cyber risk posture over time? An organization should have a consistent risk quantification methodology that incorporates governance across people, processes and technology, taking into account signals from across the tech stack  from Public (and private cloud), Saas and On Prom Assets to make up the organization wide risk posture. An organization should invest to build resilience by testing real time ability to remain within an accepted risk level. 2. How does the organization monitor its attack surface and open gaps on a real time basis? In an ever changing threat environment, visibility of internal controls is key to predict and prepare. As attack surfaces are getting more complex, it is easy to miss control gaps in your environment. These gaps can be then exploited by attackers.

How does the organization prioritize its cybersecurity investments and risk management plan? With limited investment budgets, security teams will have to always prioritize their actions. How does the security team prioritize? Is it generally based on intuition, or subjective inputs, or quantitative methods to maximize risk reduction? How does the security team take the requirements of different business unit owners into account for prioritization? Our experience shows that quantitative methods (such as bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo Simulations etc) that translate technical risk into business risk effectively, are the most effective in prioritizing. 4. How does the organization understand cyber risk by different applications, business units and business locations? With globally distributed companies with multiple applications processing (and storing) customer data, it is important to understand cyber risk by different applications, business units and locations of operations. For example, in a financial services company, the retail banking unit might have a different type of exposure compared to the investment banking unit. And accordingly, the risk management plan will be different. Similarly business locations expose companies to specific country regulations and risk factors. 5. How does the organization test its incident response and business continuity plans? Having these plans is not enough. Are those plans regularly stress tested? What is the frequency of testing? How are the plans improved regularly? Request for comment #26: Would proposed Item 407U) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way? Observations: We recommend to add the following: 1. Boards should ask for an objective visibility of inherent risk and residual risk after taking into account all risk mitigation and transfer controls being applied? 2. How frequently does the board interact with the IT and the Security team? 3. Does the board (or risk or the audit committee) have tabletop exercises with the IT and the Security team on cyber risk management? 4. How does the board translate the cyber risk into risk to shareholders value? 5. Boards should also question the Return on Security Investment (ROSI)? 6. Does the board sign off on the final acceptable residual risk?

I believe the SEC should provide public companies some enhanced guidance on governing cybersecurity risk while preserving flexibility on implementation. In particular, the SEC should consider revising the proposed rule so it: 1) Sets a standard minimum criteria of cybersecurity topics that must be reported to the board at least annually. This should include:  Top Cyber Risks and Emerging Threats to the Company  Program Strategy and Maturity Progress Report with Key Performance and Risk Indicators  Program Comparison to Industry and Peers  Areas where Risk Exceeds Management Appetite and Discussion on Risk Reduction Strategies  Audit and Regulatory Items 2) Requires disclosures to explain why it believes the board, collectively, has the ability to oversee these risks adequately rather than disclosure of one \cybersecurity expert,\ 3) Maintains the proposed safe harbor rule so its clear that if a board does hire a \cybersecurity expert\ it would not impose any greater liability on the cybersecurity expert than other members of the board. Hiring a cybersecurity expert should also not decrease the duties and obligations or liability of other board members, and 4) Enforces serious penalties for senior management who knowingly decide to cover up cybersecurity risks and other pertinent information to the board and in public filings.",1

INTRODUCTION Cybersecurity risk has gained considerable attention in the corporate world. Boards of directors face increasing pressure to understand and mitigate breaches of proprietary information.1 In a 2014 speech to the New York Stock Exchange, SEC Commissioner Aguilar urged boards of directors to increase their focus on technology related risks, stating …boards that choose to ignore, or minimize, the importance of cybersecurity oversight responsibility, do so at their own peril. Despite the increasing importance of cybersecurity risk, our understanding of the costs of cybersecurity breaches is limited. Among other costs, cybersecurity risks may increase the cost of borrowing. In this study, I provide empirical evidence on borrowing costs by examining the reactions of debtholders to cybersecurity breaches. Cybersecurity breaches arise from firms failing to protect proprietary information about customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders. These intangible, off balance sheet assets (e.g., customer relationships) are critical for future firm performance. Although the direct costs of breaches (e.g., technical investigations, remediation of systems and controls, litigation and penalties) may be substantial, the indirect costs of breaches (e.g., loss of intellectual property, devaluation of brand, lost customer relationships) may be far more significant (Deloitte 2016). Indirect costs are difficult to quantify, making them difficult to recognize and disclose. This paper quantifies an indirect, but measurable, cost of breaches: an increase in the cost of borrowing. The primary analyses focus on the private loan market. Inputs for measuring the cost of privately placed debt come from negotiated loan agreements, are directly observable, and are 1 J. Williams, a director at China Universal Asset Management and Shanghai F Road Commercial Services Co., cites cybercrime as a top issue facing boards of directors. A lot of organizations think they dont have a cybercrime problem—until they do. When they hear about an incident, their reaction is ‘were not like that company, so well be okay. The reality is everybodys at risk (Wall Street Journal 2016). Reinforcing this view, partners in two of the Big 4 accounting firms confirm boards of directors view cybersecurity as a top priority for the board and the business.  2  inherently less noisy than inferred cost of equity measures. Consistent with incomplete contracting theory, lenders use contractual terms to compensate for and protect against potentially adverse or uncertain outcomes. A cybersecurity breach is the realization of one possible adverse outcome that should increase the cost of debt to the extent lenders become more concerned the borrower will not fulfill its financial obligation (Lambert et al. 2007; Kamiya et al. 2020). When a breach occurs, fewer lenders may be willing to lend capital to the breached firm. Lenders willing to provide capital will likely charge higher interest rates and increase the use of non interest terms (e.g., performance pricing) to facilitate additional monitoring and limit potential losses (Strahan 1999).  Alternatively, a cybersecurity breach may not trigger any significant changes in loan contracts. Lenders use private information to assess a borrowers overall credit risk and financial liquidity (Diamond 1984; Fama 1985). Because of their contractual relation with a borrower, lenders typically have private information about a firms control environment, governance structure, and business complexity. Chen (2016) finds lenders use private information to anticipate and price misreporting risk prior to the public announcement of a restatement by a borrower. Given that cybersecurity risk is relatively new and the likelihood of a breach and the distribution of losses arising from breaches is still unknown, it is unclear whether lenders fully anticipate and price this risk, ex ante, in loan covenants and interest rates. In addition, lenders may perceive potential cybersecurity breaches as idiosyncratic risks that can be effectively diversified across loan portfolios. Thus, whether, and to what extent, the risk of a cybersecurity breach leads to an increase in the cost of debt and a change to contractual terms is an open empirical question. A cybersecurity breach has the potential to have a material adverse effect on the borrowers business and increase the cost of debt in two ways: increased monitoring costs and greater credit 3  risk.2 A breach reveals a lack of control over proprietary data, which may suggest a lack of controls more generally with respect to a firms operations. Well controlled information systems provide reliable data to manage business operations, mitigate risks, and assess performance. However, a cybersecurity breach is a negative signal about the quality of the internal control system. Based on this signal, lenders likely engage in additional monitoring, which is costly, through inquiry with management and onsite inspections (Wight et al. 2009). A second mechanism is changes in credit risk assessments. A breach can cause a significant reputational penalty in the form of a loss of customers and/or suppliers. If lenders believe cybersecurity breaches have the potential to affect a borrowers future performance adversely, then lenders may increase credit risk assessments and costs of borrowing. Lenders may also increase the use of non pricing loan terms to protect themselves against the increase in uncertainty associated with breaches. The sample includes 290 distinct firms experiencing a breach from 2005 to 2018. To begin the analysis, I examine various firm characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing a breach. Overall, I find breaches are more likely for firms that are larger, more mature, and more complex. Although larger firms likely have greater resources to invest in control systems and risk mitigation, larger firms also represent more profitable cyberattack targets because of the opportunity to gain access to larger amounts of valuable private information. This finding suggests the risk management capabilities of larger firms are not sufficient to deter potential breaches fully.  In the primary tests, I find consistent evidence that breaches are associated with increases in the cost of debt. I confirm the robustness of these results using a propensity score matched 2 Debt and merger contracts contain material adverse clauses, which legally protect lenders and acquirers by allowing contractual revisions if a borrower or target becomes less attractive because of a material adverse change. For example, the 2017 disclosure of Yahoos cybersecurity breach of 500 million accounts allowed Verizon to successfully renegotiate the acquisition price for Yahoo, costing Yahoo $350 million (Goel 2017). 4  sample.3 Prior literature finds that larger and more complex firms have lower costs of debt and attributes this result to more transparent information environments lowering monitoring costs for lenders (Booth 1992). However, larger and more complex firms are more likely to experience a breach. The results suggest the increased cost of debt following a breach (implying an increase in the cost of monitoring) subsumes the lower cost of debt that larger, more mature, and more complex borrowers would otherwise enjoy (because of a decrease in the costs of monitoring).  I find the cost of debt is higher for breached firms than non breached firms by an average of 30 basis points, which represents a 20 percent increase in loan spreads relative to a pre breach average spread of 149 basis points over LIBOR.4 These findings are economically significant and similar in magnitude to effects in prior work. Chen et al. (2016) find loan spreads increase by an average of 17 basis points after firms receive a modified audit opinion. Kim et al. (2011) find firms with material weaknesses have spreads 28 basis points higher than firms with no material weaknesses. Building on these prior studies, I examine cybersecurity breaches because breaches represent a failure in the control system but do not directly affect financial reporting quality. I also predict and find that, following a cybersecurity breach, firms loan contracts involve fewer lenders with non relationship lenders being unwilling to incur the additional monitoring and uncertainty associated with breached firms. While loans in the post breach period do not change with respect to collateral or financial covenants, lenders increase the use of performance pricing and originate smaller new loans, reflecting lenders efforts to protect themselves from increased uncertainty about the breached firms future performance. The findings support the intuition that 3 In a subsequent paper, Huang and Wang (2021) find results consistent with these findings. 4 Private communication with U.S. commercial lenders confirms loan pricing models incorporate cybersecurity breaches largely through qualitative factors, such as the quality of the internal control and monitoring systems.  5  cybersecurity risks are not yet fully anticipated and priced by lenders, and lenders do not view cybersecurity risks as fully diversifiable. I conduct several additional tests to provide further support for the effect a breach has on the cost of debt. In examining characteristics of breaches, I find third party infiltrations and larger breaches (i.e., more records, greater press coverage) are associated with larger increases in the cost of debt. The magnitude of the association between breaches and the cost of debt is also higher for borrowers with poorer credit ratings in the pre breach period, with less investment in control systems, and with significant changes in expectations about future cash flows following the breach.  This study contributes new evidence on the consequences of breaches on the cost of debt, which informs ongoing policy discussions and contributes to a growing literature on cybersecurity risk. Prior studies find breached firms increase investments in corporate social responsibility (Akey et al. 2019) and improve risk management (Kamiya et al. 2020). This study and concurrent work by Ashraf and Sunder (2020) provide complementary insights. While Ashraf and Sunder (2020) find changes in implied costs of equity following adoption of breach disclosure laws, this study provides evidence on changes in debt costs following realizations of breaches. This study also provides evidence on the extent to which lenders respond to risk realizations by shedding light on the importance of protecting proprietary information, an increasingly critical risk factor.5 Consistent with incomplete contracting theory, the results suggest lenders do not fully price protect against borrowers cybersecurity risk, ex ante, and increase the cost of debt after a breach. More broadly, this study has implications for regulation. In 2011 and again in 2018, the SEC issued guidance on cybersecurity breach disclosure obligations, clarifying that firms should 5 Prior literature examines the impact of firm events and characteristics on the cost of debt, including restatements (Graham et al. 2008); material weaknesses (Dhaliwal et al. 2011; Costello and Wittenberg Moerman 2011; Kim et al. 2011); and customer concentration (Dhaliwal et al. 2016). 6  disclose breaches if material (SEC 2011; SEC 2018). However, materiality is subject to interpretation and is difficult to assess given the substantial amount of indirect costs associated with a breach.6 This study informs the debate about disclosure by showing the extent to which informed lenders respond to the risks associated with cybersecurity breaches. Edith Ramirez, Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, argues, its clear that companies are not investing adequately in the area of data security, and that more needs to be done (Bush 2014). II. BACKGROUND, RELATED LITERATURE, AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT Background Technology has substantially increased firms ability to generate, collect, store, and analyze information on customers, suppliers, employees, and creditors. Yet, the increasing reliance upon proprietary information and technology also increases risk and drives the need to maintain effective controls over proprietary information and technology. In PricewaterhouseCoopers 2016 survey, 61 percent of CEOs state technology related threats (e.g., cybersecurity) are one of their most significant risks, posing a danger to corporate growth. Although a firms reputation forms over time, a failure to protect proprietary information can trigger a significant reputational loss by damaging stakeholder trust and confidence. From a monetary perspective, breaches can trigger litigation from a variety of stakeholders as well as fines from such agencies as the Federal Trade Commission and various State Attorneys General Offices. From an operating perspective, breaches can cause a loss of customers and vendors, resulting in lost future sales as well as higher operating costs. But to what extent does a cybersecurity breach impact the firms cost of capital? 6 For example, the Target Corporation experienced a breach in November 2013. On January 10, 2014, Target announced the costs associated with the breach may have a material, adverse effect on operations (Target 2014). On January 28, 2014, Senator Rockefeller issued a letter asking why Target appears to be ignoring SEC rules that require you [Target] to disclose to the SEC and your [Targets] investors the costs and business consequences of this recent data breach (Rockefeller 2014). Target subsequently filed an 8 K on February 26, 2014 related to the breach. 7  A recent consumer survey on privacy found nearly 20 percent of consumers will not purchase products or services from a firm with a reported breach (Morrison and Foerster 2016). This evidence suggests a breach has the potential to have negative operating consequences for the firm through the loss of customers, suppliers, and future growth opportunities. This paper attempts to broaden our understanding of the capital market effects of breaches with a particular focus on the privately placed debt market. See Appendix B for examples of breaches in the sample. Related Literature While an extensive literature examines the cost of capital consequences from financial reporting shocks, including weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) and restatements, breaches have not received as much attention in the literature despite the significant concern of executives and Boards of Directors related to cybersecurity risk. Work in information systems has examined equity market reactions to breaches. For example, using a sample of 72 breaches, Kannan et al. (2007) do not find a significant cumulative abnormal return in the 4 day window around a breach. Using a sample of 43 breaches, Campbell et al. (2003) find a significant cumulative abnormal return of 1.88%, driven by 11 breaches of confidential information (mean of 5.46%). The mixed results may be attributed to unclear disclosure requirements, the difficulty in quantifying and recognizing the impairment of off balance sheet intangible assets, the timeframe over which these costs are realized, and relatively low power tests because of small samples.  The literature on the consequences of cybersecurity breaches is growing. Kamiya et al. (2020) find breaches are associated with a decline in firm risk taking. Lawrence et al. (2018) find a positive relation between operating control risk and future issues in financial reporting quality. Lawrence et al. (2018) use two measures of operating control risk, including a textual measure from 10 Ks and an outcome measure, data breaches. Other studies examine the responses of 8  external stakeholders, including auditors (e.g., Smith et al. 2019; Rosati et al. 2020), depositors (Duffie and Younger 2019), and industry peers (Haislip et al. 2019; Ashraf 2020). Although this paper is tangentially related to prior work on the impact of restatements and material weaknesses on the cost of capital, cybersecurity breaches differ from financial reporting shocks in three fundamental ways. The first, and most obvious, is that a breach does not affect the quality of financial reporting. Indeed, the data being breached are typically not journal entries recorded in the accounting system. Second, a material weakness focuses on the likelihood of a material misstatement in financial reporting whereas a breach is the realization of a failure in the management control system. Third, breaches typically result from the actions of outsiders or an unintentional act of employees of the firm rather than from deliberate financial reporting decisions made by managers.  Cybersecurity Breaches and the Cost of Debt Loans explicitly obligate managers to be responsible agents of the borrowed capital. Debtholders expect managers to steward the capital entrusted to them to foster effective and profitable operations, growth, and continued investments in the firm. Agency theory has extensively studied the conflict between shareholders and managers (e.g., Jensen and Meckling 1976). Similar to the conflict between shareholders and managers, differing incentives can cause managers to make decisions that adversely affect creditors. These actions are typically characterized in the literature as managers making less profitable investment decisions, increasing the riskiness of the firm by substituting risky assets for existing assets, and diluting the claims of current debtholders. Because of the lack of upside potential debtholders face, debtholders engage in monitoring of borrowers to encourage actions in the debtholders interests (Myers 1977). 9  Debt contracting is based on incomplete information. Incomplete contracting theory recognizes that it is not feasible for lenders and borrowers to contract upon all potential states of the world because some information cannot be known (Knight 1921). Because contracting is costly, long term contracts cannot specify all future details, leaving the contract incomplete (Coase 1937). At origination, contract price is a function of an expected distribution of outcomes.  A breach of proprietary information is one of many possible future contingencies faced by borrowers and lenders. Such events have implications for expected future cash flows and credit risk. If lenders are ineffective at assessing cybersecurity risk when screening borrowers, lenders may use breaches as signals to reassess interest rates for future loans. The above arguments suggest borrowers face an increase in the cost of debt after a breach. The first hypothesis follows: H1: Relative to the pre breach period, the cost of debt increases for firms after a cybersecurity breach. Cybersecurity Breaches and Loan Structures Lenders use the occurrence of breaches (and their associated costs) to inform their expectation about the likelihood of a breach and the consequent loss distribution. If a breach occurs that lenders did not anticipate, lenders likely increase their monitoring activities. However, with a loan syndicate, monitoring activities are inherently problematic because monitoring is costly and lenders with smaller proportions of the syndicated loan have an incentive to free ride. Some lenders likely expect the cost of increased monitoring outweighs the incremental return on the debt contract. The increased cost of monitoring and increased uncertainty about the borrowers future cash flows can make a future loan unattractive to some lenders. Lenders make new loan decisions based upon their current portfolio of loans (Froot and Stein 1998). Without adequate compensation for bearing risk and the costs of monitoring, some lenders may be unwilling (or unable) to include riskier borrowers in their loan portfolio. Prior literature argues 10  that the number of lenders is a proxy for the underlying risk of the borrower: fewer lenders are willing to lend to firms with lower credit quality (Bolton and Scharfstein 1996; Bradley and Roberts 2015). The above arguments suggest fewer lenders will lend to breached firms, resulting in a contraction in the supply of available capital. The second hypothesis follows:  H2: Relative to the pre breach period, the number of lenders in a loan contract decreases for firms after a cybersecurity breach.  Cybersecurity Breaches and Non Interest Terms Lenders use price and non price loan terms to facilitate borrower monitoring. Debt contracts use non price terms to reduce the agency costs of debt that occur because of the conflict between shareholders and debtholders, as well as the conflict between lenders and borrowers (Vasvari 2008; Kim et al. 2011). Collateral provides the lender with specific borrower assets in the event the borrower defaults, mitigating future losses. Collateral serves as a disciplining mechanism, because of the threat of asset repossession, encouraging borrowers to pay their debts and not to engage in opportunistic behavior that could trigger repossession of collateralized assets. If lenders perceive borrowers as having greater credit risk, lenders are more likely to require secured debt (Rajan and Winton 1995). I expect a positive association between lenders increasing the likelihood of requiring collateral and cybersecurity breaches occurring. Lenders have an assortment of contract provisions from which to choose when providing capital to a firm. I consider the effect of a cybersecurity breach on three additional loan contracting terms: performance pricing, loan maturity, and loan size. If lenders view a breach as a revelation of lack of controls over proprietary data, and the borrowers operations more broadly, I predict lenders will engage in more monitoring and change their assessment of the borrowers credit risk. These two mechanisms will likely increase the use of performance pricing as lenders attempt to protect themselves from increased uncertainty about the breached firms future performance. In 11  addition, the lender is more likely to shorten the loan maturity and reduce the loan size to address the increased risk associated with a breach. The third hypothesis is presented below: H3a: Relative to the pre breach period, the likelihood of loans being secured increases, the likelihood of using performance pricing increases, loan maturity shortens, and loan size decreases for firms after a cybersecurity breach.  In addition to the non interest terms discussed above, financial covenants may change post breach. Smith and Warners (1979) costly contracting hypothesis argues that, when loan contracts include covenants which prevent borrowers from specific actions, the borrowers receive a benefit in the reduction of agency costs. By restricting borrowers behavior, covenants are designed to reduce moral hazard costs and protect lenders from future losses. Beneish and Press (1993) find technical violations of financial covenants impose costs on borrowers in terms of higher interest rates and additional covenants on subsequent loans. This finding suggests lenders may increase covenant usage after cybersecurity breaches to protect their claims. On the other hand, if lenders engage in increased monitoring (e.g., field inspections, management inquiry), there may be no change or even a reduction in covenant usage. Covenants are characterized as substitutes for direct monitoring because covenants serve as trip wires, transferring control rights from borrowers to lenders upon violation (Dichev and Skinner 2002; Dyreng et al. 2017). Costello and Wittenberg Moerman (2011) find a negative relation between interest rates and covenants for firms disclosing material weaknesses and suggest lenders distrust financial covenants as a monitoring mechanism because material weaknesses signal concerns about financial reporting quality. Although breaches are not a signal for financial reporting quality (see Section II), a breach may be an indication about the quality of the borrowers control system over operations. Due to the conflicting theory, the final hypothesis is presented in null form:  H3b: Relative to the pre breach period, financial covenant usage does not change for firms after a cybersecurity breach. 12  III. SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA Sample Selection and Composition The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), a non profit consumer advocacy organization, compiles data on privacy breaches.7 The PRC database contains information on the breached firms name, the date the breach became public, a brief description of the breach, and (when available) the number of records compromised. After manually matching each firm to CRSP and Compustat, the initial sample includes breach observations for 577 publicly listed firms. For the primary analyses, I match the sample of cybersecurity breached firms to the DealScan database using the matching table provided by Chava and Roberts (2008). DealScan is a Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) database containing detailed loan information on commercial loans, including the origination and maturity dates, the purpose and size of the loan, and the loan pricing terms. I restrict the loan sample to new loan initiations and refinancing agreements to increase the power of the test to capture changes occurring because of a cybersecurity breach. The intersection of the breach sample and DealScan results in a sample of 6,425 loans for 407 unique firms. The sample is further restricted due to control variable requirements, outlined in Table 1, Panel A. The final treatment sample contains 4,358 loans for 290 distinct firms. There is heterogeneity in the breaches I study. Table 1, Panel B, provides information on the nature of the breaches. Within the 290 breached firms, 121 firms experience a breach involving the loss of property (i.e., portable device, stationary device, physical property) containing proprietary information. 44 firms are involved in unintentional disclosure of information through 7 The PRC database includes breaches reported from either governmental agencies (e.g., California Attorney General) or media sources. In the main analyses, I do not limit the sample to specific types of breaches for two reasons. First, I am not aware of theory predicting which types of breaches provoke a stakeholder response. Second, I am interested in the protection of proprietary information generally. In Section V, I explore whether the magnitude of the association between a cybersecurity breach and the cost of debt varies by type of breach. 13  either electronic or non electronic means. Such unintentional disclosure can result from the firm itself or a stakeholder. 87 firms experience a third party infiltration, including hacking, malware, or payment card fraud. 23 firms are involved in a breach because an employee intentionally leaked the information externally. 15 firms have breaches that cannot be explicitly identified. Table 1, Panel C, shows the observations over time. I include in the sample firms with single or multiple breaches. If a firm experiences more than one breach in the sample period, I retain the multiple breaches for the determinants analysis but include only the first data breach in the cost of debt analyses. The sample spans fiscal years 2005 to 2018. Overall, breaches are dispersed throughout the sample period with the highest number of breach observations in 2006.  The industry composition of the sample is shown in Table 1, Panel D. Retail and general service industries comprise approximately 41 percent of the sample, which is consistent with the importance of customer and employee data to these industries.  Because little is known about the broader sample of cybersecurity breach firms, I examine differences in breached firms relative to two sets of control firms: non breached firms in Compustat, and non breached firms in DealScan (Table 2). The results suggest breached firms have higher market values of equity (MVE), greater analyst following (Analyst Following), and are more visible in the business press (Annual Press Coverage). These firms are more mature (Firm Age) relative to either set of control sample firms, involve a greater number of segments (Complexity), and are more likely to have foreign operations (Foreign Ops). Overall, the summary statistics suggest breached firms are generally larger, more stable, and more visible firms.8 Characteristics of Firms with Cybersecurity Breaches 8 Consistent with this study, Aldasoro et al. (2020) find larger firms are more likely to report a breach. 14  Before proceeding with the primary analyses, I perform a more extensive examination of the characteristics of firms experiencing a cybersecurity breach. There is limited theoretical guidance from prior research regarding the determinants of breaches. Therefore, while I discuss the intuition behind the examined variables, I view this portion of the study as exploratory. I first consider the effect of firm size as a determinant of cybersecurity breaches. Larger firms likely have a greater number of records (e.g., customer accounts, employee records) and transactions needing to be controlled. Significant amounts of proprietary data represent a greater potential opportunity for inappropriate access. Moreover, larger firms have a greater number of information systems supporting and facilitating their business operations. On the other hand, larger firms likely have more financial and human capital resources to devote to investment in developing cybersecurity controls. I measure firm size (MVE) as the natural logarithm of the firms market value of equity, calculated as share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.9 Another factor that likely determines the probability of a cybersecurity breach is the visibility (e.g., public prominence) of the firm. A higher degree of visibility likely increases the potential for a firm to be targeted for a breach. I use three measures of firm visibility: (1) Firm Age, measured as the natural logarithm of the number of years the firm has been listed on Compustat; (2) Analyst Following, measured as the natural logarithm of the number of analysts following the firm based on I/B/E/S. I set firms with missing analyst following equal to zero; and (3) Annual Press Coverage, measured as the number of business press articles. Following Drake et al. (2014), I use RavenPack articles with a relevance score greater than or equal to 90.   9 In untabulated analyses, I examine the robustness of market value of equity as a proxy for firm size. Size continues to be positively associated with the likelihood of experiencing a breach when measured as the natural logarithm of total assets, the natural logarithm of total sales, or an indicator variable for S&P 500 firms. 15  A third characteristic of breaches is the financial condition of the firm. Firms facing constrained financial conditions could be less likely to invest in management control systems. Doyle et al. (2007) find poorly performing firms are more likely to disclose material weaknesses and attribute this finding to an inability of these firms to invest sufficient financial resources into their financial reporting control systems. Similarly, I expect breaches will be more likely among firms with poorer financial health because those firms may not invest adequate financial resources to protect and control confidential information. To examine the impact of financial condition on a firms probability of experiencing a breach, I include Loss, which is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm has negative income before extraordinary items in year t or t 1.10 The nature of operations is also likely to be an important factor in the likelihood of a cybersecurity breach. I expect greater organizational complexity to be associated with a higher probability of a cybersecurity breach. Firms with more dispersed operations are more likely to have separate information and control systems relative to firms with more centralized operations. Relatedly, firms engaging in merger and acquisition activity are more likely to experience cybersecurity breaches because of the increased complexities associated with mergers. A primary reason for firms engaging in merger and acquisition activity is to obtain increased market power (e.g., acquisition of a competitor) or synergies through vertical integration (e.g., acquisition of a supplier or distributor). However, a consequence of mergers and acquisitions is often the existence of disparate information and control systems, which decreases the potential for effective and consistent controls to prevent and detect the loss of confidential information. Because the nature of a firms operations is a multi faceted construct, I examine several measures, including: (1) 10 In untabulated analysis, I use Default Risk as an alternative measure of financial condition, measured as (1) Altmans (1968) Z score; (2) the Shumway (2001) model; or (3) the first principal component from Altmans (1968) Z score, Ohlsons (1980) O score, and Shumways (2001) probability of bankruptcy, following Kim et al. (2011) and Dhaliwal et al. (2016). Financial condition continues to be positively associated with the likelihood of experiencing a breach. 16  Complexity, calculated as the natural logarithm of the number of geographic and operating segments; (2) Foreign Ops, which is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm reports non missing pre tax income from foreign operations, and zero otherwise; and (3) Acquisitions, defined as acquisition costs in year t, scaled by the market value of equity. A fifth potential characteristic of cybersecurity breaches is firm growth. Growth can strain the effectiveness of firms existing management control systems, increasing the potential for cybersecurity breaches to occur. Admittedly, high growth firms also tend to be smaller and younger. I control for both size and age in an attempt to isolate the effect of growth in the analysis. I expect to find an increased probability of a cybersecurity breach for high growth firms. I measure Sales Growth as the percentage change in sales from year t 1 to year t. To examine firm characteristics that increase the likelihood of a cybersecurity breach, I compare breached firms to the set of Compustat firms with data available to compute control variables, non missing total assets, and non missing income before operations. I specify the following logistic regression: ������������������������������������������������(������������������������������������������������������������ℎ) = ������������(������������0 + ������������1������������������������������������ + ������������2������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������ + ������������3������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������4������������������������ ������������������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������5������������������������������������������������ + ������������6������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������7������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������ + ������������8������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������9������������������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������������������������������ℎ + ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ + ������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ + ������������).  (1) Breach is set equal to one for firms experiencing a cybersecurity breach, and zero otherwise. I include industry fixed effects to account for certain industries being more susceptible to cybersecurity breaches. I include year fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the firm level. Table 3 presents the results from estimating the determinants of cybersecurity breaches from Equation (1).11 The results show breaches are more likely for firms that are larger (MVE) and 11 In untabulated analysis, I use a linear probability model to examine the robustness of the results. Results are qualitatively similar except the negative coefficient on Sales Growth is no longer significant. 17  are more visible (i.e., the positive coefficients on Firm Age, Analyst Following and Annual Press Coverage). Firms in poorer financial health, as measured by Loss, are more likely to experience a breach, which may reflect the firms inability to invest in management control systems to prevent breaches. With respect to firm operations, breaches are more likely for complex firms and firms involved in significant acquisitions. Breaches are more likely for lower growth firms; however, there is no significant relation between breaches and foreign operations. These results are consistent with larger and older firms being characterized as having lower growth prospects.  IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS Research Design The findings from the determinants analysis in Section III suggest certain firm characteristics are correlated with the probability of experiencing a breach. Based on these results, temporal changes in the cost of debt for breached firms are analyzed relative to a matched set of non breached firms. The matched sample uses all firms in the same two digit SIC industry with total assets within 10 percent of the breached firms total assets, measured in the year before the breach. Using a many to one design, a pseudo breach date is assigned to the matched control firms. The pseudo breach date is equal to the cybersecurity breach date of the matched treatment firms.  To evaluate the impact of a breach on a firms cost of debt, I specify the following regression with an observational unit defined as a single loan: ������������������������������������������������������������������������ = ������������0 + ������������1������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������2������������������������������������������������ + ������������3������������������������������������������������������������ ∗ ������������������������������������������������ + ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������.  (2) The dependent variable is the cost of private debt (Spread). Treat is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm experiences a cybersecurity breach, and zero otherwise. Post is an indicator variable set equal to one if the loan is originated after public disclosure of the breach or the assigned 18  pseudo breach date, and zero otherwise. The primary variable of interest is the difference in difference estimator, the interaction term of Treat*Post. Hypothesis 1 predicts loan spreads increase after a cybersecurity breach, which leads to a positive coefficient on β3. CONTROLS is a vector of control variables measuring firm specific, loan specific, and macroeconomic factors found to affect a firms loan contract terms. Appendix A provides variable definitions. For firm specific characteristics, I control for borrower size, which should have a negative relation with loan spreads. Larger firms are generally expected to be less risky than smaller firms (Berk 1995). MTB is a proxy for the firms growth opportunities. The expectation of the relation between growth opportunities and loan spreads is unclear. If lenders view the firms growth opportunities favorably, a negative coefficient is likely. However, a high growth firm may be associated with higher risk, which suggests a positive coefficient may result. Leverage is expected to be positively related to loan spreads because firms with more debt are likely to face higher borrowing costs. Profitability is expected to have a negative relation with spread because firms that are more profitable generally have lower default risk. If a borrower with more tangible assets should default, the lender can recover these assets in lieu of a cash payment, suggesting firms with more tangible assets have a lower cost of debt. Cash flow volatility is expected to be positively associated with borrowing costs.12 Finally, default risk is measured using Altmans (1968) Z score. Higher Z scores represent greater financial health and firms with higher Z scores are expected to have lower borrowing costs. Equation (2) also includes controls for loan specific variables shown by the loan contracting literature to be related to the cost of debt, including loan maturity, loan size, and performance pricing. Lenders, on average, charge lower interest rates for shorter duration loans 12 In untabulated results, I use cash flow volatility scaled by total assets and inferences remain unchanged. 19  and larger loan packages (Graham et al. 2008). Performance pricing automatically adjusts the spread on a loan based on changes in a firms credit quality (Asquith et al. 2005; Vasvari 2008). Because performance pricing may decrease the monitoring costs for lenders, loans with performance pricing are expected to have lower spreads.  In addition, I control for macroeconomic factors that affect the cost of debt. Following prior literature, Equation (2) includes controls for credit spread and term spread. Year fixed effects are included in the model to assure that unobservable time series changes are not driving the result. In subsequent model specifications, I incorporate industry year fixed effects to control for industry specific shocks over time, loan type and loan purpose indicators, and borrower fixed effects. A second set of analyses examines the impact of a cybersecurity breach on the number of lenders involved in a single loan (Number of Lenders). To provide greater insight into the changes in lender composition, I also examine the existence of relationship lending in the cross section. A third set of analyses examines the possibility that lenders may alter non interest terms after a breach. I use several dependent variables.13 The first is the likelihood of collateralization (Security). I also examine financial covenants tied to financial accounting information (e.g., minimum interest coverage ratio, maximum debt to EBITDA). Because performance pricing is a proxy for indirect monitoring, I analyze the effect of a breach on the potential to use performance pricing in subsequent loan contracts. In the event lenders use the maturity and size of a loan as a monitoring method, I examine the effect of a breach on loan maturity and loan size. Descriptive Statistics 13 Several non interest terms are indicator variables. For these dependent measures, I use linear probability models instead of nonlinear limited dependent variable models because of the fixed effects structure. Linear probability models overcome the potential bias and inconsistency in coefficients and standard errors that arise when using nonlinear limited dependent variable models (Greene 2004). In robustness tests, I reperform these analyses using traditional logistic regression models and results are qualitatively similar. 20  Table 4, Panel A, provides summary statistics of debt contract terms and univariate comparisons of the model variables. The sample contains 28,770 loan observations for 1,193 distinct firms. The sample includes 4,358 (24,412) treatment (control) loans for 290 (903) treatment (control) firms. The average spread for treatment firms is 149 basis points over LIBOR compared to 180 basis points for control firms, which is statistically significant at the one percent level. The average loan size is $1,089 million ($648 million) for treatment (control) firms. Table 4, Panel B, presents the correlation matrix for the main regression analysis. The correlations reveal several insights. Spread is positively correlated with Leverage (0.22) and Loan Maturity (0.30), suggesting firms with higher debt and longer term loans have higher costs. Consistent with prior literature, Spread is negatively correlated with Size, MTB, Profitability, and Default Risk, suggesting smaller firms with fewer growth opportunities, less profitability, and worse financial health are experience higher costs of debt. Larger loans (Loan Size) are negatively correlated with Spread, indicating lenders offer discounts to borrowers seeking more capital.  Empirical Results for Cybersecurity Breaches and the Cost of Debt Table 5 contains the regression results from estimates of Equation (2). Column (1) presents the cost of debt results with various firm level controls shown by prior literature to be important determinants of loan spreads. The variable of interest, Treat*Post, has a positive and significant coefficient (t statistic of 4.37), suggesting firms experiencing a breach face a higher cost of debt. Column (2) includes firm and loan specific control variables and Treat*Post continues to have a positive and significant coefficient. Column (3) adds controls for macroeconomic factors, which have little impact on the variable of interest and provides only a minor increase in the explanatory power of the model. Column (4) introduces industry year fixed effects, which absorbs industry specific trends over the sample period. Column (5) includes indicator variables for loan 21  type and loan purpose. Finally, Column (6) includes the addition of borrower fixed effects, thereby comparing loan spreads within firm before and after a breach. Across model specifications, Treat*Post continues to have a positive and significant coefficient. After including the full set of controls, results indicate the effect of a breach is economically significant with a 20 percent increase in spread post breach (on average). Based on the mean loan spread of treatment firms of 149 basis points, a breach increases the cost of debt by approximately 30 basis points. Overall, results are consistent with Hypothesis 1, indicating firms experience an increase in the cost of debt after a breach, relative to a control group of non breached firms. Empirical Results for Cybersecurity Breaches and Loan Structures To test Hypothesis 2, the effect of a breach on loan structure, I run Equation (2) with the number of lenders as the dependent variable. Table 6, Column (1), reports the results of the negative binomial regression of Number of Lenders on Treat*Post. This model includes industry year fixed effects and the full set of control variables.14 The coefficient on Treat*Post is negative and significant. Columns (2) and (3) incorporate loan type and loan purpose fixed effects and borrower fixed effects, respectively. Treat*Post continues to be negative and significant. This result suggests the number of lenders, on average, is decreasing for breached firms.  To provide greater insight into the lenders that continue to lend in the post period, I examine whether relationship lending is important in this setting. If borrowers have fostered relationships with lenders (i.e., relationship lending), it is plausible such lenders will continue to offer capital despite the increased uncertainty faced by a borrower after a cybersecurity breach. To 14 Number of Lenders is a count variable and requires a discrete data model (Cameron and Trivedi 1986). Because the Poisson regression generally does not fit the data well as evidenced by a rejection of the null hypothesis that the model is correctly specified (Prob > Chi squared = 0.001), I use a negative binomial model. In robustness tests, these analyses are performed using Poisson and OLS models. For the OLS regression, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the number of lenders. Results using alternative model specifications are qualitatively similar across specifications. 22  explore this possibility, I bifurcate the sample of lead lenders on whether the lead lender has provided capital to the borrower in any of the five prior years, consistent with Bharath et al. (2011). Columns (4) and (5) show new lead lenders (i.e., lenders not classified as relationship lenders) are more likely to exit the loan syndicate for firms experiencing a breach (t statistic of 2.94). The difference across the two subsamples is statistically significant (chi sq. of 3.90). The inferences that can be drawn from these findings are subject to limitation because DealScan does not provide explicit lender identities. I use the matching table provided by Chava and Roberts (2008) to identify lenders, limiting the inferences to publicly listed, Compustat firms. Empirical Results for Cybersecurity Breaches and Non Interest Terms I next examine the effect of breaches on non interest terms (Hypotheses 3a and 3b). Table 7 reports the results with various fixed effects structures (i.e., Panel A uses industry year; Panel B uses industry year, loan purpose, and loan type; Panel C uses borrower and industry year). First, because collateralization is an important aspect of private debt contracts, I estimate Equation (2) with Security as the dependent variable. Column (1) in Panels A, B, and C presents the results. The coefficient on Treat*Post is not statistically significant in any of the specifications.  Second, I examine the likelihood of subsequent loan contracts containing performance pricing terms. Performance pricing ties loan spreads to changes in credit quality or select financial ratios (e.g., leverage, interest coverage) and can be viewed as a type of lender monitoring (Asquith et al. 2005). Column (2) in Panels A, B, and C reports the results. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and statistically significant (t statistics of 2.92, 2.77, and 2.22), suggesting lenders are more likely to use performance pricing for breached firms in the post period.  I also examine loan maturity and loan size. If a breach increases uncertainty about the firms future performance, the lender is more likely to shorten loan maturity and reduce loan size 23  to breached firms. Columns (3) and (4) present the results for Loan Maturity and Loan Size, respectively. For loan maturity, the coefficient on Treat*Post is negative and significant in one of three specifications. While loan purpose and loan type play a significant role in loan maturity, the lack of consistent results does not allow definitive conclusions to be made regarding loan maturity. For loan size, the coefficient on Treat*Post is negative across specifications, suggesting lenders are more likely to protect themselves by reducing the size of loans for borrowers experiencing a breach. Taken together, the results provide support for an increase in lender monitoring and an increase in the credit riskiness of breached firms through performance pricing and loan size. Finally, prior literature finds covenants are an important aspect of debt contracting. I follow Bradley and Roberts (2015) and examine the number of financial covenants in each loan contract.15 Column (5), reports the results for Financial Covenants. Across specifications, there is no statistically significant difference between treatment and control firms in the pre and post breach periods. This evidence is consistent with cybersecurity breaches not being a signal of poor financial reporting quality as the usefulness of financial covenants does not change for breached firms.  V. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES Characteristics of Cybersecurity Breaches The primary analyses treat breaches as homogeneous. This section presents evidence on the variation in breaches (i.e., nature, content, and magnitude) and the associated lender response. Using the classifications in Table 1, Panel B, I examine how the nature of the breach affects the cost of debt. Table 8, Panel A, presents the results. Column (1) presents the results for breaches where a loss of property (i.e., portable or stationary device, physical records) contains proprietary 15 Using the number of covenants is inherently limiting as it does not address the restrictive nature of the covenants. 24  information. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and significant (t statistic of 3.65). Column (2) examines breaches where proprietary data is unintentionally disclosed. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive but not significant (t statistic of 0.50). Column (3) presents the results for breaches involving third party infiltration. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and significant (t statistic of 3.47). Column (4) examines breaches related to employee deception. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive but not significant (t statistic of 1.58). Column (5) presents the results for breaches that cannot be readily classified because of a lack of information. The coefficient on Treat*Post is positive but not significant (t statistic of 0.61). Taken together, lenders appear to increase spreads when borrowers are negligent regarding protecting proprietary data.  I also examine whether the underlying content of the breach causes differences in the cost of debt. I bifurcate the sample into whether the breach involved customer or employee data. Panel B, Columns (1) and (2), reports the results. In breaches involving customer or employee information, the coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and significant (t statistics of 3.13 and 3.11, respectively). The difference in coefficients is not statistically significant, suggesting lenders respond similarly to breaches of customer and employee data. The lack of mandatory disclosure rules for breaches means there is insufficient information to classify the full sample for these content tests. Readers are cautioned therefore that the inferences from these tests may be limited. The magnitude of the breach varies substantially in the sample. The more extensive a breach is, the more likely a lender is to increase their monitoring efforts and to perceive the borrower as a greater credit risk because of increased uncertainty about the firms future performance. I measure the magnitude of the breach using two proxies: total records breached and press coverage around the breach. Panel C, Columns (1) and (2), presents the results for total records breached. I compare the top decile of total records breached (High Total Records) to other 25  breach events (Low Total Records). For the high and low subsamples, the coefficient on Treat*Post is positive. The difference in coefficients across the subsamples is significant.  Columns (3) and (4) provides the results for press coverage. Following Drake et al. (2014), I measure press coverage as news flashes and full articles in RavenPack with a relevance score greater than or equal to 90. I compare press coverage from the month before to the month after the breach. For the Increase in Press Coverage and Decrease or No Change in Press Coverage subsamples, the coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and significant. The difference in coefficients across the subsamples is marginally significant. Economically speaking, the estimated coefficient on Treat*Post for the Increase in Press Coverage subsample is approximately 2.0 times larger than for the Decrease or No Change in Press Coverage subsample. Overall, these results suggest lenders increase the cost of debt to a greater extent for firms experiencing larger data breaches, consistent with lenders responding to increases in uncertainty. Validation Tests Using Cross Sectional Analyses The primary results show on average associations between breaches and the cost of debt. In this section, I build upon those results and provide several validity tests. Specifically, I conduct cross sectional analyses related to firm risk, investment in controls, and cash flow expectations. Riskiness of the Firm I explore whether the magnitude of the association between cybersecurity breaches and the cost of debt is greatest for a borrower with a high credit risk prior to a breach. If a firm is considered a credit risk before a breach, I expect a breach to have a greater impact on the cost of debt. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 9 report the results. I partition the sample based on the credit rating prior to the breach. High (low) credit ratings are defined as firms with an S&P credit rating of A or above (below A). Consistent with expectation, the magnitude of the association between breaches and 26  the cost of debt is larger for firms with lower credit ratings in the pre period. Specifically, the coefficient on Treat*Post is positive and statistically significant in the low credit rating subsample and not statistically significant in the high credit rating subsample. A test for coefficient differences indicates the coefficient on Treat*Post is marginally statistically larger for the low credit rating subsample compared with the high credit rating subsample. This finding suggests breaches affect the cost of debt to a greater extent when firms are already identified as a credit risk. Underinvestment in Control Systems A maintained assumption in the paper is that breaches lead to an increase in the cost of debt because of an underinvestment in internal controls by the borrower. To provide evidence on the validity of this assumption, I construct a measure of investment in information technology (IT) using the auditors report on internal controls. IT investment is not observable and is not a disaggregated expense in the financial statements. However, auditors are required to understand how IT affects the business, including the effect on internal control (PCAOB AS 2; PCAOB AS5).  I partition the sample based on the existence of a prior year IT related material weakness or auditor identified IT risk related to a merger or acquisition.16 That is, high (low) underinvestment in control systems is defined as having (not having) an IT material weakness or a disclosed auditor identified IT risk. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 9 report the results. Consistent with the main argument, the magnitude of the association between breaches and the cost of debt is larger for firms with high underinvestment in control systems (i.e., higher IT risk). Treat*Post is positive and significant in both subsamples. However, the coefficient on Treat*Post is four times larger in the high underinvestment subsample relative to the low underinvestment subsample. A 16 The Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) allows the option of excluding current year acquisitions from internal control audits. 27  test for coefficient differences is statistically significant, suggesting firms with underinvestment in control systems experience a greater increase in the cost of debt after a breach. Expectations about Future Cash Flows A main argument in the paper is that cybersecurity breaches lead to an increase in the cost of debt because lenders change their expectations about borrowers future cash flows. If breaches are associated with significant changes in expectations, breaches are likely to have a greater impact on the cost of debt. Columns (5) and (6) of Table 9 report the results from this cross sectional test. To proxy for lenders changes in expectations, I partition the sample based on the five month change in cost of equity detailed in the Cybersecurity and Cost of Equity Section. A high change in expectations about future cash flows is defined as firms in the top decile of the cost of equity. A low change in expectations is defined as firms with a decrease in the cost of equity. Consistent with expectation, the magnitude of the association between breaches and the cost of debt is larger for firms with a higher change in expectations. A test for coefficient differences across the subsamples indicates the coefficient on Treat*Post is statistically larger for the high change subsample compared with the low change subsample.17 This result suggests breaches affect the cost of debt to a greater extent when there is a significant change in expectations. Persistence of the Cost of Debt Effect The key finding in this study is that a breach is an informative signal for lenders and is associated with an increase in the cost of debt. While this finding is significant in terms of understanding costs associated with breaches, it is unclear whether lenders treat breaches as temporary or persistent increases in monitoring costs and credit risk. To examine persistence, I 17 Results using the one month and three month cost of equity measures show a similar pattern in coefficients with Treat*Post being larger in the high change subsample. However, the difference in coefficients is not significant. 28  alter Equation (2) and separate loans initiated in the year immediately following a breach, when the event is likely to be more salient to the lender, from other loans initiated later in the post period: ������������������������������������������������������������������������ = ������������0 + ������������1������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ 1 + ������������2������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ 2 + ������������3������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ 3 + ������������4������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ 4 + ������������5������������������������������������������������ ������������������������ 5 + ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ + ������������.  (3)  Loan Yr 1 is an indicator variable set equal to one if the treatment firm initiated the loan in the year following the breach, and zero otherwise. I also examine the effect of loans originated after the first year by including indicator variables for loans originated in the second (Loan Yr 2), third (Loan Yr 3), fourth (Loan Yr 4), or fifth (Loan Yr 5) year following a breach. If the breach has a persistent effect on loan spread, the coefficient on these additional years will be positive. Table 10 provides the results. Consistent with the finding that breaches trigger an increase in the cost of debt, the coefficient on Loan Yr 1 is positive and significant across specifications, providing additional support for Hypothesis 1. Interestingly, the coefficients on Loan Yr 2, Loan Yr 3, Loan Yr 4, and Loan Yr 5 are not significant, suggesting lenders perceive the additional monitoring costs and credit risk as mitigated after one year following a breach.18 Private Information Acquisition Prior theoretical and empirical research examines the premise that lenders price debt based on private information. It is difficult to determine how borrowers communicate private information to lenders. To examine the level of private information lenders have regarding breaches, I examine whether pre breach loans demonstrate an increase in the price of debt relative to loans initiated in the post period. In the spirit of Chen et al. (2016), I modify Equation (3) and add a new variable, Before Breach, which is an indicator variable equal to one if the loan is initiated in the year before 18 The lack of a persistent effect for loan spreads contrasts with the findings in Kamiya et al. (2020) that credit ratings are negatively affected up to two years after a breach. One explanation is there is greater power in the credit ratings tests because the rating is available annually whereas loans are only available upon origination. An alternative explanation is lenders receive better information about the breach (e.g., the extent, the costs) that may occur over time as the manager chooses to disclose such information. 29  the breach. If the lender obtains information about the breach before public revelation, Before Breach should have a positive coefficient. Table 11 shows Before Breach is negative across specifications, suggesting lenders do not receive private information with respect to a breach. Sensitivity Tests for Sample Composition While the main analysis uses a size and industry matched sample, this design methodology may not sufficiently control for the propensity to experience a breach. To address this concern, I reperform the main analysis using a propensity score matched (PSM) sample. The PSM sample uses the significant determinants in Equation (1) to compute a propensity of firms to experience a breach.19 Each treatment observation is matched without replacement to a control observation in the same year with the closest propensity score within a maximum distance of 5 percent. To ensure treatment and control samples are similar across all observable dimensions except for the treatment effect, I examine the results of the propensity score matching in Table 12, Panel A. The pseudo R squared is 0.217 and the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.815. The ROC curve suggests the model variables (MVE, Firm Age, Loss, Complexity, Acquisitions, and Sales Growth) have relatively high explanatory power for distinguishing between observations that do and do not experience a breach (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2002). Table 12, Panel A, also presents differences between the PSM treatment and control firms for the various determinants. There are no statistically significant differences.  Table 12, Panel B, presents the results of Equation (2) using the PSM sample. Across all model specifications, the difference in difference estimator, Treat*Post, continues to be positive 19 I am unable to include Analyst Following in the propensity model as the number of treatment firms drops significantly after matching with DealScan. To ensure the propensity model provides sufficient explanatory power, I compare the difference in the pseudo R squared with and without the Analyst Following variable. Including Analyst Following increases the pseudo R squared to 0.249 from 0.217. 30  and statistically significant. These results suggest breached firms experience an increase in the cost of debt relative to control firms with a similar propensity to experience a breach. Relation between Cybersecurity Breaches and Material Weaknesses While I posit that breaches signal a lack of controls over proprietary data, it is possible breaches relate to other internal control issues at the firm. Kim et al. (2011) and Costello and Wittenberg Moerman (2011) find firms with material weaknesses have higher costs of debt. Doyle et al. (2007) show firms with material weaknesses are generally smaller and younger, suggesting firms disclosing material weaknesses are generally not the same firms experiencing breaches.  Table 13 provides the correlations between breaches and material weaknesses. For prior year material weaknesses in ICFR (i.e., SOX 404) and in disclosure controls (i.e., SOX 302), the correlations are negative and significant. For current year material weaknesses, the correlations are insignificant. These results indicate breaches differ from other financial reporting quality measures (see Section II). To ensure the robustness of results, I exclude material weakness firms from the sample and reperform the analyses. Treat*Post continues to be positive and significant. Differences in Managerial Ability An alternative explanation for my findings is that innate differences in managerial ability influence firm performance and cause a lack of investment in cybersecurity. While the empirical analyses include controls for firm performance and Section V addresses a lack of investment in control systems, I attempt to rule out this alternative explanation and ensure breaches have an incremental association (i.e., beyond a latent managerial problem) with the cost of debt, number of lenders, and non interest loan terms. Following Demerjian et al. (2012), I control for managerial ability. Results (untabulated) continue to hold and inferences are unchanged. Cybersecurity and the Cost of Public Debt 31  While the primary analyses focus on how breaches impact new issuances of private debt, it is possible breaches affect existing public debt issuances. To examine this possibility, I use bond issuance data from the Fixed Income Security Database (FISD). Following Bessembinder et al. (2008), I eliminate puttable, convertible, and zero coupon bonds. I require nonmissing information on bond rating, issue size, offering price, and maturity date. To reduce the impact of poor firm performance on bond returns, I focus the analysis on investment grade bonds. To calculate the bond return, I require price data from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). Using short window tests, I measure returns with a clean price approach:  ������������������������������������������������ ������������������������������������������������������������������������ = ������������������������−������������������������−1 ������������������������−1 , where P is the price of the bond. Abnormal bond return (ABR) is the difference between the observed bond return and the expected return. The expected bond return is constructed using matching portfolios based on Moodys six major rating categories (i.e., Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, Ba, and B). Because I use daily price data and many bonds do not trade on a daily basis, I do not further partition the matching portfolios. I calculate the abnormal bond return over two windows: ten days before to ten days after the breach (t 10 to t+10), and ten days before to 30 days after the breach (t 10 to t+30). The sample for this analysis includes 747 bond observations.  In untabulated analysis, the mean ABR ( 10, +10) is 0.010 percent (p value of 0.153) and the mean ABR ( 10, +30) is 0.163 percent (p value of 0.035), suggesting bondholders negatively react to breaches. The small sample and inherent estimation difficulties (e.g., bonds trade less frequently than equities) limit the inferences that can be drawn from these tests. Cybersecurity and the Cost of Equity Finance theory has explored the inherent conflicts between debt and equity holders. The argument for whether a breach influences the cost of debt raises questions about whether a breach 32  simultaneously influences the cost of equity. To test this conjecture, I follow Hribar and Jenkins (2004) and employ an event study approach. The relative percentage changes in the cost of equity are measured one, three, and five months after the breach, where the baseline cost of equity is measured one month prior to the breach. A short window test allows the use of the firm as its own control, reducing the likelihood that omitted variables affect changes in the cost of equity.  To calculate the cost of equity capital, I use estimates from Easton (2004) based on the price earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Consistent with Callahan et al. (2012), I assume dividends per share are zero, which allows for a closed form solution to the model: ������������������������ = ������������������������������������2−������������������������������������1 ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ 2 , where ������������������������is stock price at time t, eps2 is the mean two year ahead earnings per share forecast, eps1 is the mean one year ahead earnings per share forecast, and REASTON is the cost of equity capital. I use data from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S), Compustat, and the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). The sample includes 875 observations. The average increases in the cost of equity capital one month after the breach are 5.0 percent, three months after the breach are 7.4 percent, and five months after the breach are 7.2 percent (untabulated).  I also examine cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for the 3 day window surrounding the breach disclosure. Returns are calculated by subtracting from individual firm daily returns the concurrent equally weighted market return for firms in the same market capitalization decile. The mean CAR around the breach is 0.316 percent (p value of 0.004), which is similar to results in concurrent work by Hilary et al. (2016). Overall, this evidence is consistent with increases in uncertainty persisting in the short run for firms following a breach.  VI. CONCLUSION 33  Advances in technology have substantially improved the processing and communication capability of firms (Shapiro and Varian 1998). Yet, firms growing reliance upon technology generated information increases their exposure to risks associated with technology and information retention. This study provides evidence on cybersecurity risks faced by firms and how capital market participants respond to realizations of those risks. I find breaches are more likely for firms that are larger, more visible to the public, less financially healthy, and more complex. To understand the capital market implications of breaches, I examine various dimensions of loan contracts that may be affected by the increased uncertainty arising from breaches, including loan spread, lender structure, and several non interest loan terms. I hypothesize and find that breached firms face increasing costs of debt capital, a decrease in the number of lenders willing to supply capital, a decrease in loan size, and an increase the use of performance pricing. I also examine the effect of breaches on bondholders and shareholders. I find evidence of a negative bond market reaction and a negative equity market reaction. Taken together, the findings suggest cybersecurity breaches have information content for stakeholders.  This study lies at the intersection of the debt contracting and risk management literatures with a focus on cybersecurity risk. I contribute to these literatures by providing evidence that breaches have real economic consequences (i.e., increased financing costs). These findings also inform the recent debate regarding cybersecurity breach disclosure obligations. The SEC argues that firms need to invest more to manage cybersecurity risk. By documenting breached firms face increasing costs of capital, this study points to an additional benefit of investment in cybersecurity that should be considered in the disclosure debate.  34  APPENDIX A: Variable Definitions  The appendix presents definitions of variables in Equations (2) and (3). All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. Variable names Variable definitions Dependent Variables Spread Loan spread is measured as the all in spread drawn from the DealScan database. The all in spread drawn is calculated as the amount the borrower pays in basis points over LIBOR for each dollar drawn down. DealScan adds the borrowing spread of the loan over LIBOR with any annual (or facility) fee paid.  Number of Lenders Total number of lenders involved in a single loan.  Security Indicator variable equal to one if the loan requires collateral, zero otherwise.  Financial Covenants  Total number of financial covenants in the debt agreement, following Bradley and Roberts (2015).  Performance Pricing Indicator variable equal to one if the loan facility utilizes performance pricing (e.g., firms credit rating, firms financial ratios), zero otherwise.  Variables of Interest Treat Indicator variable equal to one if the firm experiences a cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Post Indicator variable equal to one if the loan is originated after disclosure of the breach or the assigned pseudo breach date, zero otherwise.  Loan Yr 1 Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the year following the cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Loan Yr 2 Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the second year following the cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Loan Yr 3 Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the third year following the cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Loan Yr 4 Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the fourth year following the cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Loan Yr 5 Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the fifth year following the cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  Before Breach Indicator variable equal to one if the treatment firm initiates a loan in the year prior to a cybersecurity breach, zero otherwise.  35  Variable names Variable definitions Firm specific Control Variables Size Size is the natural logarithm of total assets [AT].  MTB Market value of equity, scaled by book value [PRCC_F*CSHO/CEQ].  Leverage Long term debt plus debt in current liabilities, scaled by total assets [(DLTT+DLC)/AT].  Profitability Operating income before depreciation, scaled by total assets [OIBDP/AT].  Tangibility Net property, plant, and equipment, scaled by total assets [PPENT/AT].  Cash Flow Volatility Cash flow volatility is the natural logarithm of the standard deviation of the change in quarterly cash flows from operations over the four fiscal years prior to the loan. Default Risk Altmans (1968) Z score is calculated as follows:  1.2*(WCAP/AT) + 1.4*(RE/AT) + 3.3*(EBIT/AT) + 0.6*(PRCC_F*CSHO/LT) + 0.999*(SALE/AT).  Loan specific Control Variables Loan Maturity Loan maturity is the natural logarithm of the loan maturity measured in months.  Loan Size Loan size is the natural logarithm of the loan facility amount measured in millions of dollars.  Loan Type Indicators Indicator variables for the various loan types in DealScan. The loan types include: term loans, revolvers and lines of credit greater than one year, revolvers and lines of credit less than one year, and 364 day facilities.  Loan Purpose Indicators Indicator variables for the various loan purposes in DealScan. Following Strahan (1999), the loan purposes indicators are defined by the following categories: general corporate purposes, leverage buyouts, recapitalization, asset acquisition, takeovers, working capital, and debt restructuring.  Macroeconomic Control Variables Credit Spread Credit spread is the difference in the yield between the AAA and BAA corporate bonds, obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Term Spread Term spread is the difference in the yield between the 10 year and 2 year Treasury bonds, obtained from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  36  APPENDIX B: Examples of Cybersecurity Breaches  The appendix provides examples of cybersecurity breaches used in the sample.

Cybersecurity breaches are obtained from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Firms are manually matched to the CRSP Compustat universe. Firms are then linked to the DealScan database using the matching table provided by Chava and Roberts (2008). Panel A outlines the sample selection procedures. Panel B provides the number and frequency of observations based on the nature of the breach. Panel C reports the number and frequency of observations by year. Panel D presents the number and frequency of observations by industry.

To provide a greater understanding of firms experiencing data breaches, this table compares breached firms to non breached Compustat and DealScan samples of firms. MVE is calculated as the natural logarithm of share price multiplied the number of shares outstanding. Firm Age is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of years the firm has been listed on Compustat. Analyst Following is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of analysts following the firm based on I/B/E/S. Annual Press Coverage is a count of the number of business press articles during the prior year, using RavenPack articles with a relevance score greater than or equal to 90. Loss is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm experiences a loss, defined as having negative income before extraordinary items, in year t or t 1. Complexity is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of geographic and operating segments. Foreign Ops is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm reports non missing pre tax income from foreign operations, and zero otherwise. Acquisitions is calculated as the acquisition value scaled by the market value of equity. Sales Growth is calculated as the percentage of sales growth from year t 1 to year t. Continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to mitigate outliers.

The dependent variable is Treat, which is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm experiences a cybersecurity breach, and zero otherwise. MVE is calculated as the natural logarithm of share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Firm Age is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of years the firm has been listed on Compustat. Analyst Following is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of analysts following the firm based on I/B/E/S. Annual Press Coverage is a count of the number of business press articles during the prior year, using RavenPack articles with a relevance score greater than or equal to 90. Loss is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm experiences a loss, defined as having negative income before extraordinary items, in year t or t 1. Complexity is measured as the natural logarithm of the number of geographic and operating segments. Foreign Ops is an indicator variable set equal to one if the firm reports non missing pre tax income from foreign operations, and zero otherwise. Acquisitions is calculated as the acquisition value in year t, scaled by the market value of equity. Sales Growth is calculated as the percentage of sales growth from year t 1 to year t. The constant is unreported. Continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to mitigate outliers. Regressions include industry and year fixed effects. Wald Chi squared statistics are reported in parentheses and are calculated based on standard errors obtained by clustering at the firm level. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

27,"Rapid7, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20137661-308069.pdf,"Comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission Re: Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure RIN 3235 AM89 August 29, 2022 Rapid7, Inc. (Rapid7 or we) met with staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 9, 2022 to discuss our feedback regarding the SECs proposed rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and DIsclosure. These comments 1 reﬂect the feedback that Rapid7 provided to the SEC during that meeting. We greatly appreciate the SECs openness to our input and consideration of these comments. Rapid7 supports many aspects of the proposed rule. Cybersecurity is of growing importance to modern corporate governance, risk assessment, and other key factors that stockholders weigh when making an investment decision. We agree with the SEC that a public companys cyber risk management posture, governance, and incident handling capabilities are appropriate factors that investors and other stakeholders should consider, and believe that the proposed rule advances this principle. However, Rapid7 has serious concerns about the potential negative ramiﬁcations of the public disclosure of uncontained or unmitigated cyber incidents. The below comments explain why we believe public disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents prior to containment or mitigation may lead to the mispricing of securities and cause greater harm to investors than a delay in public disclosure. We also recommend an exception to the proposed rule that would enable a company to delay public disclosure of an uncontained or unmitigated incident if certain conditions are met. Additionally, we explain why we believe other proposed solutions may not meet the SECs goals of transparency and avoidance of harm to investors. Premature public disclosure of cyber incidents puts investors at risk Although Rapid7 generally supports cyber incident reporting, the SECs proposed rule is distinguished from nearly all other incident reporting requirements by making the report 1 Securities and Exchange Commission, Proposed Rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590, Mar. 23, 2022. 1 publicly available within a short timeframe. Crucially, the SECs proposed rule makes no 2 distinction between public disclosure of incidents that are contained or mitigated and incidents that are not yet contained or mitigated. The proposed rule would require publicly traded 3 companies to report cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K within four days of determining that the incident is material, and the 8 K report would become publicly available via the EDGAR system. When the information is public, it becomes accessible to attackers as well as 4 investors. Public disclosure of an unmitigated or uncontained cyber incident will likely lead to attacker behaviors that cause additional harm to investors. Cybercriminals often aim to embed themselves in corporate networks without the company knowing in order to steal data over time and steadily gain greater access across networks  sometimes over a period of years. But when an attacker knows it has been discovered, this can lead to reactions that cause additional harm if the attack has not yet been contained or mitigated. Speciﬁc risks to investors from premature public disclosure include ● Escalated attack: A discovered attacker may forgo stealth and accelerate data theft or extortion activities, causing more harm to the company and its investors. Consider this passage from the MS ISACs 2020 Ransomware Guide: Be sure [to] avoid tipping off actors that they have been discovered and that mitigation actions are being undertaken. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their access [or] deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken oﬄine.5 ● Anti forensic activity: A discovered attacker may engage in anti forensic activity (such as deleting logs), hindering post incident investigations and intelligence sharing that could prevent future attacks that harm investors. As noted in CISAs Incident Response Playbook: Some adversaries may actively monitor defensive response measures and shift their methods to evade detection and containment.6 6 CISA, Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks, pg. 14, Nov. 2021, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerabi lity_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf. 5 Multi State Information Sharing & Analysis Center, Ransomware Guide, pg. 11, Sep. 2020, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/publications/CISA_MS ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C_.pdf. 4 87 Fed. Reg. 16595, 16603. Foreign private issuers would ﬁle on Form 6 K. 87 Fed. Reg. 16597. 3 In general, the objective of containment activities is to prevent a cyber incident from spreading. Containment is part of mitigation, which includes actions to reduce the severity of an event or the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, though may fall short of full remediation. See CISA, Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks, pg. 14, Nov. 2021, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerabi lity_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf. 2 Rapid7, Cyber Incident Reporting Regulations Summary and Chart, Aug. 26, 2022, https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/08/26/incident reporting regulations summary and chart. 2 ● Copycat attacks: Announcing that a company has an incident may cause other attackers to probe the company and discover the vulnerability or attack vector from the original incident. If the incident is not yet mitigated, the copycat attackers can cause further harm to the company and its investors. From the CERT Guide to Coordinated Disclosure:  [M]ere knowledge of a vulnerabilitys existence in a feature of some product is suﬃcient for a skillful person to discover it for themselves. Rumor of a vulnerability draws attention from knowledgeable people with vulnerability ﬁnding skills[.]7 ● Copycat attacks on other companies: Public disclosure of an unmitigated cybersecurity incident may alert attackers to a vulnerability that is present in other companies, the exploitation of which can harm investors in those other companies. Publicly disclosing the nature and scope of material incidents within four business days risks exposing enough detail of an otherwise unique zero day vulnerability to encourage rediscovery and reimplementation by other criminal and espionage groups against other organizations. For example, fewer than 100 organizations were actually exploited 8 through the Solarwinds supply chain attack, but up to 18,000 organizations were at risk.9 Premature public disclosure of cyber incidents may misprice securities Several aspects of the SECs proposed rule are intended to help investors assess a registrant companys cybersecurity risk management posture and capabilities, which Rapid7 generally supports. If a registrant company has a mature cybersecurity program, it may aim to adhere 10 to best practices for cyber incident response. Established cyber incident response protocol is to avoid tipping off an attacker until the incident is contained and the risk of further damage has been mitigated, for the reasons described in the previous section. See, for example, 11 11 For similar reasons, it is commonly the goal of coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices to avoid, when possible, public disclosure of a vulnerability until the vulnerability has been mitigated. See, for example, the CERT Guide to Coordinated Disclosure, 5.7 Disclosure Timing, Sep. 16, 2019, https://vuls.cert.org/conﬂuence/display/CVD/5.7+Disclosure+Timing#id 5.7DisclosureTiming ReleasingPartialInf ormationCanHelpAdversaries. 10 See Subsection D.

If the registrant were able to follow best practices and ensure containment or 13 mitigation before public disclosure, it may prevent some of the additional harms that would arise from premature public disclosure. However, if the SECs proposed cyber rule requires public disclosure of uncontained or unmitigated cyber incidents, this could distort the price of securities. While adherence to cybersecurity best practices should be a positive inﬂuence on investors assessment of the appropriate value of the companys securities, the proposed rule would require companies to contradict best practices in some instances. By contradicting best practices for cyber incident response and inviting new attacks, the premature public disclosure of an uncontained or unmitigated incident may provide investors with an inaccurate measure of the registrant companys true ability to respond to cybersecurity incidents. Moreover, a premature disclosure during an early stage of the incident response process may result in investors receiving inaccurate information about the scope or impact of the incident. Proposed solution: A exception providing a delay in limited circumstances Rapid7 encourages the SEC to consider an alternative approach that achieves the SECs ultimate goal of investor protection by requiring timely disclosure of cyber incidents and simultaneously avoiding the unnecessary additional harm to investors that may result with premature disclosure. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that the proposed rule remains largely the same— i.e., the SEC continues to require that companies determine whether the incident is material as soon as practicable after discovery of the cyber incident, and ﬁle a report on Form 8 K four days after the materiality determination under normal circumstances. However, we suggest that the rule be revised to also provide companies with a temporary exemption from public disclosure if each of the below conditions are met: ● The incident is not yet contained or otherwise mitigated to prevent additional harm to the company and its investors; ● The company reasonably believes that public disclosure of the uncontained or unmitigated incident may cause substantial additional harm to the company, its investors, or other public companies or their investors; 13 NIST SP 800 61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, 2.3.4 Sharing Information With Outside Parties, pg. 9, Aug. 2012, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800 61r2.pdf. 12 CISA, Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks, pgs. 9 and 14, Nov. 2021, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerabi lity_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf. 4 ● The company reasonably believes the incident can be contained or mitigated in a timely manner; and ● The company is actively engaged in containing or mitigating the incident in a timely manner. The determination of the applicability of the aforementioned exception may be made simultaneously to the determination of materiality. If such determination is made, the company may delay public disclosure until such time that any of the conditions are no longer occurring, at which point, they must publicly disclose the cyber incident via Form 8 K, no later than four days after the date on which the exemption is no longer applicable. The 8 K disclosure could note that, prior to ﬁling the 8 K, the company relied on the exemption from disclosure. Existing insider trading restrictions would continue to apply during the public disclosure delay. If an open ended delay in public disclosure for containment or mitigation is unacceptable to the SEC, then we suggest that the exemption only be available for 30 days after the determination of materiality. In Rapid7s experience, the vast majority of incidents can be contained and mitigated within that time frame. However, cybersecurity incidents can vary greatly, and there may nonetheless be rare outliers where the mitigation process exceeds 30 days. Drawbacks of other solutions There are drawbacks to other solutions being ﬂoated to address the risks of premature public disclosure of unmitigated or uncontained cyber incidents. Some of these solutions do not align with the purpose of the SEC rule, while others dont adequately address the risks of premature public disclosure. For example: ● AG delay: The SECs proposed rule considers allowing a delay in reporting the incident when the Attorney General (AG) determines the delay is in the interest of national security. Rapid7 supports integrating this delay into the ﬁnal rule, but it is insuﬃcient 14 on its own. This AG delay would apply to a very small fraction of major cyber incidents and not prevent the potential harms described above in the vast majority of cases. ● Law enforcement delay: The SECs proposed rule considers, and then rejects, a delay when incident reporting would hinder a law enforcement investigation. Rapid7 15 supports integrating this delay into the ﬁnal rule as well, to ensure law enforcement can help prevent future cyber incidents that would harm investors. However, it is unclear if 15 87 Fed. Reg. 16596. 14 87 Fed. Reg. 16598. 5 this delay would be triggered in many cases. First, the SECs proposed timeframe (four days after concluding the incident is material) poses a tight turnaround for law enforcement to start a new investigation or add to an existing investigation, determine how disclosure might impact the investigation, and then request delay from the SEC. Second, law enforcement agencies already have investigations opened against many cybercriminal groups, and so public disclosure of another incident may not make a signiﬁcant difference in the investigation. Although a law enforcement delay would be used more than the AG delay, we still anticipate it would apply to only a fraction of incidents. ● Vague disclosures: Another potential solution is to continue to require public companies to disclose unmitigated cyber incidents on the proposed timeline, but to allow the disclosures to be so vague that it is unclear whether the incident has been mitigated. Yet an attacker embedded in a company network is unlikely to be fooled by a vague incident report from the same company, and even a vague report could encourage new attackers to try to get a foothold in. In addition, very vague disclosures are unlikely to be useful for investor decision making. ● Materiality after mitigation: Another potential solution is to require a materiality determination only after the incident has been mitigated. However, this risks unnecessary delays in mitigation to avoid triggering the deadline for disclosure, even for incidents that could be mitigated within the SECs proposed timeline. Although containment or mitigation of an incident is important prior to public disclosure of the incident, completion of mitigation is not necessarily a prerequisite to determining the seriousness of an incident. * * * The SEC has long been among the most forward looking regulators on cybersecurity issues. We applaud the SECs acknowledgement of the signiﬁcance of cybersecurity to corporate management, and for taking the time to listen to feedback from the community. Rapid7s feedback is that we agree on the usefulness of disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, but we encourage the SEC to ensure its public reporting requirement avoids undermining its own goals, harming investors, and providing more opportunities for attackers. We appreciate the opportunity to share our views.

28,Information Technology Industry Council,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20135850-306750.pdf,"Promoting Innovation Worldwide  ITI Follow Up Response to SEC re: Proposed Cyber Rule  ITI submitted comments responding to the SECs Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Disclosure on May 9, 2022. We subsequently met with SEC staff to discuss our perspectives. This document offers additional feedback on the Proposed Rule in follow up to that conversation. We appreciate the opportunity to continue to engage with the SEC on the Proposed Rule as it is imperative that the SEC continue to consider the potentially significant negative cybersecurity ramifications that could result from the rulemaking if it is not appropriately tailored. As an initial general point, some ITI members have urged to the SEC to provide additional guidance upon implementation of the rule regarding how to conduct a materiality analysis under this new disclosure requirement. Specifically, some ITI members asked for guidance on whether there are new factors to consider when evaluating any potential material future impacts on registrants operations and financial condition in the context of a cybersecurity incident; as well as the other points raised by ITI in section IV of our May 9, 2022 comments. Law Enforcement Exceptions/Delays  As we referenced in our initial comments, we believe that the Proposed Rule should include safe harbor provisions for law enforcement, national security, and cybersecurity interests. We also noted our concerns that any premature disclosure of vulnerability or incident related information would be inconsistent with industry best practices for security and may enable cyber criminals to levy an attack, further undermining the security posture of impacted parties, and the security of the nation and society more broadly. If the SEC chooses to maintain its approach, we continue to encourage it to allow for a delay in disclosing a cybersecurity incident when there is an active law enforcement investigation underway or when it is in the interest of national security. Language illustrating how to implement such exceptions can be found in state data breach laws, which permit companies to delay data breach notices when law enforcement determines that such notices will impede an investigation. We offered language from Californias data breach law as an example in our initial comments. Here, we also offer New Yorks language as a possible model, which states that the notification required by this section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that such notification impedes a criminal investigation. The notification required by this section shall be made after such law enforcement agency determines that such notification does not compromise such investigation.1 Requiring companies to disclose that an incident has occurred when there is ongoing law enforcement activity could compromise the integrity of such investigations through the public disclosure of sensitive information. For example, law enforcement was involved in investigating and recovering the ransom payment after the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. In this instance, a law enforcement delay would have been appropriate had the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicated that publicly disclosing the incident would hamper its investigation and subsequent recovery of the ransom funds that were paid by Colonial Pipeline. To that effect, Colonial Pipelines Chief Executive  1 See NY Data Breach language here: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/899 AA  2 Officer Joseph Blount testified before Congress that, I also want to now state publicly that we quietly and quickly worked with law enforcement in this matter from the start which may have helped lead to the substantial recovery of funds announced by the DOJ this week. It is possible that if Colonial Pipeline had been required to publicly disclose information regarding the incident prior to the conclusion of DOJs investigation, it would have hampered the DOJs ability to investigate and retrieve payment. As the SEC further hones the rulemaking, we encourage it to work with DOJ and the law enforcement community more broadly to fully understand how public disclosure can jeopardize an investigation and why a provision allowing for delay is a necessary and pragmatic measure. With regard to cybersecurity equities, if the SEC insists upon maintaining a four day disclosure window, then a delay should also be permitted to allow for the registrant to undertake appropriate mitigation and remediation activities to triage cybersecurity incidents and contain further potential damage to a registrants IT systems. Requiring public disclosure of an incident prior to mitigation measures being taken will serve to exacerbate cybersecurity incidents, enabling attackers to exploit such information, and could in fact, aggravate the cybersecurity impacts of the incident  not just for the impacted party but the broader ecosystem. We share more information below on why the rule should take care to avoid such results. Public Disclosures of Unremediated Vulnerabilities and Cyber Risk Management Practices  Malicious cyber actors are becoming more proficient at and quick to exploit known vulnerabilities. This includes vulnerabilities with available patches due to the length of time some entities take to fully remediate the vulnerable technologies or networks. Indeed, subsequent to the Equifax breach, attackers continued to attempt to exploit the underlying vulnerability that led to the breach.2 In July 2021, CISA published an Alert on Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities, indicating that malicious cyber actors routinely exploited disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched systems.3 This underscores the point that disclosing unremediated incidents or unpatched vulnerabilities can quickly invite other attackers to use that information to exploit other victims. This is why best practices for security and international standards for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, endorsed by Congress and CISA, emphasize that any premature disclosure of vulnerability information is inappropriate, and information should be kept in confidence until the release of the mitigation to the public in order to reduce risk for harm for society and ability of attackers to leverage this information.4 Threat actors are adept at penetrating networks and scanning the infrastructure for known vulnerabilities and often use automated tooling to accomplish this. Additionally, an increasing number of attacks now begin with a zero day exploitation.5 Therefore, public disclosure of a zero day by one company can in turn, harm other companies that may be using the same software, as referenced above. Once notified of the vulnerability, any hacker can commence an attack, so if the  2 https://www.wired.com/story/equifax breach no excuse/  3 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21 209a  4 See ISO/IEC 30111, 29147, The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 and CISA BOD 20 01.  5 A zero day is a computer software vulnerability, or flaw, that can be exploited before the developer has the opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability.  3 vulnerability is disclosed prior to remediation, the registrant, as well as others with the same vulnerability, could be subjected to a targeted attack that exploits the same vulnerability. This is an especially acute concern with sophisticated and well resourced threat actors, such as those tied to nation states and or other Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), as these threat actors are well positioned to exploit such vulnerabilities, often leading to cascading and devastating impacts for national security and the entire ecosystem. If a registrant was required to disclose a vulnerability publicly before having a patch, it could serve to facilitate the compromise of a much larger swatch of entities beyond just the registrant. Publicly disclosing an unremediated vulnerability is like publicly announcing that the lock on your back door does not work  you effectively put burglars on notice and provide them an invitation into your house to take what they want  except that you are also saying that hundreds or thousands of other houses may also be unlocked. Indeed, this sort of approach would stand in direct conflict with globally recognized standards and security best practices for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, which are followed by the technology ecosystem and governments globally. Log4j offers a good example of continued exploits of a vulnerability. Exploits started to happen before mitigation was undertaken due to the fact that the unremediated vulnerability was public. See below a timeline of events:  • 2021 11 24 Issue discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team and reported to the Apache Software Foundation. • 2021 12 01 Earliest known exploit attempt 2021 12 01 04:36:50 UTC reported by CloudFlare • 2021 12 06 Log4j released version 2.15.0, which mitigates the known attack vectors at the time • 2021 12 09 Issue was made public on Twitter • 2021 12 10 CVE 2021 44228 published, Apache log4j Security Page updated. The world starts patching, and begins to realize the significance of this issue  Public disclosure prior to mitigation may incentivize an attacker to accelerate anti forensic activity (such as deleting logs to avoid further detection and hamper incident responders) escalate their attack, invite other threat actors to exploit an acknowledged unmitigated vulnerability, or signal the existence of a widespread vulnerability that could impact many other organizations. In many instances, the negative impact of these attacker activities to investors clearly outweighs the positive impact of additional transparency from disclosing an unmitigated incident. The SEC should also consider the impact of disclosure on other parties as well as national security. The registrant is unlikely to have complete information as to how disclosure of such information will impact other parties, given the nature and sensitivity of incident information and the ability of attackers to exploit it. Indeed, the report released by the Cyber Safety Review Board on Log4J emphasized the need to avoid premature disclosure and follow best practices and international standards for coordinated vulnerability disclosure.6  6 CSRB Review of the December 2021 Log4j Event available here: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CSRB Report on Log4 July 11 2022_508.pdf   4 Concerns Regarding the Four Day Disclosure Window  We went into significant depth with our concerns related to the four day post materiality assessment disclosure window in our initial comments. However, we have reiterated several of our concerns here, and also offer some additional thoughts on the issue of appropriate timelines, as well as an example to illustrate some of our concerns. Although a company may be able to make a materiality determination and subsequently disclose within four business days, in many cases a registrant will not have the information necessary to make a meaningful disclosure that is valuable to investors within that time period. Cybersecurity incidents can take many months to investigate, with forensic analysis producing new information that likely alters factors relevant to the incidents technical and cybersecurity significance and broader business impacts. An illustrative example of a security incident that when examined in its totality was certainly significant, but when examined on a company by company basis would have in some cases been determined as material, and in some cases, not material, involves the SolarWinds breach. The SolarWinds supply chain compromise is considered one of the largest cybersecurity incidents as it involved the compromise of a third party vendor with access to the networks of its customers. In this case, SolarWinds Orion software was used by approximately 30,000 organizations to manage their IT networks. The hackers were able to inject a backdoor containing malicious code into a software update that potentially exposed any SolarWinds customers who downloaded the Orion software containing the malicious code. It has been reported that roughly 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the malicious updates, with the malware spreading undetected for months to a year or more.7 Reports indicate that hackers ultimately chose to access fewer than 100 networks. Two important questions are raised by the SolarWinds hack that are directly relevant to the 4 day disclosure timeline, as well as a point ITI raised in our initial submission regarding the likelihood of vast overreporting under the proposed rule. First, which companies involved in the SolarWinds breach should have been required to report that they suffered a material breach under the SECs current rule? Second, when would it be appropriate for those companies to make such a disclosure? It makes sense to address the when question first. Below is a timeline of the SolarWinds hack: • September 2019. Threat actors gain unauthorized access to SolarWinds network  • October 2019. Threat actors test initial code injection for Orion  • Feb. 20, 2020. Malicious code known as Sunburst injected into Orion  • March 26, 2020. SolarWinds unknowingly starts sending out Orion software updates with hacked code  • December 2020. Existence of SolarWinds breach is first detected, by the security company FireEye.  7 SolarWinds SEC filings available here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1739942/000162828020017451/swi 20201214.htm   5 It is noteworthy that FireEyes discovery of the breach occurred approximately 15 months after hackers initial compromise of SolarWinds. As mentioned above, approximately 100 other entities (government agencies and companies) did in fact discover that hackers had used the Orion backdoor to access their systems. But each of those 100 companies discovered their breaches at different times. As indicated by the above timeline, all 30,000 SolarWinds Orion customers were potentially at risk of being compromised as of September 2019, or at least October 2019. It would have been unreasonable to expect those companies to conduct a materiality assessment and then disclose anything at that point. What about in March 2020, when SolarWinds started sending out Orion software updates with malicious code to its customers? Were those customers breached then, and should they have been required to conduct a materiality assessment and disclose? In our view, the answer would be no since they were not aware of the malicious software update at that point. What about in December 2020, when the breach was discovered by FireEye, and was widely reported as one of the worst ever in the news shortly thereafter?  The SolarWinds incident helps illustrate why constructing any bright lines around when to disclose is counterproductive, including to potentially limit the time afforded a company to make a materiality determination in the first place, as some commenters have apparently advocated for and which we strongly advocate against. It also helps illustrate  particularly in the context of a large scale, widely publicized incident such as SolarWinds why SEC staff has perhaps sometimes read about a company potentially being victimized by an incident in the news well prior to receiving a disclosure filing from that company, if it ever receives one at all. For instance, there were numerous articles published in the wake of the SolarWinds breach suggesting that hundreds of high profile companies, as well as government agencies, were potentially victimized by the SolarWinds hack who in fact were not.8 SolarWinds is a good reminder that newsworthiness is not a reliable indicator of materiality. The which or who question is arguably even more important. Which entities should have been required to disclose the SolarWinds hack when ultimately it was found that less than 100 had actually been compromised, and when? It seems obvious SolarWinds should have disclosed as soon as they became aware of the breach, but what about their customers? Should all of SolarWinds 30,000 Orion software users have disclosed? The 18,000 who downloaded the updates with malicious code? The 100 or so companies whose systems the hackers actually accessed through the maliciously installed backdoors? Or a subset of those companies who determined the breach of their systems was actually material? The answer to which companies should have been required to disclose and the series of rhetorical questions posed above of course turns on if and when those companies determined that the SolarWinds breach was material to them and their investors. If using SolarWinds as a hypothetical case for application of the Proposed Rule, it is important that the SEC recognize that each company would have likely made such a determination at a different point in time, and also that once they publicly disclosed the fact that they were breached, they would have alerted both the SolarWinds hackers as well as other potential hackers that they had a backdoor installed on their system that could potentially be hacked. Not only would a hundred or more disclosures  8 See, e.g., Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit, New York Times, Dec. 14, 2020. Retrieved at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia hack nsa homeland security pentagon.html  6 flooding the EDGAR system not have been helpful to investors, but they would potentially have exposed these companies to further hacks utilizing the information they had just disclosed. SolarWinds provides an instructive example of both why imposing any type of hard timeline for public disclosure is dangerous in terms of potential cybersecurity exposure and can lead to over notification that would not meaningfully help investors. As we reference above, it is possible that the company makes a materiality determination at a stage when publicly disclosing the incident could further undermine cybersecurity because the incident has not yet been mitigated or remediated. Please see above, where we discuss the tactics of attackers, and how they can utilize unpatched vulnerabilities to attack a larger swath of companies beyond the immediately impact registrant. As such, there must be exceptions to disclosing unremediated cybersecurity incidents. With regard to cybersecurity equities, if the SEC insists upon maintaining a four day disclosure window, then a delay should also be permitted to allow for the registrant to undertake appropriate mitigation and remediation activities to triage cybersecurity incidents and contain further potential damage to a registrants IT systems. Please also see above, where we discuss this further.  If a timeline must be included in a Proposed Rule, compliance teams within our member companies have indicated that disclosures should be made without undue delay rather than including a specific number of days in which a disclosure must be made. This would be more appropriate and feasible.",3

This letter, which supplements our comment letter dated May 9, 2022,1 follows a meeting between members of the Societys Securities Law Committee and representatives of the staff of the SECs Division of Corporation Finance on June 2, 2022. In particular, this letter responds to the staffs expression of interest in receiving empirical information on investor requests for cybersecurity information from companies as well as potential alternatives to the proposed Form 8 K incident disclosure requirement. We appreciate the Commissions attention to this additional commentary.  1 Society for Corporate Governance, Comment Letter on Proposed Rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (May 9, 2022).  2  I. Society Survey Reveals That Few Investors Request Cybersecurity Details from Companies  A. Investors Do Not Seek Granular Details Required by Proposed Rule As Society members expressed to staff in the June meeting, institutional investors do not seek the granularity of information from companies that the Proposed Rule would require. In a recent survey of the Societys issuer members,2 only around 10 20% of the 192 respondents reported that their shareholders have requested information or asked a question on the following cybersecurity related information:  • The process by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks (20.3%) • Whether and how the board or committee considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, risk management, or financial oversight (18.9%) • Activities the company takes to prevent, detect, or minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents (17.5%) • The frequency of the boards discussion of cybersecurity risks (15.4%) • Information about the directors experience in cybersecurity (14.3%) • A description of the companys cybersecurity risk assessment program (11.2%) • Information about the specific management positions or committees responsible for cybersecurity risk (10.5%) • How cybersecurity risks are considered as part of business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation (8.4%) • A description of the companys policies and procedures for identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats (7%) • Policies and procedures to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with the use of any third party service provider (4.2%)  2 Society for Corporate Governance, Survey: Cybersecurity: Investor Priorities (June July 2022) (on file with author). Respondent demographics consisted of 56.3% mega and large cap issuers ($10 billion or larger market cap); 31.3% mid caps ($2 billion to $10 billion in market cap); and 12.5% small and micro caps (less than $2 billion). The companies spanned a wide variety of industries, with the top six sectors represented being Manufacturing  Industrial (11.3%), Banking/Finance (14.6%), Energy (7%), Retail/Wholesale (8.1%), Healthcare/Pharma (5.4%), and Technology (13%). The survey generated 192 responses over a four week period in June and July 2022. 3  • The process by which management personnel are informed about cybersecurity risks (4.2%) • The use of assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program (3.5%) • Information about the companys chief information security officer, or the equivalent (3.7%) • How previous cybersecurity incidents have informed changes in governance, policies and procedures, or technologies (1.4%) • The existence of previously undisclosed individually immaterial incidents that, if aggregated, would be material (0.0%). Overall, 64.3% of the respondents indicated that their investors had not engaged with them on any of the listed topics.  The survey results indicate that, even for the minority of companies engaged by their shareholders on these topics, investors have not requested the granularity of disclosures that would be required under the Proposed Rule. Requests for detailed information regarding the boards oversight, including its role in overseeing the management of cybersecurity risks, along the lines contemplated by the Proposed Rule, are anomalous. As one respondent described their companys experience: Investors dont typically ask questions that specifically  they ask generally about how the board oversees cybersecurity risk, and generally how management handles cybersecurity risk management  some conversations may go to third party assessment (both third parties used to do our internal assessments, and our assessment of third party risk). That additional level of detail is very rare  the questions are much more high level and focused on whether the board is paying attention to cybersecurity risk as part of the suite of risks it oversees. The Commissions 2018 cybersecurity guidance already provides that, for companies where cybersecurity risk is material, Item 407(h) of Regulation S K and Item 7 of Schedule 14A regarding board oversight of risk should include a description of the boards management of cybersecurity risk. Based on our member input, bolstered by these recent survey results, we believe that the existing Item 407(h) of Regulation S K and Item 7 of Schedule 14A are sufficient to elicit the desired disclosure.  If the SEC nevertheless pursues additional disclosure requirements, we request that in lieu of the detailed, prescriptive requirements proposed, the final rule be modified to a include a list of categories for disclosure. For example, the SEC could amend the current risk and governance disclosure requirements in Regulation S K to add language to indicate that cyber  4  related information must be disclosed. Specifically, the SEC could amend Item 407(h) to expressly require disclosure of the board of directors oversight of cybersecurity related risk.  Also noteworthy is that our 192 survey respondents reported that no investors requested information about aggregated incidents, an aspect of the Proposed Rule that our initial letter noted would be difficult for issuers to understand and implement, and of limited value to investors. B. Respondents Express Concerns About Proposed Incident Disclosure We also surveyed members about the nature of their concerns with the proposed Form 8 K incident disclosure requirement. While the four day deadline for reporting cyber incidents would be triggered by a materiality determination by the company, our initial letter noted the many challenges that companies would face in making these subjective assessments in rapidly evolving situations. Given these difficulties and companies concerns about later legal and regulatory actions challenging the timing of their disclosures, we expect that many companies will opt to make placeholder or boilerplate disclosures before knowing the full details about a cybersecurity incident or whether it is actually material.3 As a result, investors likely will be overloaded with excessive, unhelpful, and potentially confusing disclosures and may overlook those disclosures about material incidents, as some have noted.4 Such premature disclosures may lead investors (especially retail shareholders who have less access to corporate officials) to make ill advised decisions to sell their shares based on incomplete information. In these ways, the proposed Form 8 K requirement has the potential to undermine the Commissions mission to protect investors.  3 In its comment letter, the American Investment Council, which represents private equity firms, likewise warned that issuers may feel compelled by the proposed incident reporting requirement to make many placeholder filings that are not useful for investors. See American Investment Council, Letter re: Four Business Day Cybersecurity Incident Reporting Requirement under the Proposed Amendment adding Item 1.05 to Form 8 K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (May 9, 2022) (The Proposed Item incentivizes issuers to file ‘placeholder disclosures that contain information that is vague or likely to change, in order to avoid any doubt that they have met the four business day notification requirement. The resulting flood of ambiguous and equivocal disclosures (which will include notifications for cybersecurity incidents that ultimately turn out not to be material) will undermine the SECs investor protection mission because investors will not be able to identify the information that actually matters to their investments. Indeed, given the likely volume of 8 Ks that will be of limited value, investors may become numb to these disclosures  which would undercut the SECs stated purpose of equipping investors and market participants with information to ‘assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity incident on an issuer.).  4 Asset manager Federated Hermes raised similar concerns about investor confusion in its comment letter. See Comment Letter of Federated Hermes, Inc. on the Securities and Exchange Commissions Proposed Cybersecurity Rules for Public Companies (May 9, 2022) (This subjective ‘materiality standard, coupled with a potentially impending filing deadline in order to comply with the four (4) business day disclosure requirement, will result in registrants over reporting cybersecurity incidents, which may lead to investors undervaluing cybersecurity incident disclosures . . . . Although the timeframe for filing is conditioned on the registrants ‘determination that a material event has occurred, the requirement as drafted would likely facilitate early disclosure of events which may eventually turn out to be immaterial, resulting in overdisclosure and potential investor confusion.). 5  Of the 137 respondents who answered this Society survey question, only eight indicated they did not believe that Form 8 Ks four business day deadline for reporting incidents would be impractical for the company or potentially harmful to companies and investors; five were uncertain. The overwhelming majority  90.5%  expressed concerns about practicality and/or harm to companies, investors, and/or law enforcement.5 Our survey also asked our issuer members to elaborate about their concerns over the impact of the Proposed Rules incident reporting requirement. Respondents provided the following commentary, highlighting the potential harm that premature public disclosure of an ongoing incident can cause: • Publicly disclosing an unremediated vulnerability publicly is asking to become the target of additional attacks while the company is properly focused on remediating the issue as quickly as possible. It exponentially raises the risk for the company, which, in turn, is harmful to investors. • Both impractical and potentially harmful; it draws critical focus from managements need to access and remediate. • Premature disclosure could be harmful to the company if it serves only to exacerbate the impact of the incident.  • In addition to compromising negotiations with criminals, too much may be unknown at that time, resulting in misleading or meaninglessly vague disclosure. • It would potentially put the company at odds with law enforcement and our ability to understand the problem.  • Potentially harmful to everyone except the cyber criminals. Respondents also noted the difficulty of understanding the scope and magnitude of an evolving incident; the need for adequate time for the company to assess the scope, magnitude, and impacts of the incident; the potential harms associated with premature disclosure; and the inevitability of post event second guesting by regulators and an active plaintiffs bar. As one respondent explained, the proposed incident reporting would be impractical while providing limited benefits to investors: Its impractical because facts are developing quickly and there is potential for incorrect  5 The concerns expressed by our members about the proposed incident reporting requirements are consistent with those expressed by other industry advocates. In a comment letter signed by 35 industry associations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the SEC to revise the Proposed Rule to allow for temporary delays in public disclosure. See U.S. Chamber of Commerce et. al, Comment Letter on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (June 22, 2022) (Instead of undercutting industry government cooperation, the SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement and national security agencies to mitigate the impacts of cyber incidents and help bolster companies security and financial positions, which would benefit investors.). 6  conclusions while investigations are underway. While tying it to materiality gives appropriate flexibility, the focus on promptness combined with the 4 day business clock runs the risk of market volatility due to incomplete or potentially inaccurate information based on the ongoing nature of the investigation. Further, even if a company knows an event is material, the unknown information creates unnecessary market volatility with little benefit. Are investors really being protected if what they get from the rule is incomplete or potentially inaccurate information, accompanied by market volatility? II. Potential Alternatives to the Proposed Incident Disclosure Requirement In our May 9 letter, we expressed multiple concerns about the Commissions proposed approach to incident reporting via Form 8 K  most notably, that the premature public disclosure of incidents that have not been substantially remediated, or that are the focus of law enforcement or national security activities, will cause harm to companies and their investors. To alleviate these concerns, in lieu of the proposed Form 8 K trigger, we suggested that disclosure of cyber incidents be based on the following priorities:  (1) an expedient disclosure, without unreasonable delay;  (2) allow for a delay in public disclosure when requested by law enforcement or government agencies focused on national security or the security of critical infrastructure;  (3) allow for measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the impacted system(s) or data prior to public disclosure, and;  (4) allow for reasonable notification to individuals with impacted data. As we noted in our May 9 letter, these considerations better reflect the interests and priorities that issuers should consider when evaluating the timing and content of public disclosures of cybersecurity incidents. These criteria would allow issuers to weigh the factors associated with complex situations and the risks of premature disclosure and to make disclosure decisions in accordance with reasonable judgments around those potentially competing interests and goals.  During our June 2 meeting, the Commission staff suggested that they would have difficulty learning about national security concerns, law enforcement investigations, or other reasons for delaying public disclosure of cyber incidents and would thereby be hampered in their enforcement efforts if they were to disagree with a companys disclosure judgment.  First, and most importantly, we do not think this concern is serious enough to justify exposing companies, investors, and others to meaningful harm from premature disclosure. The Commission does not ordinarily have contemporaneous information about any companys  7  decision not to disclose a particular fact. Rather, the SEC relies on its traditional investigation (such as staff comment letters) and enforcement tools to gather information and assign consequences to improper decisions not to disclose after the fact; this system has been in place for decades and has proven effective.6 Those same investigation and enforcement tools would be available to gather information from a company about its disclosure decision making process and determine whether it had improperly delayed public disclosure; there is no principled reason that these measures would not be effective in this context.7 Companies that choose to delay the public disclosure of incidents that would otherwise be material will carefully document their decision making process in anticipation of this scrutiny, and companies will not make decisions to delay disclosure lightly.  As noted earlier, we expect that most companies will probably err on the side of over disclosing marginally material incidents and/or providing limited details, but there will be some incidents where the risk of harm to the company, its customers, or law enforcement or national security interests will be so great that a delay in public disclosure will be necessary. Given that most major cybersecurity incidents impact more than one company, the risk that the Commission will never learn about material incidents is extremely small.  If the Commission continues to have concerns about obtaining information on emerging cybersecurity incidents, the Society suggests an alternative, whereby issuers would confidentially notify the Commission staff of their decision to delay disclosure of an otherwise material incident due to concerns about additional damage from an incident that has not been substantially remediated, or to protect the interests of law enforcement, national security, or the security of critical infrastructure. The Commissions question in the Proposed Rule about whether a delay in disclosure should be allowed where the Attorney General makes a written request to the Commission for national security reasons (page 30) demonstrates that the Commission has the authority to allow delayed public disclosure to avoid further harm. There are existing mechanisms by which the Commission could be confidentially informed by an issuer of a material incident that would otherwise be subject to public disclosure.8 In such a communication  6  See, e.g., Altaba, Formerly Known as Yahoo!, Charged With Failing to Disclose Massive Cybersecurity Breach; Agrees to Pay $35 Million, SEC News Release 2018 71 (April 24, 2018) (Director of Enforcement: We do not second guess good faith exercises of judgment about cyber incident disclosure. But we have also cautioned that a companys response to such an event could be so lacking that an enforcement action would be warranted.).  7 See generally In the Matter of Altaba Inc., f/d/b/a Yahoo! Inc., SEC Release No. 3927, 2018 WL 1919547 (April 24, 2018) (finding Yahoos senior management and legal staff did not properly assess the scope, business impact, or legal implications of the data breach, including how it should have been disclosed in public filings); In re First American Fin. Corp., SEC Release No. 92176 (June 14, 2021) (the SEC concluded that a company violated internal controls requirements by failing to alert senior officers to system vulnerability for several months). 8 The Commission staff routinely receives confidential treatment requests from market participants who wish to delay public disclosure. One example is the Commissions process for reviewing confidential treatment requests from investment managers who wish to delay disclosing certain positions in their quarterly 13F filings. In our view,  8  to the SEC (which could be via telephone9 or a confidential filing), issuers could provide a brief description of the incident, the companys reasons for delaying disclosure (such as a request from law enforcement), and the companys expectation regarding when it could make a public filing to disclose the incident. The Commission staff could then, if appropriate, engage in communication with the issuer about its disclosure decision, with the goal of reaching a mutual understanding about the most appropriate timing for disclosure. Confidential engagement between companies and the SEC staff would reduce the likelihood that premature public disclosure would harm a companys investors or customers and/or jeopardize critical infrastructure or the interests of law enforcement or national security.10 While the Society believes that such a confidential contemporaneous notification would be unnecessary in light of the Commissions traditional investigation and enforcement tools, we also believe that allowing companies to delay public disclosure to avoid further harm to investors, customers, critical infrastructure, or national security/law enforcement interests is a very important priority that clearly outweighs the need for investors to learn immediately about emerging or unremedied cybersecurity incidents.  Thank you for considering the Societys additional views on cybersecurity disclosure.   companies would have more compelling reasons, such as national security, a pending law enforcement investigation, or exacerbating harm to customers or shareholders, to delay public disclosure, than the purely pecuniary reasons that motivate 13F filers to request confidential treatment. Further evidence of the feasibility of confidential reporting can be found in the Commissions recently proposed rule on short sale disclosure. Proposed Rule 13f 2 would require investment managers to confidentially file a Form SHO with the SEC within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month. See Fact Sheet: Enhancing Short Sale Disclosure (Feb. 25, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/files/34 94314 fact sheet.pdf.   9 In its comment letter, Federated Hermes suggested a similar confidential reporting mechanism for cybersecurity incidents. Supra note 4. (A regime that required telephonic notification to the Commission of a potential material event, coupled with a requirement to file an 8 K at the resolution of a determined material event, would, in our view, be a better approach.).  10 In a speech on cybersecurity in April 2022, Chair Gary Gensler acknowledged the importance of national security, coordination with federal cybersecurity agencies, and other considerations beyond public disclosure. Given the SECs mission, and the evolving cybersecurity risk landscape, when considering work at the SEC, I think about it in three ways: cyber hygiene and preparedness; cyber incident reporting to the government; and in certain circumstances, disclosure to the public. See Chair Gensler, Working On ‘Team Cyber  Remarks Before the Joint Meeting of the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (April 14, 2022). Chair Genslers remarks suggest that it would be appropriate to temporarily delay public disclosure to protect national security/law enforcement interests or to prevent further harm to consumers.  9  Respectfully submitted,   Ted Allen Vice President, Policy & Advocacy Society for Corporate Governance  Darla Stuckey  President and CEO Society for Corporate Governance   cc: Chair Gary Gensler Commissioner Hester Peirce Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Commissioner Mark Uyeda Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga Renee Jones, Director, Division of Corporation Finance Erik Gerding, Deputy Director, Division of Corporation Finance",3

The comments expressed in this letter represent the views of the Committee only and have not been approved by the ABAs House of Delegates or Board of Governors and, therefore, do not represent the official position of the ABA. In addition, this letter does not represent the official position of the Business Law Section of the ABA nor does it necessarily reflect the views of all members of the Committee.    1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Exchange Act Release No. 34 94382 (Mar. 9, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 2   Recommendations Incident Reporting on Form 8 K  Timing Considerations Form 8 K disclosure should not be required until there is something meaningful to disclose. While the Committee is supportive of the Commissions focus on materiality with regard to reporting of cybersecurity incidents, we believe a Form 8 K reporting obligation that is triggered by a materiality determination alone will not result in meaningful, accurate disclosures, while presenting significant challenges for companies that have experienced a cybersecurity incident, including by putting the company at significant additional risk.  Investors only benefit when there is decision useful information that can be provided. Immediately following the initial discovery of a cyber incident, there is often a dearth of accurate information and much of what is believed to be true at the start quickly turns out to be incorrect as additional facts come to light.  Premature disclosure will cause investors more harm than good because they will be making decisions based on information that is often incomplete or inaccurate and without the full context of updated disclosures of other aspects of the companys operations. The adopting release even acknowledges that a companys disclosure about an incident may lack the precision needed for investors and the market to properly value the securities, potentially leading to information uncertainty, investor under or overreaction to certain disclosures, and thereby mispricing of registrants securities. Premature disclosure would also increase the risk of additional attacks and could worsen the incident being reported because the Form 8 K trigger (as proposed, a determination of materiality) will almost always occur before remediation which could lead the threat actor to increase, or other threat actors to initiate, efforts to exploit the existing vulnerability while the opportunity still exists. When the incident relates to a widely used third party system, requiring individual companies that use that system to make disclosure, before any disclosure is made by the third party system provider, acknowledging they are affected will increase the likelihood that a threat actor will seek to exploit the vulnerability. Absent this disclosure, potential threat actors (whether the original threat actor or a different threat actor) may not know the identity of the third partys customers. This disclosure will create additional risk of the company being attacked.  As noted, Form 8 K incident reporting should only be required when the company is able to make meaningful disclosure and should not be rushed. As an  3  alternative to requiring the Form 8 K filing within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, we believe it would be more appropriate to require Form 8 K reporting when a company determines that it has an obligation under applicable law to notify persons outside the company who are not subject to a confidentiality obligation or when a company voluntarily elects to make a public disclosure  in each case if, and only if, the company has made a determination that the cybersecurity incident at issue is material. As is the case with other Form 8 K triggers requiring a materiality determination (e.g., current Items 2.05 and 2.06), the rules should provide that the trigger occurs when the board of directors, a committee of the board of directors or an officer authorized to do so makes the materiality determination.  Further, neither proposed Item 1.05 nor the Instructions should attempt to rush a company into making the materiality determination right after an incident has occurred and before it is likely to possess sufficient information to draft meaningful disclosure. Therefore, we do not believe the language in the proposed Instructions to Item 1.05 that the materiality determination shall be made as soon as reasonably practical after discovery of the incident is necessary and could result in companies making premature and potentially inaccurate disclosures. The inclusion of such an instruction would put pressure on a company to draw conclusions about materiality in the immediate aftermath of an incident with incomplete information in order to avoid any claim that the company could or should have known that the incident was material sooner. In addition, the timeframe for disclosing third party incidents should be longer than the timeline for disclosing company incidents given the difficulties a company will face in obtaining relevant information from the third party provider.  The company will need to obtain information from the third party, and the timing of receiving this information will likely be outside the control of the company. In instances where the third party is not itself a reporting company and/or does not view the incident as material, information flow may be slow, at best. The company also may need time to verify or follow up on information provided, so the process of obtaining information needed to draft accurate and useful disclosure will in many instances fall well outside the four day trigger for disclosure.  Law Enforcement Exception Any new disclosure requirement also should include a broad law enforcement exception that applies not only in the interest of national security but also when law enforcement believes disclosure will hinder their efforts to identify or capture the threat actor. The use of a law enforcement or national security exception should be based on discussions with any appropriate governmental agency and not be limited to the Attorney Generals office. 4   Definition of Cybersecurity Incident We note that the definition of cybersecurity incident under the proposal is too broad. Under the proposal, a cybersecurity incident is an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through an issuers information system that jeopardizes the companys information systems. All types of situations could be viewed as jeopardizing information systems, thus capturing numerous risks that do not actually result in harm to the company. Further, information systems is defined as:  [I]nformation resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations. This definition is an overbroad term that could capture anything ranging from a third party service provider to a companys filing cabinet and would result in significant uncertainty for companies seeking to comply with the new disclosure requirement and, potentially, disclosure that is beyond the scope of what would be useful to investors. Accordingly, we strongly urge that the Commission provide a more tailored and narrow definition that, at a minimum, would require that the information system be within the control of the company.  More broadly, and as discussed further below, any new rules should include definitions that are consistent with existing definitions used under other federal laws and regulations, to the extent a comparable definition is available.  Required Disclosures While we acknowledge that proposed Item 1.05(a) would only require disclosure of information to the extent known to the registrant at the time of filing, the proposed requirements to disclose Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose and The effect of the incident on the registrants operations are nevertheless too detailed given the short timeframe involved and the fact that the company will first apply its resources to ending the event and then commence conducting its initial investigation of the incident. Disclosure of what the company believes it is aware of at the time of initial filing will often ultimately prove to be inaccurate or incomplete and will result in the disclosure of information that is not decision useful while at the same time unnecessarily exposing the company to disclosure liability claims. In addition, proposed item (5) (Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.) seems unnecessary given proposed item  5  (1) (When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing).  Alternatively, the phrase and whether it is ongoing could be deleted from item (1). Finally, given the constantly evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, any attempt to list examples of what may be covered will quickly become dated and cease to be helpful.  Application of Safe Harbors and Other Relief As is the case with other Form 8 K items that require a company to quickly assess the materiality of an event or to determine whether a disclosure obligation has been triggered, any required disclosure regarding a cybersecurity incident should have the benefit of the safe harbors from liability and should not impact a companys ability to use short form registration statements. We therefore support the Commissions proposed approach in this regard.  Updates to Previous Disclosure Regarding Material Cybersecurity Incidents To the extent there will be a specific requirement to disclose material changes, additions, or updates to information previously reported regarding a material cybersecurity incident, we believe the appropriate means of disclosing that information, consistent with proposed Regulation S K Item 106(d)(1), is through disclosure in Forms 10 K and 10 Q rather than Form 8 K. The concept of Form 8 K is that there are certain matters that are so material that a current disclosure is required in advance of the registrants next periodic report. But the Commission has never imposed a requirement that a registrant effectively provide live continuous disclosure about a matter through multiple updating Form 8 Ks, presumably due to Commission efforts to balance registrant burdens and investor benefits of such an approach. Imposing a requirement that registrants continuously analyze potential Form 8 K triggers for a previously disclosed incident would be unprecedented and inconsistent with the Commissions approach to similar serious events, such as material impairments and material financial restatements. Consistent with other Form 8 K triggers, registrants should be able to determine, based on (i) existing applicable law (e.g., duty to update or duty to correct, as applicable), (ii) factual developments subsequent to the filing of the Form 8 K and (iii) other considerations, such as the registrants capital markets activity, whether further disclosure about a previously reported cybersecurity incident is warranted prior to the next Form 10 K or 10 Q.  Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material in the Aggregate We do not support proposed Regulation S K Item 106(d)(2), which would require a registrant to provide disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed  6  and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate. While the Commission may conclude that the sudden and dramatic impact a material cybersecurity incident can have on a registrant warrants adding a specific disclosure item requirement for a material cybersecurity incident, the Commission should continue to rely on existing item requirements for disclosure about the impact of immaterial cybersecurity incidents which, over time, may be material. These other item requirements, which the Commission highlighted in its February 2018 interpretive guidance (Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures), include risk factors, MD&A, legal proceedings, description of business, and financial statements (including contingent liabilities). We do not see a basis for differentiating cumulative cybersecurity incidents from all other matters that could cumulatively impact a registrant, including cumulative legal matters, changes in capital resources, supply chain issues, etc. If the Commission decides to require disclosure of a series of individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents that become material in the aggregate, the Commission should revise the rule text set forth in the Proposing Release to address the following issues.  First, while the Proposing Release makes clear that the rule is intended to capture a series of related incidents2, the word related is not in the text of proposed Item 106(d)(2) and should be added.  Second, the Commission should define related in the text of the rule, similar to the way the Commission has in Rule 3 05 and Rule 3 14 of Regulation S X. We recommend that related be defined as cybersecurity incidents that are known by the registrant to have been performed by the same malicious actor or that exploited the same registrant vulnerability.  Third, proposed Item 106(d)(2) should be revised to state that the period for aggregation should run from the end of the registrants last fiscal year. Again, this is consistent with how the Commission handles aggregation of related individually immaterial events in Rule 3 05 and Rule 3 14. An indefinite time period would unnecessarily increase the burdens on registrants, complicate the Commission staffs ability to administer the rule, and not result in decision useful information.  To address the three issues described above, we propose the following revisions to proposed Item 106(d)(2):    2 Page 33 of the Proposing Release states registrants would need to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality…  7  (2) The registrant should provide the following disclosure to the extent known to management when a series of related previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has occurred since the end of the registrants last fiscal year for which audited financial statements have been filed that are material in the aggregate. Related for purposes of this paragraph means cybersecurity incidents that are known by the registrant to have been performed by the same malicious actor or that exploited the same vulnerability; Further, the disclosure required by proposed Item 106(d)(2) should be limited to the cumulative impact on the registrant and should not require detailed information about the individual incidents. To avoid burdening registrants and investors with detailed information about incidents which are by definition individually not material, the required disclosure should be limited to a brief description of the nature and scope of the related incidents and the cumulative effect of those incidents on the registrants operations. If the Commission decides to require disclosure of individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents that become material in the aggregate, such disclosure should be required in a periodic report rather than a Form 8 K. As noted above, the cumulative impacts of cybersecurity incidents over time are analogous to other matters that cumulatively impact a registrant, like legal matters, liquidity and operational challenges. These types of cumulative impacts are best addressed in periodic reports, in the context of complete information about a registrants most recent reporting period, and do not necessitate or warrant current disclosure on Form 8 K.  8  Form 10 K Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures Disclosure Proposed Item 106(a)  Definitions The Commission proposes Regulation S K Item 106(a) to adopt definitions for cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems. The Committee supports the inclusion of definitions for these terms but believes that these definitions should be consistent with existing definitions used under other federal laws and regulations, to the extent a comparable definition is available. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) includes the following definition for cybersecurity in NIST Special Publication 800 37, Appendix B: Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Aligning definitions with those in existing federal laws and regulations would help ensure that the defined terms are consistently understood, interpreted and applied in the relevant disclosure. Proposed Items 106(b) and 106(c)  Risk, Strategy and Governance  The Commission proposes Regulation S K Item 106(b) and 106(c) to require disclosure regarding a companys policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, and the boards oversight of cybersecurity risks on Form 10 K. While the Committee generally supports enhancing cybersecurity policies and procedures disclosure, such disclosure only benefits investors when it provides decision useful information. The proposed scope of Items 106(b) and 106(c) far exceeds the scope of information that would provide investors with decision useful information, and further, could undermine companies cybersecurity efforts by providing a detailed roadmap for threat actors seeking to exploit cyber vulnerabilities. (i) Proposed Item 106(b)  Proposed Regulation S K Item 106(b) would require companies to disclose detailed information about their policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Such disclosure would need to include, among other things, information about cybersecurity risk oversight of third party service providers, previous cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risks that are reasonably likely to affect the companys results of operations or financial condition. Requiring companies to disclose details about third party entities involved in assessments and audits would be cumbersome and impose a disproportionate  9  burden, particularly given that many large companies regularly rotate retained firms. Furthermore, certain software service provider information required by the proposed rule may not be obtainable by the company. To the extent disclosure about use and oversight of third parties is required, such disclosure should not require naming the specific third party used, as providing such information would likely increase the risk of cyber attacks. Similarly, requiring the disclosure of previous cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risks reasonably likely to affect the companys results of operations and financial condition would provide threat actors with information about the companys specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities and enable the exploitation of the previous or current vulnerabilities identified. Moreover, the details about a companys incident response and remediation process and techniques (including specific tools and third parties used) is highly sensitive information and could easily be used by attackers to target a company and disable key members of the team. In response to the Commissions request for comment and for the same reasons discussed herein, requiring affirmative disclosure that a company does not have any cybersecurity policies and procedures in place could invite a cyber attack from a threat actor seeking to identify companies with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The interest in providing investors with affirmative disclosure is outweighed by the interest in ensuring that such disclosures do not lead to targeted cyber attacks. In light of these considerations, we support the narrowing of proposed Item 106(b) to require only the disclosure of material policies and procedures, with materiality defined consistently with TSC Industries,3 Inc. v. Northway, Inc., Basic, Inc. v. Levinson4 and Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano.5 (ii) Proposed Item 106(c)  Proposed Regulation S K Item 106(c) would require companies to disclose detailed information related to cybersecurity governance, including the boards oversight of cybersecurity risks and a description of managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, the relevant expertise of such management, and its role in implementing the companys cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategies. The Committee believes proposed Item 106(c) requires disclosures that are far too granular and would result in over disclosure that would obfuscate material information regarding a companys cybersecurity risk governance amidst a barrage of information, such as the frequency of management reports to the board and the details of internal processes for communicating, preventing, monitoring, detecting and remediating cybersecurity incidents. We believe such detailed disclosure requirements are not warranted, and in addition to running the risk of burying decision useful information, would also result in companies    3 TSC Indus. v. Northway, 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976). 4 Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 232 (1988). 5 563 U.S. 27 (2011).  10  issuing boilerplate and immaterial disclosures. Additionally, we note that companies have varied structures and processes for managing and overseeing cybersecurity risk, but that the specifics of such structures or processes does not necessarily reflect the companyies cybersecurity maturity or sophistication. There is great potential for investors to draw the wrong conclusions about the effectiveness of a companys cybersecurity defenses based on a comparison of these disclosures across companies. Finally, we do not see a rationale for requiring such vastly different and more detailed disclosures regarding a companys cybersecurity risks in comparison to all other risks a company manages and oversees. For some companies (e.g., those where information technology or data collection represents a material portion of the business), cybersecurity is a principal risk that may require more attention and oversight than other risks. However, for other companies (e.g., those where electronic information collection or storage is incidental to the business), there may be other risks that pose significantly greater threats to the company. Given this variance and the multitude of risks faced by most companies, proposed Item 106(c) disclosures should be revised to require only a high level explanation of managements and the boards role in cybersecurity risk management and oversight in a manner that situates cybersecurity risk disclosures among and on par with other risks a company may face.  In response to the Commissions request for comment, we believe that Item 106(c)(1) should instead be adopted under Item 407, which would result in the board oversight disclosure being included in the proxy statement alongside Item 407(j) and other corporate governance disclosures. The proposed Item 106(c)(1) disclosure relates to corporate governance and board oversight topics covered in Item 407 and required in the proxy statement, which would be the logical place that investors would look to for disclosure regarding board oversight of cybersecurity and cybersecurity risk. Form 10 K and Proxy Statement Board Expertise Disclosure Proposed Item 407(j)  The Commission proposes Regulation S K Item 407(j) to require disclosure in a companys Form 10 K and proxy statement about the cybersecurity expertise of any members of the board of directors. The Committee believes that a boards role in risk oversight, including cybersecurity risk oversight, does not require members of the board to have specific expertise in cybersecurity. Companies retain and benefit from employees or advisors with the cybersecurity expertise to manage and advise on highly technical cybersecurity topics or areas of concern applicable to the company and its industry. The boards role is to oversee an ever changing range of risks confronting a company, which requires broad based skills in risk and management oversight, rather than subject matter expertise in one particular type of risk. Consequently, requiring  11  specific disclosure regarding a directors expertise in cybersecurity may have the unintended effect of boards de facto delegating cybersecurity risk oversight to the identified individual(s) and reducing the boards sense of collective responsibility for cybersecurity risk oversight. There is also great potential for investors to draw the wrong conclusion about the effectiveness of a boards oversight of cybersecurity based on the identification (or not) of a director with cybersecurity expertise. However, if the Commission nevertheless proceeds with the adoption of Item 407(j), the definition of expertise should be broadly defined to match how companies disclose other skills in the annual proxy statement. The Committee proposes the following revisions to the proposed rule: (j) Cybersecurity expertise or experience. (1) If any member of the registrants board of directors has expertise or experience relating to cybersecurity, disclose the name(s) of any such director(s), and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise or experience. In determining whether a director has expertise or experience relating to cybersecurity, the registrants board of directors should consider, among other things factors it deems relevant:  We believe that the above revision would capture a broader range of skill sets related to cybersecurity risk management and expertise. The term expertise currently appears to capture only those individuals with experience or a prior role singularly focused on information security, while the term experience would allow boards of directors to identify and disclose the relevant skills of those directors with prior experience in a broader range of related fields (e.g., those with experiences as Chief Technology Officers, Chief Information Officers or in data privacy roles). Unlike the audit committee financial expert disclosure requirement in Item 407, which includes a set of objective criteria (e.g., an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements) that can be assessed through the completion of annual director questionnaires, the term expertise here does not have sufficiently objective criteria that would allow companies to assess whether a director fulfills the qualification. Just as the scope of cybersecurity is broad, the range of skills and experiences potentially relevant to the oversight of cybersecurity is also broad.  Proposed Item 407(j) should be revised to ensure that those with relevant cybersecurity skill sets and experiences qualify as having such under the rule.  Finally, we believe the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor should be adopted to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identification. The absence of such safe harbor could result in prospective directors with cybersecurity expertise being reluctant to serve on boards of directors.  12  * * *  We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this process and respectfully request that the Commission consider our recommendations and suggestions.

Countryman  Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 Dear Ms. Countryman: I have concerns with the Commissions proposed rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File No. S7 09 22). Some of the requirements in the proposed rule could be needlessly burdensome and duplicative for public companies given the existing layers of federal cybersecurity reporting already in existence. Additionally, some of the proposed disclosures could ultimately endanger the national security of the United States by publicly exposing sensitive information, including to hackers and Americas adversaries. The Commission should provide an explicit reporting exemption for classified information and should allow companies to delay or forgo incident reports if necessary to protect the national security of the United States. In some instances, the risk of premature disclosure is broader than the potential impacts on an individual company and its investors. For many businesses that work with the federal government, including those that contract with or are subject to regulations promulgated by agencies like DOD, DHS, and the State Department, reporting information about a cybersecurity incident could implicate classified information or endanger the United States national security. Further, businesses experiencing a cybersecurity incident may have access to information critical to national security that is not specifically classified. The existence of the attack itself also may implicate national security. Reporting this information could expose sensitive information and endanger all Americans. I hope that the Commissions final rule will provide companies with the flexibility to balance the need for prompt reporting against the risks inherent in exposing sensitive cybersecurity information to the public.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, DC 20549  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  Our organizations, which represent sectors across the U.S. economy, write to provide input on the Securities and Exchange Commissions proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.  Collectively, our associations appreciate the goals of the SECs proposed rules, which focus on increasing investors knowledge of publicly traded companies cybersecurity postures. We agree with Chair Genslers view that [a] lot of issuers already provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors and that companies and investors alike would benefit if this information were required in a consistent, comparable, and decision useful manner.  However, the SECs proposed reporting regime departs significantly from the Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance, which effectively balances investor interests with companies cybersecurity disclosure obligations. The proposed rules could result in undermining cybersecurity by forcing companies to disclose incident information prior to the mitigation of vulnerabilities. Detailed public disclosures could give cybercriminals and state backed hackers a trove of data to further victimize companies, harm law enforcement investigations, and disrupt public private responses to cyberattacks. Also, the costs of the rulemaking outweigh its benefits to investors. Simply put, the proposed rules go too far and would place companies at heightened risk by compelling them to prematurely disclose increased amounts of cybersecurity incident information.  Many in the business community strongly believe that the Commissions proposal should not be finalized in its current form. Calibrating the rulemaking correctly requires the SEC to proceed with caution and coordinate with other parts of the federal government. Given the complexity of the proposal, as well as its impact on U.S. economic security and cybersecurity, the Commission should allow more time for industry input.  While this list is not exhaustive of our groups views, we urge the Commission to consider the following points as it seeks to develop a cybersecurity incident and risk management disclosure regime that both informs investors and protects companies against malicious actors.  2  • The disclosure of cybersecurity incidents should accommodate temporary delays for law enforcement and/or ongoing investigations. The Commissions proposed rules need to be revised so that companies can temporarily delay reporting on material cybersecurity incidents because of law enforcement and/or ongoing national security investigations against illicit hackers where U.S. cybersecurity is at stake. Instead of undercutting industry government cooperation, the SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement and national security agencies to mitigate the impacts of cyber incidents and help bolster companies security and financial positions, which would benefit investors.  More specifically, all 50 U.S. states have passed laws authorizing delayed disclosures to consumers of breaches of their sensitive personal data to avoid compromising an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act similarly authorizes such delayed disclosure by financial institutions, and federal law enforcement agencies make such requests of registrants in appropriate circumstances. Without a corresponding law enforcement exception, the proposed rules would undermine the judgment of the states and several federal agencies that law enforcement protects the public first.  The Commissions proposed rules should enable companies to delay disclosures due to active investigations by law enforcement and other reasonable requests (e.g., to remediate a cybersecurity incident) like other state and federal reporting laws. Companies need time to conduct internal investigations to accurately determine an incidents true scope and impact. The proposed rules could easily compel companies to make premature disclosures driven more by compliance timelines than genuine cybersecurity incident remediation factors. Companies are rightly concerned that SEC requirements mandating them to report incident and vulnerability information too early could place them at greater risk.  Further, hasty reporting may not necessarily be accurate, given the little time afforded to companies to report material cybersecurity incidents. It is possible that the severity of incidents could be overstated, thus having a potentially negative effect on a companys earnings.  • The rulemaking should not override laws and regulations related to cybersecurity and protected disclosures. The Commissions proposal overwhelmingly conflicts with the policy goals established by Congress in recent cybersecurity legislation, especially the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which was signed into law on March 15—less than a week after the SEC announced its cybersecurity proposal. The new law requires certain critical infrastructure entities to report on a confidential and protected basis covered cyber incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours. Congress intended CISA to be the primary entity for reporting cybersecurity incidents to the federal government. Lawmakers also said that a business should only have to report to federal agencies once. 3 Congress has explicitly emphasized the importance of protecting cybersecurity incident data from unwarranted disclosures. For companies that perform work for the Department of Defense (DoD), the SECs proposed rules neither recognize nor align with the evolving cybersecurity standards and disclosures required of these contractors. Several years ago, DoD initiated a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program for contractors that seeks to leverage existing standards associated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800 171 to protect controlled unclassified information in nonfederal systems and organizations. The SEC does not appear to consider the potentially contradictory, unnecessarily duplicative, or financially burdensome nature of its proposed rules when compared with the CMMC requirements.  Requirements under the CMMC process are evolving as DoD continues to adjudicate industry comments regarding its September 2020 interim rule, while working to publish another interim rule in early 2023. The CMMC process holds companies to a higher standard of cybersecurity than what is required of government agencies. The Commission appears to do the same with its proposed rules, which contributes to an imbalance of public and private sector responsibilities.*  Congress also clarified that vulnerability information should be coordinated based on principles consistent with international standards and leading industry practices requiring protection and strict confidence.  • The practicality and value of disclosing aggregate cybersecurity incidents are unclear. The proposed rules would require a company to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. The Commissions proposal is notably vague about when a number of individual cybersecurity incidents—taken together—would be considered materially reportable. Only in hindsight and with considerable business and government effort can some hacking campaigns be grouped together. The Commission does not seem to consider the costs and the difficulty of identifying and tracking material incidents in the aggregate. The feasibility and value of aggregate reporting to investors is questionable.  • The unprecedented micromanagement of companies cybersecurity programs is misguided and would not necessarily protect investors. The proposed rules embody an unnecessary micromanagement pertaining to the composition and functioning of both the management and the boards of companies. The SEC should not insert itself via disclosure rules into how a company would design its plans to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents. The proposed rules could put companies in jeopardy by forcing them to allocate resources toward compliance based reporting rather than triaging the complex elements of identifying and resolving cybersecurity incidents. If shared prematurely, the  * Additional federal laws and regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information include the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards program, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards program, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. 4  public disclosure of vulnerability data could give attackers a roadmap to exploit reporting registrants.  Similarly, disclosing the finer points of a companys cybersecurity policies and processes is excessive. This requirement would make the registrant an attractive target for malicious actors that could acquire unwarranted insights into a companys practices and develop a game plan for future exploitation. A cybersecurity program reflects a companys tailoring of the relevant laws, regulations, and standards that fit its unique structure and business environment. The proposed governance disclosures, moreover, take a detailed, one size fits all approach, which implies best practices that would not make operational sense to each company.  • Agencies, including the SEC, need to prioritize streamlining reporting regulations. The SECs proposed rules leave businesses in the unfavorable position of facing conflicting cybersecurity reporting directives from several government entities. There needs to be more assertive streamlining of cybersecurity incident reporting policies to enable businesses to understand and follow clear and consistent guidelines and requirements. CIRCIA calls on the national cyber director (NCD) to lead an intergovernmental Cyber Incident Reporting Council composed of the Office of Management and Budget, CISA, and sector risk management agencies to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize federal incident reporting requirements, including those issued through regulations. Considering CIRCIA, the SEC should collaborate with other federal agencies and cybersecurity policymakers, including the NCD, to both coordinate its proposed rules with other authorities and determine whether its requirements are advisable as written.  • Company boards should prioritize managing cyber risks but not through SEC mandates requiring cybersecurity expertise. Our associations advocate for companies to proactively prioritize cyber risk management activities, but they are concerned about the SECs call for companies to disclose the name of any board member who has cybersecurity expertise. We believe that board experts should not proliferate via government directives. Prescriptive disclosures intended to drive company behavior regarding which subject matter experts sit on companies governing bodies could lead to unwieldy and unwanted outcomes (e.g., giving investors a false sense of confidence because of the presence of a board cybersecurity expert).  Also, cybersecurity talent is scarce globally. It is unclear where companies would get the cybersecurity experts that would be driven by the Commissions proposed requirement to disclosure such expertise. There is a well established lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors that would impede companies abilities to recruit board cybersecurity experts. The SECs proposal could even create unintended barriers for historically underrepresented groups to move into cybersecurity management or board leadership roles—not due to the lack of qualifications but to the absence of formal credentials (e.g., owing to their costs) and other certifications. Even if companies could obtain the relevant cybersecurity experts for board positions, no evidence has been 5  convincingly shown that this requirement would inform investors or improve companies cybersecurity preparedness.  It is unlikely that even organizations such as NIST could readily pinpoint what constitutes expertise or experience in cybersecurity that would earn widespread agreement among industry professionals. Advancements in cybersecurity occur rapidly. Overseeing internal and external experts who are current in the field is more valuable than directors having outdated credentials. The SEC should accommodate a broader array of experiences than what the proposed rules list of cybersecurity expert criteria encompasses. Consider Item 407s definition of an audit committee financial expert. It indicates, for example, that while a chief executive officer may not simultaneously serve as the companys accountant, this person may serve as an audit committee financial expert on the board because he or she has experience overseeing the accounting function at the company. Likewise, a suitable board cybersecurity expert may come from company management and not have formal schooling or training, but this individual understands cybersecurity practices and/or has experience supervising the companys personnel who are engaged in cybersecurity activities.  • The term cybersecurity incident should be narrowed to correspond with significant incidents that do actual harm and existing definitions. The scope of the SECs definition of a cybersecurity incident is overly expansive. It should not be construed broadly, as the Commission suggests. For reasons of consistency, agencies should avoid defining terms through their own processes. A reportable cybersecurity incident should track more closely with a covered cyber incident in CIRCIA or Presidential Policy Directive, United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD 41). PPD 41 refers to a significant cyber incident as a cyber incident that is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. Material cybersecurity disclosures should correspond to significant incidents that do actual harm.  In addition, companies need clarity in reporting requirements, which should be targeted to clear, objective criteria in any rule that the SEC—with industry input—develops. The definition of a cybersecurity incident, as currently written, would lead to the overreporting of cybersecurity incidents and not serve investors decision making well.  Our organizations support responsible and protected cybersecurity reporting to the government, consumers, and investors, but we oppose the SECs proposed rules as written. The proposal runs counter to sound cybersecurity policies and practices. It should be revised to better balance transparency with cybersecurity. We are ready to work with the Commission to develop a rulemaking that provides timely information to investors while mitigating risks associated with disclosing sensitive cybersecurity information to the public.

Periodic Disclosure by Foreign Private Issuers (page 48 49) 10   SEC Proposes Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure by Public Companies  Summary  The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) is proposing rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, we are proposing amendments to require current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents. We are also proposing to require periodic disclosures about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, and the board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk. Additionally, the proposed rules would require registrants to provide updates about previously reported cybersecurity incidents in their periodic reports. Further, the proposed rules would require the cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL). The proposed amendments are intended to better inform investors about a registrants risk management, strategy, and governance and to provide timely notification of material cybersecurity incidents.  Specifically, the proposal would: ● Require current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K; ● Require periodic disclosures regarding, among other things: ○ A registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; ○ Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures; ○ Board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk; and ● Updates about previously reported material cybersecurity incidents; and ● Require the cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline eXtensible Business ● Reporting Language (Inline XBRL)  Comments should be received on or before May 9, 2022.

We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt? Answer to question whether this instruction is sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant: I believe not. ● Answer to question whether we should consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination: Yes. ● Answer to question ‘Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt delaying a materiality determination: Yes.  There should be a proposed timeframe for the incident reporting. Communication procedures for the involved team of the registrant, the rest of their organization and the external stakeholders.  There are different examples and templates for incident response teams and policies to be followed. Each organization should have a robust, tested and repeatable incident response process that is likely to reduce damage and costs in almost all cases. In article 33 of the European GDPR regulation, which defines the ‘Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, the organization needs to notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.  [Reference: https://gdpr info.eu/art 33 gdpr/] ENISA on the other hand, says that cybersecurity breach reporting is vital, not only for the public but also to help authorities recognize and respond to current trends and weaknesses.  We could for example propose a significant incident threshold in order to improve the reporting, best practices that should be shared and set at a national level, just as [EURACTIV Germany, 2022], mentions.  The current update of the NIS2 directive introduces a two stage approach. For reporting to the competent authorities or CSIRT, organizations are required within 24 hours of becoming aware of the incident, to submit an initial notification followed by a final report within a maximum time frame of one month.  Remarkably, under the proposed rules, the competent national authorities or CSIRT must also respond, within another 24 hours, to the initial report with initial feedback on the incident and, if requested, guidance on the implementation of possible mitigation measures. NIS2 also categorizes organizations/infrastructures/entities into three groups: essential entities/organizations (e.g. energy, transport, water, etc.), important entities/organizations (e.g. postal and courier services, food production, waste management, etc.), and micro and SME entities/organizations (which are excluded from the scope of NIS 2, except for providers of electronic communications networks or of publicly available electronic communications services, trust service providers). [seventytwo, 2021] 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? Answering question ‘Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by Them?, the materiality determination could be provided to the registrants by the owners of the information resources provided to them for use. This way, they get to be aware of the importance of the information (e.g., social security numbers (high risk) or just age numbers (indifferent)), without having knowledge of the nature of the information. Thus, if a cybersecurity incident takes place, the registrant is dissolved or binded to report the incident, regarding the information resources used (but not owned) by them. This way we can say that it is a safe marina, since its smaller than a harbor and hosts less information.  Answering to the last question ‘What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? in GDPR they are defined as data controllers (in very general terms, the owner of the data) and data processors (a legal or a natural person, agency, public authority, or any other body who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller).  The controller is responsible for implementing measures to ensure that processing occurs pursuant to GDPR. The processor is tasked by the text of the privacy law with helping the controller with certain tasks, including information necessary to demonstrate compliance. The processor must also immediately tell the controller if an instruction violates GDPR.  D. Disclosure of a Registrants Risk Management, Strategy and Governance Regarding Cybersecurity Risks  https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf Proposed Amendments (page 35 42) Request for Comment (page 42 44)  18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? • Page 41 of the SEC document, defines ‘cybersecurity incident as ‘an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. According to NISTs glossary, a ‘cybersecurity incident is what also is or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. So, the above SEC term of ‘cybersecurity incident is half in agreement with the NIST definition, unless it also adds the additional sentence.  My suggestion would be to use the whole of the NIST definition.  **Also, a cybersecurity incident does not necessarily always mean ‘breach as the SEC comments in page 42, where it links a cybersecurity incident to a breach. If averted, the incident does not necessarily have any data breaches. It can only be an attempt to compromise the system or the information, without managing to breach into it.  A breach is unauthorized access to data or information. If the access is obstructed by the security measures of the system, then there is no breach. Thus, a cybersecurity incident doesnt always have to lead to a breach, while a breach on the other hand, is always led by a cybersecurity incident. To sum up, I believe there should be a division between the two terms.  • In the SEC, a ‘Cybersecurity threat ‘means any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.  Again, in the NIST glossary a ‘cyber threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through a system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. Although described in different words, both definitions express the same message, so no modification needed to the term ‘cybersecurity threat in my humble opinion.  • No revision needed for the ‘information systems definition.  19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. We could define the term to mean, for example: any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would better define cybersecurity? There exist several definitions of the term cybersecurity, which in their core all say almost the same thing. For example:  The CISA, which describes cybersecurity as ‘the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.  According to the British National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), ‘Cyber securitys core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access  both online and at work  from theft or damage. Its also about preventing unauthorized access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online. Kasperskys definition of Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. Its also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories relating to network, application, operation, information security, Disaster recovery and business continuity, and end user education. IBM defines Cybersecurity as the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Techtargets Cybersecurity is the protection of internet connected systems such as hardware, software, and data from cyberthreats. Ciscos Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. The Oxford Dictionaries  Online, defines ‘cybersecurity as: The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this. The Merriam  Webster defines ‘cybersecurity as: Measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the Internet) against unauthorized access or attack. Another British organization (IT Governance) defines cyber security as ‘the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks. It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks and technologies. NIST Special Publication 800 39, 2011, defines cyber security as ‘the ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber attacks. The Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS, 2015), Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Thus, perhaps there does not need to be a definition for Cybersecurity in the conventional sense that we tend to apply to definitions for simple things like authentication of an identity because it seems that Cybersecurity is an enveloping term, and it is not possible to make a definition to cover the extent of the things Cybersecurity covers. However, there might be the need for a unifying definition, that might cover all the above definitions without any exclusions. I would therefore recommend having a part of the SEC definition unified with parts of the other different definitions as follows:  Cybersecurity involves any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any threat or any potential threat, (malicious, or unauthorized internal or external access) to devices, services, systems, and information, and is used to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non disclosure of data through digital means or theft. 34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) define the term expertise? If so, how should we define the term?  Expertise in cybersecurity would require a set of technical and workplace skills to assess vulnerabilities and respond to security incidents. Technical skills may include experience knowledge:  ● in scripting (not necessarily essential but helps understanding code) ● Controls and frameworks (NIST, ISO, etc.) ● Intrusion detection systems ● Understanding of how to secure network controls ● Different types of operating systems ● Incident response (incident response plan, malware analysis, etc.) ● Cloud computing ● DevOps (the need to add security to software development and operations) ● Regulatory guidelines (need to comply with industry and government regulations)  Workplace skills: ● Risk management ● Adaptability (lifelong learner to keep up with technology changes) ● Critical thinking ● Communication ● Collaboration  Reference: Coursera, 2022 F.

Should we amend Form 20 F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form 6 K, as proposed, to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic? Are there unique considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts?  Yes, to both. In addition to ‘yes or ‘no answers, please include option ‘not aware of. This gives an understanding of whether the registrant is involved in relevant practices or not.

But with this reliance comes risk. The increasing rate of and impact from the exploitation of software vulnerabilities has caused billions of dollars of damage and losses to thousands of companies across the world. And the malicious compromise—or even accidental failure—of software threatens firms across all industries throughout the United States. For example, the NotPetya and WannaCry ransomware attacks caused tens of billions of dollars of losses globally, and the disclosure of the software vulnerabilities Heartbleed in 2014 (Lee, 2015) and log4j in 2021 (Tan, 2022) affected hundreds of millions of devices. The compromise of the SolarWinds software in 2019 (Greig, 2022) became a potent reminder of the fragility of the U.S. dependence on modern software applications and of the poten tial harms to corporate balance sheets, customer data, and sensitive government records. Moreover, an increasing number of modern software applications are being built on a foundation of third party and open source software components, devel oped by thousands of professional and volunteer contributors across the world.

In March 2022, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis sion (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler stated, Today, cybersecurity is an emerging risk with which public issuers increasingly must contend. Investors want to know more about how issu ers are managing those growing risks (SEC, 2022). In this Perspective, we build on this cybersecurity risk and argue that, although the SEC has taken some measures to incentiv ize proper disclosure of cyber risks, software supply chain risks are an important yet overlooked concern. Recognition of the Importance of the Software Supply Chain Is Growing In 2018, the House Energy and Commerce Committee stated that [open source software] is such a foundational part of the modern connected world that it has become critical cyber infrastructure (House of Representatives, Energy and Commerce Committee, 2022). In recent years, two separate initiatives, led by open source consortiums and security software companies, have prompted the collection of data and publishing of reports that unveiled the vastness and prevalence of open source software usage through U.S. businesses and the intricate dependencies among these products (Veracode, 2020; Nagle et al., 2020). For example, Veracode, a software analysis company, has observed that software applications are reducing in size but exploding in the number of dis tributed packages, making the overall management and security much more complicated. In addition, the Core Infrastructure Initiative, an open source consortium of researchers and software manufacturers, argues that the decentralized and voluntary manner in which open source software is written and distributed means that there is often no oversight of software quality or maintenance (Nagle et al., 2020). In addition, Executive Order (EO) 14028 was released in response to the White Houses recognition of the dire state of cybersecurity across federal agencies. Section 4 of that order specifically addressed software supply chain security (EO 14028, 2021). For example, the EO directed the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the nations leading technology and cybersecurity standards agency, to create guidelines and recommenda tions for practices that improve the security and man agement of an organizations software supply chain—for example, by requiring software vendors to produce or pro vide a software bill of materials (SBOMs) as a way to reveal and document software dependencies across applications (NIST, 2022). In addition, NIST developed a taxonomy of critical software categories and functions and guidance concerning proper use and protection of these categories. PREPUBLICATION COPY 3 It also developed a set of minimums standards for vendors and developers regarding verification and testing of soft ware, including third party software. In January 2022, in the wake of disclosure of the log4j software vulnerability, the White House convened a meet ing of federal agencies, technology, and software com panies to address the state of open source software. The discussions concerned the growing acknowledgment of the role that open source software plays in modern applica tions and supporting critical infrastructure. Afterward, the White House stated, [s]oftware is ubiquitous across every sector of our economy and foundational to the prod ucts and services Americans use every day. Most major software packages include open source software (White House, 2022). In response to the meeting, a Google execu tive stated, For too long, the software community has taken comfort in the assumption that open source software is generally secure due to its transparency and the assumption that many eyes were watching to detect and resolve problems. But in fact, while some proj ects do have many eyes on them, others have few or none at all (Walker, 2022). These efforts highlight the extent and magnitude of the risks brought by software supply chain matters. Next, we examine how cybersecurity has been addressed at the SEC, both generally and in regard to one particular soft ware issue (i.e., Year 2000 [Y2K]). SECs Role in Mitigating Cyber Risk The SEC has recognized cyber risk as a growing and important concern, and it has taken several steps to address it. In 2011, the SEC issued nonlegislative guidance concern ing the disclosure of data breaches by publicly traded com panies (SEC, 2011). The guidance stated that companies need to disclose a cyber incident if the issue makes invest ment speculative or risky, or if the incident represents an event that is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the firms operations or financial condition. However, the guidance did not require disclosure of generic risks, those Two separate initiatives have prompted the collection of data and publishing of reports that unveiled the vastness and prevalence of open source software usage through U.S. businesses and the intricate dependencies among these products. PREPUBLICATION COPY 4 affecting everyone equally, or information that would jeop ardize the firms cybersecurity. In updated guidance, the SEC stated, Given the frequency, magnitude and cost of cyber security incidents, the Commission believes that it is critical that public companies take all required actions to inform investors about material cyberse curity risks and incidents in a timely fashion, includ ing those companies that are subject to material cybersecurity risks but may not yet have been the target of a cyberattack. (SEC, 2018, p. 17). Item 503(c) of Regulation S K and Item 3.D of Form 20 F require companies to disclose the most significant factors that make investments in the companys securities speculative or risky. Companies should disclose the risks associated with cybersecurity and cybersecurity incidents if these risks are among such factors, including risks that arise in connection with acquisitions (SEC, 2018, p. 13). Furthermore, Item 101 of Regulation S K and Item 4.B of Form 20 F require companies to discuss their products, services, relationships with customers and suppliers, and competitive conditions. If cybersecurity incidents or risks materially affect a companys products, services, relation ships with customers or suppliers, or competitive condi tions, the company must provide appropriate disclosure (SEC, 2018, p. 16). In early 2022, the SEC also proposed additional rules regarding cybersecurity risk management, incident disclo sure, and disclosure of the board of directors cybersecurity experience (SEC, 2022). Of most relevance to this Perspec tive, the proposed SEC guidance would require a registrant to [d]escribe its policies and procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats, including whether the registrant considers cyber security as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation (SEC, 2022). Although software risk (specifically, software supply chain risks) might be included under the general theme of a cybersecurity threat, it is not specifically mentioned that proposal or elsewhere in SEC guidance. Despite gaps in guidance around software supply chain risks, the SEC has created a portal to help investors and companies better understand cybersecurity and current threats, such as ransomware (SEC, undated). In addition, the SEC brings enforcement actions against companies for violation of its guidelines or other forms of fraud or trans gressions. As of March 2022, it has initiated more than 150 Despite gaps in guidance around software supply chain risks, the SEC has created a portal to help investors and companies better understand cybersecurity and current threats, such as ransomware. PREPUBLICATION COPY 5 enforcement actions related to digital assets or virtual cur rency, account intrusions, hacking, dark web activity, and other cyber issues. So far, these efforts over the past 20 years are largely based around disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and ensuring that conventional forms of cybersecurity precau tions are taken. However, none of the current SEC rules or regulations specifically address software supply chain risks, as described in this Perspective. The SEC and Disclosure of Y2K Risks Although the SEC may be reluctant to issue specific guid ance on the disclosure of software applications, SEC has already provided guidance on software supply chain issues within the context of Y2K. Beginning in 1997, the SEC issued guidance regarding disclosure of potential software risks caused by improper date assignment for Y2K(SEC, 1998b). The Commission described the problem as follows (SEC, 1998a): Many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field. These pro grams were designed and developed without con sidering the impact of the upcoming change in the century. If not corrected, many computer applica tions could fail or create erroneous results by or at the Year 2000. The Year 2000 issue affects virtually all companies and organizations . . . As the end of this century nears, there is worldwide concern that Year 2000 technology problems may wreak havoc on global economies. No country, govern ment, business, or person is immune from the poten tial far reaching effects of Year 2000 problems . . . Many companies must undertake major projects to address the Year 2000 issue. Each companys poten tial costs and uncertainties will depend on a number of factors, including its software and hardware and the nature of its industry. Companies also must coor dinate with other entities with which they electroni cally interact, both domestically and globally, includ ing suppliers, customers, creditors, borrowers, and financial service organizations. If a company does not successfully address its Year 2000 issues, it may face material adverse consequences. These passages clearly recognize and articulate the magnitude that software failure (either malicious or As of March 2022, the SEC has initiated more than 150 enforcement actions related to digital assets or virtual currency, account intrusions, hacking, dark web activity, and other cyber issues. PREPUBLICATION COPY 6 accidental) could have on corporate business operations. Therefore, the Commission acknowledged the gravity of the risk and justified the need for disclosure to stakehold ers about this risk (SEC, 1998b): We intend to intensify our efforts to elicit meaning ful disclosure from companies about their Year 2000 issues. Only through that disclosure can investors make informed investment decisions. We believe that companies have sufficient incentive to provide mean ingful disclosure to investors and meet their Year 2000 disclosure obligations. These incentives include business reasons, investor relations concerns, and possible referrals to our Division of Enforcement. SEC also stated (SEC, 1998b), For vendors and suppliers, the relationship is mate rial if there would be a material effect on the com panys business, results of operations, or financial condition if they do not timely become Year 2000 compliant. The same analysis should be made for significant customers whose Year 2000 readiness could cause a loss of business that might be material to the company. The company also should consider its potential liability to third parties if its systems are not Year 2000 compliant, resulting in possible legal actions for breach of contract or other harm. In our view, a companys Year 2000 assessment is not com plete until it considers these third party issues and takes reasonable steps to verify the Year 2000 readi ness of any third party that could cause a material impact on the company. Elements of Disclosure In regard to the content of the required disclosure, the SEC stated (SEC, 1998b): We expect that for the vast majority of companies Year 2000 issues are likely to be material, and there fore disclosure would be required. When a company has a Year 2000 disclosure obligation, we believe that full and fair disclosure includes: (1) the companys state of readiness; (2) the costs to address the companys Year 2000 issues; (3) the risks of the companys Year 2000 issues; and (4) the companys contingency plans. Scope of Disclosure In regard to scope, the SEC recommended disclosure of a minimum of three components (SEC, 1998b): • First, the discussion should address both infor mation technology (IT) and non IT systems. Non IT systems typically include embedded technology such as microcontrollers. • Second, for both their IT and non IT systems, companies should disclose where they are in the process of becoming ready for the Year 2000. The status of the companys progress, identi fied by phase, including the estimated time table for completion of each remaining phase, is vital information to investors and should be disclosed. • The third essential component is a description of a companys Year 2000 issues relating to third parties with which they have a material relation ship. Due to the interdependence of computer PREPUBLICATION COPY 7 systems today, the Year 2000 problem presents a unique policy issue. For example, if a major tele communications company discloses that it may have a business interruption, this may require many other companies to disclose that they too may have a business interruption, if material.  Proposed Disclosure Guidelines Building on previous Y2K disclosure rules, here we exam ine contemporary financial and SBOM disclosures for SEC consideration to promote increased management and transparency of software supply chain risk.  Managing Software Supply Chain Risk First, the SEC could require that companies disclose their processes for managing their software supply chain risks. In particular, such disclosures could contain the following elements: • Whether the company has a process for identify ing, assessing, and mitigating software supply chain risks would need to be identified. • A discussion of the scope of any software supply chain risk management efforts would be necessary. That is, an explanation of which business services have (and have not) been evaluated, and which busi ness services are material to the company. The com pany must also describe whether it has accounted for all IT, embedded, hardware, and other software dependent technologies. • If the company plans not to manage software supply chain risks for one or more business services or components, it must provide an explanation describing why not. • A high level description of the results from any software supply chain risk assessment, discussed separately by business service, would be necessary. That is, if software supply chain risks for some busi ness services have been completed, those assess ments should be discussed separately from business services that have not been assessed. The disclosures should be in sufficient detail to allow investors to fully understand the challenges that it faces. We sug gest that the description be similar to that provided to a companys board of directors—which typically is non technical plain English (SEC, 1998b). Although the SEC should require guidance around the disclosure of supply chain risks, the frameworks used and implemented in disclosing such guidance should be left to the individual organization. However, NIST has developed guidance concerning software supply chain management and risk disclosure (NIST, 2022). The management of soft The SEC could require that companies disclose their processes for managing their software supply chain risks. PREPUBLICATION COPY 8 ware supply chain risks may also be assisted by developing, or requesting, software bill of materials (SBOM) of inter nal, and third party software systems. As described in EO 14028, 2021, the term ‘Software Bill of Materials or ‘SBOM means a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software. Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these components in a prod uct. . . . Those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly and easily determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability. . . . Understanding the supply chain of software, obtain ing an SBOM, and using it to analyze known vulner abilities are crucial in managing risk. Reliance on Critical Software Categories and IT Products and Services As part of EO 14028, NIST was tasked with developing a list of critical software categories (EO14028, 2021). That is, soft ware that is deemed to be essential to the proper and reliable operation of an organizations computer network. These software applications may operate with elevated or adminis trative privileges to core computer networking devices (e.g., remote access and configuration management), perform or ensure critical security operations within a network (e.g., network protection, backup recovery and remote storage), or are ubiquitous applications that are often exposed to a heightened volume of software attacks (e.g., web browsers). Therefore, as a second consideration, the SEC could require companies to disclose where and under what circumstances the company uses software that • has the ability to cause material harm to the organi zation if compromised or disrupted • is included under the NIST definition of critical software (NIST, 2021). Disclosing Risks From Third Party Software Vendors Companies incur risks when using software developed by third parties, whether those software components are managed by commercial entities or open source libraries, and these risks are amplified whether dealing with major software providers or small but commonly used software libraries. For example, if a major software vendor, or cloud service provider discloses that it may have a business interruption, this may require many other companies to Companies incur risks when using software developed by third parties, whether those software components are managed by commercial entities or open source libraries. PREPUBLICATION COPY 9 disclose that they too may incur a business interruption, if material. Thus, one companys software supply chain issues might affect other companies disclosure obligations. As a third consideration, as recommended by the SEC in its Y2K guidance (SEC, 1998c), in addition to disclosure of software management practices by the company, it might also be important for companies to request the software management practices of its software supply chain—again, whether from major software vendors or small open source libraries. If a company is unable to obtain assurances about software management practices regarding a material rela tionship with a third party software vendor or application (as is more likely for open source software), a statement to that effect should be made. For example, if a company buys or uses software from a sole supplier, and that sole supplier is unwilling or unable to disclose its software supply chain management practices, a statement to that effect should be made. Disclosure of the related contingency plan (e.g., in the event that the supplier has been compromised, such as switching to another sup plier, and the ability to make such a switch) should also be discussed. Companies may also disclose the nature and level of importance of these material relationships, as well as the status of assessing these third party risks. Conclusion This Perspective has described a growing and important risk generated by the interdependency of a diverse number of software applications and components that run critical business services. Although the SEC has adopted numer ous regulations and rules governing cybersecurity, none of those specifically, or adequately, speak to this risk.  We provided several disclosure options for SECs consid eration to promote increased management and transparency of software supply chain risk. For example, the SECs Y2K disclosure requirements might serve as a useful model for developing appropriate and useful disclosure guidelines. Although it is possible that the disclosure of specific software applications might create additional risks from malicious actors, more research should be conducted into qualifying any potential risks, because it may also be pos sible that any particular knowledge may not actually be valuable to a malicious actor. Overall, we believe that increased disclosure of a com panys software supply chain risks to investors will allow investors to better assess the overall management and cybersecurity protections employed by organizations.

PREPUBLICATION COPY www.rand.org PE A2072 1 About This Perspective The nations reliance on computer software to run and manage critical business services has increased dramatically over many decades and only continues to grow. The increasing rate of and impact from the exploi tation of software vulnerabilities have caused billions of dollars of damage and losses to thousands of companies across the world. Moreover, it has become increasingly true that modern software applications are built on a foundation of third party and open source software components, devel oped by thousands of professional and volunteer contributors across the world. This complexity and decentralized nature of the modern software ecosystem mean that firms are more separated from the oversight of the software that runs their businesses and increasingly exposed to risks because of this expanding software supply chain. Although many federal government agencies are vocal in addressing this issue in their own way, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been relatively quiet. This Perspective presents a set of proposed disclosure rules that the SEC could implement to help address software supply chain security. This Perspective was conducted with support from RANDs Institute of Civil Justice and the Kenneth R. Feinberg Center for Catastrophic Risk Management and Compensation. The RAND Kenneth R. Feinberg Center for Catastrophic Risk Manage ment and Compensation seeks to identify and promote laws, programs, and institutions that reduce the adverse social and economic effects of catastrophes. Acknowledgments We would like to thank our reviewers, and RANDs Institute of Civil Justice and RANDs Kenneth R. Feinberg Center for Catastrophic Risk Management and Compensation for their generous support. Institute for Civil Justice The RAND Institute for Civil Justice (ICJ) is dedicated to improving the civil justice system by supplying policymakers and the public with rigor ous and nonpartisan research. Its studies identify trends in litigation and inform policy choices concerning liability, compensation, regulation, risk management, and insurance. The Institute builds on a long tradition of RAND Corporation research characterized by an interdisciplinary, empirical approach to public policy issues and rigorous standards of quality, objectivity, and independence. ICJ research is supported by pooled grants from a range of sources, including corporations, trade and professional associations, individuals, government agencies, and private foundations. All its reports are subject to peer review and dis seminated widely to policymakers, practitioners in law and business, other researchers, and the public. The ICJ is part of the Justice Policy Program within the RAND Social and Economic Well Being Division. The program focuses on such topics as access to justice, policing, cor rections, drug policy, and court system reform, as well as other policy concerns pertaining to public safety and criminal and civil justice.

The SANS Institute supports any means to enhance and standardize cyber disclosure while being an advocate to improve these mandates as an objective, non biased cybersecurity institution. While disclosure in cybersecurity does have potential pitfalls, the SANS Institute strongly believes that the benefits outweigh the concerns. Increased cybersecurity presence and visibility for business will only grow over time for investors, and the public, as it impacts every part of daily business operations. This need is currently being addressed by organizations that are using best practice frameworks in their cyber ecosystem such as the CIS Controls (https://www.cisecurity.org), the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) and MITRE ATT&CK Framework (https://attack.mitre.org).  The SANS Institute believes that cyber expertise is needed on the board of public corporations. The expertise should focus on cyber implications with directors who understand these issues. The SANS Institute believes this is possible through proper training and certifications that validate directors skills, similar to other industries, such as an accountant that has achieved their Certified Public Accountant designation. This will give confidence to the investors and assurance that the board can make smart decisions concerning cyber risk and investments. A great reference of work roles within cybersecurity can be found within the NICE Framework (https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied cybersecurity/nice) which lists out the tasks, skills and knowledge of potential titles of directors such as Information Systems Security Manager, Security Architect, or Cyber Defense Analyst.  Thank you once again for the opportunity to comment on these proposed rules and the SANS Institute looks forward to seeing how it will help improve the protection of investors and the public.

Jarkowski, General Counsel, NYSE Group",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128356-291125.pdf,"New York Stock Exchange 11 Wall Street  New York, NY 10005  ice.com   May 9, 2022 Via Email  Vanessa Countryman  Secretary  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street NE  Washington, DC 20549 1090 RE:  Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  File No: S7 09 22 Dear Ms. Countryman: On behalf of NYSE Group, Inc.1 (NYSE or the Exchange), we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) proposal to adopt rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting by public companies (the Proposal)2.  The NYSE is the worlds largest exchange, home to more than 2,400 listed companies having an aggregate market capitalization of more than $35 trillion. In this capacity, the Exchange recognizes the critical role that technology plays for companies across all industries and sectors. Given the importance of technology to the business and operations of virtually all listed companies, the Exchange acknowledges that information around an issuers cybersecurity risk management and incident response may be material to investors. To that end, the NYSE is generally supportive of the Proposal, but offers the following comments to help ensure that: (i) the Proposals requirements result in disclosure that is most helpful rather than overly detailed to advancing investors understanding of a companys cybersecurity risk; (ii) smaller and medium sized companies are not unfairly disadvantaged by the Proposals disclosure requirements around board member cybersecurity expertise; (iii) issuers retain the ability to delay public disclosure of an ongoing cybersecurity incident pending remediation of the incident; and (iv) issuers retain the ability to delay public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident for active law enforcement investigations, national security, or critical infrastructure protection purposes.  1 NYSE Group submits this letter on behalf of New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American LLC, NYSE Arca, Inc., NYSE Chicago, Inc. and NYSE National, Inc.  2 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File No: S7 09 22 (March 9, 2022), 87 FR 16590 (March 23, 2022). Hope M. Jarkowski General Counsel New York Stock Exchange 11 Wall Street New York, NY 10005 Page 2 of 4 The Proposals Mandated Disclosure Are Overly Detailed and May Inhibit Companies from Providing Investors with Useful Disclosure About Cybersecurity Risk  The NYSE agrees with Commissions assertion that cybersecurity is among the top priorities of many, if not most, boards of directors. Accordingly, many public companies have already developed robust cybersecurity policies and procedures that enable them to manage risks unique to their businesses and make required disclosures consistent with previous Commission guidance. The NYSE is concerned that the Proposals disclosure requirements could result in the creation of de facto minimum standards that: (i) constrain managements ability to address cybersecurity risks in a manner most suitable for their business; and (ii) give investors the mistaken impression that companies do not take their duty to mitigate cybersecurity risk seriously. Proposed Item 106  Proposed Item 106 of Regulation S K will mandate disclosures around a companys cybersecurity policies and procedures and oversight of cybersecurity risk. Among other things, proposed Item 106 would require companies to disclose: (i) whether they engage assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program;3 (ii) whether the entire board, specific board members, or a board committee is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks;4 (iii) the processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, and the frequency of its discussions on this topic;5 and (iv) whether the registrant has a designated chief information security officer, or someone in a comparable position, and if so, to whom that individual reports within the registrants organizational chart.6 The Exchange is concerned that the granular disclosures of organizational minutiae required by proposed Item 106 may result in overly detailed filings that have little utility to investors. By requiring this level of specificity in periodic filings, the Proposal focuses company disclosure on the form rather than the substance of management review. When formulating a cybersecurity risk management plan, the Exchange worries that the prescriptive requirements of proposed Item 106 may lead to corporate decision making that is driven in greater part by a desire to fit within perceived norms than by what makes sense organizationally. Accordingly, the Exchange recommends that the Commission reconsider whether all of the required disclosures mandated by proposed Item 106 are necessary or useful to investors.  Proposed amendment to Item 407  The proposed amendment to Item 407 of Regulation S K raises many of the same concerns discussed above. As amended, Item 407 would require a company to disclose whether any member of its board has expertise in cybersecurity and, if so, describe the nature of that expertise. Although these proposed amendments do not mandate that corporate boards include  a member with expertise in cybersecurity, they have the implicit suggestion that corporate boards  3 See Proposed Item 106(b)(2). 4 See Proposed Item 106(c)(1)(i). 5 See Proposed Item 106(c)(1)(ii). 6 See Proposed Item 106(c)(2)(ii). Page 3 of 4 should include a member with such qualifications. Failure to have a board member with expertise in cybersecurity, therefore, could result in investors reaching the mistaken conclusion that a company is unconcerned with cybersecurity. While the Exchange agrees with the Commission that cybersecurity is an important area of focus for nearly all public companies, it does not believe that the absence of a cybersecurity expert on a companys board is necessarily the fatal flaw that the required disclosure may implicitly suggest to investors. Corporate boards consider a wide range of important issues and should have broad discretion to determine how they educate themselves on each subject. In the area of cybersecurity, a corporate board may rely on reporting from an in house cybersecurity team or external consultants. Relying on non board member experts should not suggest that a company is unserious about cybersecurity. Further, the Proposal makes clear that there is no uniform set of credentials that constitutes cybersecurity expertise. Consequently, each public company will determine for itself whether one or more of its board members qualifies as an expert in this complicated and evolving area.  The Proposal enumerates criteria that a board may consider in concluding whether one of its members has cybersecurity expertise, but much of the criteria is vague such as having knowledge…or other background in cybersecurity. The Exchange is concerned that these ambiguous criteria may result in corporate boards reaching inconsistent conclusions about the cybersecurity expertise of their members. The potential for such divergent conclusions increases the likelihood of investor confusion and calls into question the ultimate usefulness of this disclosure at all. Accordingly, the Exchange urges the Commission to remove the proposed amendments to Item 407 from any final rule.  If the Proposal is adopted in its current form, the Exchange believes that many companies will prioritize attracting board members with cybersecurity expertise in order to demonstrate their commitment to managing cybersecurity risk. With 7,848 companies filing on domestic forms and 973 FPIs filing on foreign forms during calendar year 2020, the NYSE questions whether there are truly enough individuals with both cybersecurity expertise and other relevant experience to make them suitable candidates for service on a corporate board. If a shortage does exist, the Exchange is also concerned that smaller and medium sized companies may be disproportionately disadvantaged in attracting these highly sought after individuals for board service. For the reasons discussed above, the Exchange asks the Commission to reconsider amending Item 407 of Regulation S K. Currently, information on the business expertise of board members is disclosed pursuant to Item 401(e) of Regulation S K and the Exchange believes that such disclosures are sufficient to educate investors on the qualifications of a companys board. The Proposals Immediate Disclosure Requirements May Interfere with Ongoing Investigations to the Detriment of Investors  Proposed Item 1.05  The Proposal recommends adopting new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K to require companies to publicly disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days.  Notably, proposed Item 1.05 does not allow for any delay in reporting when there is an ongoing internal or external investigation related to the cybersecurity incident. While the Exchange understands the benefit to investors of prompt disclosure, it is concerned that the Proposals strict four day reporting requirement may compromise investigations that could lead to the recovery of stolen funds or apprehension of bad actors.  Page 4 of 4  The Exchange believes an issuer should not be compelled to publicly disclose information regarding an ongoing cybersecurity incident to the detriment of the companys active remediation efforts. Cybersecurity attacks are increasingly complex and can be carried out in several phases. Premature public disclosure of an incident without certainty that the threat has been extinguished could provide bad actors with useful information to expand an attack. Many public companies already have procedures in place to share critical information about a cyber incident with relevant federal law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Department of Homeland Security. Recent legislation such as the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act expands this framework to help establish a comprehensive reporting regime for information around a cyber incident. The Exchange believes that public companies should not be burdened with yet another set of public reporting obligations as set forth in the Proposal. In addition to revealing sensitive information while an attack may be ongoing, the Proposals reporting requirements will strain the resources of many companys cybersecurity teams, all to the detriment of the investing public.  Additionally, as the Proposal notes, many states have laws that allow companies to delay public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident if law enforcement determines that such disclosure will interfere with a civil or criminal investigation. Cybersecurity is a complex and ever evolving area, and the Exchange believes that public company investors benefit as a whole when cybersecurity intrusions are prevented. To that end, the Exchange believes that, under limited circumstances, the Proposal should provide a safe harbor permitting companies to delay public reporting of a cybersecurity incident if such delay is reasonably likely to lead to the recovery of stolen funds, apprehension of bad actors, or prevention of future cybersecurity incidents. Conclusion The NYSE recognizes the importance to public companies of managing cybersecurity risk and is largely supportive of the Commissions efforts to standardize disclosures in this area. As discussed above, the Exchange believes certain aspects of the Proposals disclosure requirements may be viewed as establishing effective governance minimums and risk burdening companies with excessive reporting requirements that do not correspond to a related benefit to investors. The Exchange also encourages the Commission to carefully consider whether some of the Proposals requirements may inadvertently inhibit rather than help thorough investigations into cybersecurity intrusions to the detriment of retail investors, law enforcement and cybersecurity incident prevention in the future.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  RE: Comment Letter on Proposed Rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, SEC File Number S7 09 22  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The Society for Corporate Governance (Society) submits this letter in response to the request for public comments by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) on the proposed rulemaking, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, as announced by the Commission on March 9, 2022, and published in the Federal Register on March 23, 2022, at 87 FR 16590, File Number S7 09 22. Founded in 1946, the Society is a professional membership association of more than 3,500 corporate and assistant secretaries, in house counsel, outside counsel, and other governance professionals who serve approximately 1,600 entities, including 1,000 public companies of almost every size and industry. Our members play an active role in advising public companies on their cybersecurity disclosures and in responding to investor questions on this topic. Executive Summary  We understand and appreciate the SECs interest in setting rules regarding disclosure of cybersecurity incidents. Following the Commissions prior guidance, corporations began establishing internal disclosure controls and procedures for determining when to disclose certain cybersecurity incidents. We welcome the use of the materiality standard for cybersecurity incident reporting, but we have concerns about other aspects of the proposed rule.  In particular, the Society believes that the definition of cybersecurity incident is overbroad in that it includes those in which there has not been any injury or measurable impact  2  to date, and that it would require disclosure based on speculation as to the materiality of any such incident. We also believe that the lack of a feasible law enforcement or national security exception for disclosures is problematic, and that the proposed disclosure timing is unworkable. We are concerned that premature disclosure before a company fully understands the scope of (and has had an opportunity to remediate) a cybersecurity incident could enable malicious actors in carrying out additional attacks. We also believe that the burden of the proposed periodic incident reporting would outweigh any potential benefit to investors. Finally, the Society is concerned about the Commissions proposal for expansive disclosures about risk management, strategy, and governance. Among other things, the proposed rule will pressure issuers to appoint a technical cybersecurity expert to their boards, regardless of whether it is appropriate for their particular governance needs. We also note that many of the proposed disclosures in this area are unique among SEC rules and carry with them unintended consequences the Commission and market participants may not have fully considered. We encourage the SEC to revise this proposed rule as follows so that investors receive more complete decision useful information from issuers about material cybersecurity incidents: 1) narrow the definition of reportable cyber incidents to include only those that cause injury or a material impact; 2) allow companies to delay disclosure so they dont interfere with law enforcement or national security investigations; 3) adjust the disclosure framework to reflect state notification statues, the complexity of assessing the materiality of cyber incidents, and the need for issuers to remediate vulnerabilities before public disclosure; 4) protect companies from the costs of frivolous securities litigation by providing a safe harbor and/or allowing furnished incident disclosures; 5) not require issuers to speculate on the cumulative impact of previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents; and 6) allow greater flexibility for companies to explain how their boards and management teams oversee and manage cybersecurity risks.   I. The Definition of Cybersecurity Incident Is Overbroad and Would Require a Speculative Materiality Assessment.  A. The Society Supports the Materiality Standard. We support the SECs proposal to use materiality as the standard for disclosures of cybersecurity incidents. The materiality standard is well known to issuers and investors and reflects the balancing of investor interests and the important needs of public companies. Restricting the reporting obligation to material incidents is necessary given that any filing related to a cybersecurity incident is likely to attract a great deal of attention and may cause an inflated reaction from the market. We do not expect these materiality assessments to be easy  and we discuss particular challenges regarding assessing the materiality of incidents that have  3  not caused injury or measurable impact to date, and timing considerations, below  but we do agree that materiality is the correct standard.  B. The Proposed Definition of Cybersecurity Incident That Jeopardizes an Information System Alone Is Too Broad and Should Include Actual Loss. The Society believes the proposed definition is problematic because the materiality analysis would require companies to consider a parade of possibilities, including by predicting the actions of malicious actors whose motivations and scope of action may not be known. The proposed definition of cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through an issuers information system that jeopardizes an issuers information system or information is overbroad, because it includes incidents where no injury or measurable impact has occurred to date. Requiring issuers to publicly disclose incidents that materially jeopardize their information systems or information  to expose to danger or risk1  requires issuers to speculate in a manner that is counterproductive to providing useful information to the investing public and incompatible with the materiality analysis and may increase the risk from such incidents. Many cybersecurity incidents start with an observable occurrence in an information system that could allow malicious actors the ability to cause loss, steal data, or disrupt business operations. However, assessing whether a cybersecurity incident will (or will not) be material is nearly impossible when the question is whether it jeopardizes an information system, i.e., expose[s an issuer] to danger or risk instead of assessing whether it actually has caused loss, harm or failure, and if so in what amount. So, while it may be reasonable (albeit difficult) for issuers to assess the materiality of those cybersecurity incidents that have had an actual impact on an issuers information systems or information, it is unreasonable to demand issuers evaluate materiality where an incident might only hypothetically impact such systems or information. C. Disclosure Required by the Overbroad Definition of Cybersecurity Incident May Be Alarming and Potentially Dangerous. There is no uniform definition of jeopardize that would be free of speculation and subject to reasonable, objective agreement, and these speculative assessments will suffer from uncertain information and look completely different when judged with the benefit of hindsight. So, faced with the SECs proposed definition, many issuers will err on the side of public disclosure because it will be so difficult to determine the materiality of speculative scenarios in a short period that issuers may be concerned about securities liability for failing to disclose them. This premature disclosure could not only provide unduly alarming information to investors, but also may significantly increase the risk arising from the incident. Given the SECs proposed  1 See Merriam Webster at https://www.merriam webster.com/dictionary/jeopardize.  4  Form 8 K disclosure requirements for cybersecurity incidents, disclosure may be required before the risk can be remediated, giving malicious actors the identity of a vulnerable company, setting it up as an easy target.  The Commission appears to be sensitive to these concerns because the proposed rule excludes from the definition of cybersecurity incident the category of cybersecurity vulnerabilities  flaws that are inherent to systems or software, rather than caused by unauthorized intrusions. The SEC did not propose that such vulnerabilities be disclosed, even if a potential exploit of them would be material,2 presumably because of the substantial risks of requiring disclosure before the vulnerability can be addressed. In other words, a vulnerability could be described as putting at risk an information system — i.e., jeopardizing it — without that risk coming to fruition, but it is not covered by the proposed rule. The Commission should take the same approach with respect to cybersecurity incidents that have not to date done any more than jeopardize such systems. D. Relying on NIST and PPD 41 Is Inappropriate as Those Regulatory Definitions Do Not Address Public Disclosure.  The Society also questions the Commissions reliance on definitions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD 41) as the basis for the SECs approach to cybersecurity disclosure, as those definitions include actual harm and do not address public disclosure. The SEC states in footnote 80 that it derived the proposed rules definition of cybersecurity incident from NIST and PPD 41. However, the proposed rules definition omits important terms that appear in each of those source definitions. In particular, NIST defines a cybersecurity incident as: An occurrence that (1) actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or (2) constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.3 (emphasis added) 2 Two examples of material vulnerabilities are the critical vulnerabilities discovered in modern computer processors, announced in 2018, named Meltdown (CVE 2017 5754) and Spectre (CVE 2017 5753 and CVE 2017 5715). CISA, Meltdown and Spectre Side Channel Vulnerability Guidance, Alert TA18 004A (Jan. 4, 2018), https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18 004A. According to CISA, Spectre affects almost all devices including desktops, laptops, cloud servers, and smartphones. 3 NIST, Computer Security Resource Center Glossary: Cybersecurity Incident (last visited Feb. 6, 2022), available at https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cybersecurity_incident (emphasis added). 5 Similarly, PPD 41 defines a cybersecurity incident as:  An event occurring on or conducted through a computer network that actually or imminently jeopardizes the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of computers, information or communications systems or networks, physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by computers or information systems, or information resident thereon. For purposes of this directive, a cyber incident may include a vulnerability in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.4  And PPD 41 further defines a significant cyber incident as:  A cyber incident that is (or group of related cyber incidents that together are) likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. (emphasis added)  By placing actually or imminently before jeopardizes, both NIST and PPD 41 clearly contemplate that a cybersecurity incident is something more than an event that merely jeopardizes an information system. Additionally, PPD 41 takes this concern one step farther by clarifying in its definition that events are only significant if they are likely to result in demonstrable harm. Careful reading of these sources, therefore, would support a more concrete definition than the SECs proposed definition, which sweeps speculative risks into the calculus when determining what requires public disclosure. Using a standard that requires an actual impact to information systems or systems would be consistent with other federal requirements. In 2022, when establishing cyber incident reporting requirements for critical infrastructure, Congress defined cyber incident as an occurrence that actually jeopardizes information or an information system.5 Similarly, in setting the regulatory notification standard for banking entities and their service providers, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently defined computer security incident by modifying the NIST definition to limit it to an occurrence that results in actual harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information that the  4 Presidential Policy Directive  United States Cyber Incident Coordination (July 26, 2016) (PPD 41) (emphasis added).  5 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022) (Section Y: Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022) (hereinafter CIRCIA), § 2240(6) and 6 U.S.C. § 659(a)(5). 6  system processes, stores, or transmits.6 In both instances, the federal legislation or regulation has further limited those incidents that must be reported to the federal government to those that are significant.7 Thus, the federal government is in agreement that the absolute floor for potentially reportable cybersecurity incidents is those that have actual impact to information or an information system. Using NIST and PPD 41 to define when issuers must publicly disclose cybersecurity incidents conflates two unrelated contexts and is unworkable in practice. It would be more appropriate for the Commission to adopt a definition whereby cybersecurity incident is defined as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through an issuers information system that actually compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an issuers information system or information residing therein. This definition — drawn directly from data breach statutes — provides a more concrete definition for cybersecurity incident, on which a materiality analysis (albeit difficult) is feasible.  Even if we could read these sources in a way that supports the Commissions proposed definition, NIST and PPD 41 are fundamentally the wrong standards on which to base a rule defining the contours of when issuers must publicly disclose material cybersecurity incidents. There is nothing in NIST that prescribes when incidents must be disclosed, because that is not its purpose. NIST is a framework that supports internal cybersecurity risk management and response. It makes sense, therefore, that NIST defines cybersecurity incident broadly. Risk management programs should consider all kinds of cyber risks and to help design controls to address them.  Similarly, PPD 41 sets forth principles governing how the federal government will coordinate response to cybersecurity threats to the federal government, national security, and the economy. Again, it makes sense to define terms broadly, because the directive seeks to apply these same principles to all kinds of cyber risks. But the PPD 41 is merely a framework for incident response and coordination. There is nothing in the directive that mandates when cybersecurity incidents must be disclosed, let alone publicly disclosed. To the contrary, PPD 41 recognizes that private sector information can be sensitive and thus this directive provides:  To the extent permitted under law, Federal Government responders will safeguard details of the incident, as well as privacy and civil liberties, and sensitive private sector information, and generally will defer to affected entities  6 See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. § 53.1 (emphasis added); see 86 F.R. 66425 n.3  7 CIRCIA at § 2240(4); 86 F.R. 66425 (limiting reporting to an incident that disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade, the viability of the banking organizations operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, or impact the stability of the financial sector). 7  in notifying other affected private sector entities and the public. In the event a significant Federal Government interest is served by issuing a public statement concerning an incident, Federal responders will coordinate their approach with the affected entities to the extent possible. (emphasis added)  E. Disclosing Unrealized Risks May Negatively Impact Contracts With Third Parties. If the rule were to require disclosure about unrealized risks, the rule could negatively impact existing information flow between issuers and their customers, vendors, and service providers. Contracts for cybersecurity sensitive goods and services typically contain customized security disclosure requirements. These provisions are usually carefully considered, with the threshold and timing of disclosure to customers and other third parties as important negotiated terms. These contractual requirements typically only require disclosure where there has been actual impact to the customers data or where such impact is reasonably likely.8 Similarly, as referenced above, laws and regulations aimed at protecting privacy and security sometimes require disclosure of incidents at third party vendors or service providers but, again, are typically triggered only where there is a reasonable likelihood that actual loss has already occurred.9 8 Various cloud computing providers have adopted breach notification contract terms that limit those notifications to incidents that involve an impact on data or information. See, e.g., Googles Data Processing and Security Terms provide that Google will notify Customer promptly and without undue delay after becoming aware of a Data Incident, with Data Incident defined as breach of Googles security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data on systems managed by or otherwise controlled by Google.

IBMs Data Security and Privacy Principles provide that IBM will notify Client without undue delay upon confirmation of a Security Incident that is known or reasonably suspected by IBM to affect Client and Security Incident is defined as unauthorized access and unauthorized use of [data, software, and information that Client or its authorized users provide, authorize access to, or input to IBM Services].

Microsofts Online Services Data Protection Agreement provides for customer notification where Microsoft becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data or Personal Data while processed by Microsoft. Microsoft, Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum, 9 (Sept. 15, 2021), https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum DPA.  Oracles Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services specifies that Oracle will notify you of a confirmed Personal Information Breach without undue delay but at the latest within 24 hours and defines Personal Information Breach as a breach of security leading to the misappropriation or accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed on Oracle systems or the Services environment that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of such Personal Information. Oracle, Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services, 4 5 (June 26, 2019), https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/data processing agreement 062619.pdf.  9 Many state data breach notification laws define a notifiable data breach in a manner that requires access or acquisition of personal information. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(g) (defining breach of the security of the  8  If the SECs rule is enacted as proposed, issuers concerned about securities liability may be incentivized to demand additional information about risks at third parties, either by revising their contracts, or by requesting additional information during unfolding cybersecurity incidents (or about past incidents). We do not believe these additional efforts to obtain information would be broadly beneficial. The need of investors to know about risks involving third parties that have not to date caused any injury or measurable impact is tenuous at best, and the downside of this requirement is the disruption caused by issuers seeking such information, information that goes beyond what they otherwise would deem necessary to run their business or serve their customers and what lawmakers and regulators seeking to protect security and privacy have deemed appropriate. If issuers obtain additional information about cybersecurity risks at third parties, another potential cost arises: the pressure to provide their own customers remedies for this unexploited and remote risk  for instance, by providing credit or other monitoring services  that no one but the SEC has deemed important enough to make subject to reporting requirements.  II. The Proposed Rule Lacks a Feasible Law Enforcement/National Security Exception. The Society believes that the proposed rule must allow an issuer to delay disclosure based on a request from law enforcement or national security agencies, and the SECs proposed exception is unworkable. The SECs failure to accommodate law enforcement and national security concerns is incongruous with existing cyber incident notification requirements at the state and federal level and would undermine national, corporate, and personal security interests. While the SEC has stated that, on balance, the importance of timely disclosures for investors does not justify reporting delays to facilitate law enforcement investigations, the Society believes that investors would be better served by allowing companies to delay disclosure when requested by law enforcement or national security officials. Premature disclosure of a cybersecurity incident amid a law enforcement/national security investigation likely will cause an adverse market reaction and greater share price volatility as investors try to make investment decisions based on incomplete information that likely will change as more facts are made public by law enforcement or security officials.   Data breach notification laws at the federal and state level that require public disclosures of cybersecurity incidents allow for a delay in such reporting to account for the needs of law  system as unauthorized acquisition of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the person or business); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 899 aa(1)(c) (defining [b]reach of the security of the system as unauthorized access to or acquisition of, or access to or acquisition without valid authorization, of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of private information maintained by a business); Tx. Bus. & Com. Code § 521.053(a) (defining breach of security system as unauthorized acquisition of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of sensitive personal information maintained by a person). 9  enforcement or national security. As a federal example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),10 under rules set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requires notification to individuals within 60 days of a security event impacting their protected health information and allows for a delay if notification would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security. This concept is also found in state data breach notification laws, which allow for the delay of notification of a breach based on a request of law enforcement.11 Furthermore, disclosing information covering cybersecurity incidents implicating classified information is prohibited under federal law and incidents involving classified information already are subject to strict, nonpublic reporting requirements to relevant government agencies. We presume the SECs proposed rule was not intended to imply that classified information should be disclosed, and we believe there should be an express exception. The SEC has invited commentors to weigh in the possibility of adding an exception based on written notification from the U.S. Attorney General that national security requires delay in disclosure. We believe that such a narrow exception would not be sufficient to address issuers concerns, for the following reasons: • The SECs question reflects that it is solely concerned with the issue of national security. While national security is plainly a sufficient consideration for delaying disclosure, it is not the only one. There are a variety of legitimate law enforcement needs that should also justify delayed disclosure, including because certain cybersecurity incidents could pose a threat to human or facility safety. • Even if the exception were appropriately limited to national security, the Attorney Generals office is not the only government entity that should be consulted in assessing the risks of disclosure. For example, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements established by the Department of Defense (DOD) requires relevant entities to report security events to the DOD directly.12  The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CSIA) was recently designated by Congress as the ingestion point for required security event reporting by critical infrastructure entities.13 CISA is then tasked with distribution of such information to relevant federal departments and agencies, including specifically those that identify and track ransom payments, including those utilizing virtual  10 45 C.F.R. § 164.412.  11 See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(c); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 899 aa(4); Tx. Bus. & Com. Code § 521.053(d). 12 48 C.F.R. § 252.204 7012(c).  13 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022) (Section Y: Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022) (hereinafter CIRCIA), § 2242.  10  currencies. CISA has publicly acknowledged that it always ensur[es] that cyber incident reporting received by [CISA] is immediately shared with [our FBI teammates].14 It is worth noting that these federal reporting requirements are non public disclosures and are exempt from government disclosure requirements like the Freedom of Information Act. To encourage voluntary reporting for purposes of national security, critical infrastructure reporting to CISA cannot be used by any federal, state, local, or tribal government to regulate or pursue enforcement against the reporting entity. By contrast, under the SECs proposal, the FBI would likely be provided with information about many cybersecurity incidents around the same time it would become publicly available via a Form 8 K, without any of the safeguards CISA provides. This could frustrate federal law enforcements efforts to investigate and apprehend the malicious actors behind cybercrime and provide less support to victimized companies and their shareholders.15 • In certain industries such as critical infrastructure and aerospace and defense, companies may be contractually or even legally precluded from making a proposed public disclosure of a cyber incident due to national security concerns unrelated to an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The SECs cybersecurity rule should thus also authorize the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. intelligence agencies, in addition to the Department of Justice, to issue national security determinations that would allow companies to delay disclosure. This change would avoid these companies being placing in the untenable position of having to choose between making a timely SEC disclosure or facing potential civil or criminal liabilities for making such a public disclosure.  • Given the four business day Form 8 K deadline after determining materiality, we believe it would be impossible to obtain such a written national security determination from the Attorney General or other high level agency officials in advance of that deadline. In light of the potential harm to national security or law enforcement investigations that could result from premature public disclosure, we encourage the SEC to delay implementation of  14 See Jen Easterly (@CISAJen), Twitter (March 4, 2022, 9:53 AM),  https://twitter.com/CISAJen/status/1499805121437487108.  15 Under the current Shields Up Advisory from CISA regarding potential cybersecurity attacks relating to the Russian attacks on Ukraine, CISA is requesting that organizations report cyberactivity and events to CISA or the FBI urgently. CISA, Shields Up Technical Guidance, https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/shields technical guidance (last visited April 27, 2022). CISA and the federal governments ability to act on such information would likely be negatively impacted if issuers also had to publicly disclose details regarding such activity or events within days. 11  this rule until it has had the opportunity to coordinate reporting requirements with other federal agencies. The Cyber Incident Reporting Council, provided for in the recently passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, will likely have suggestions for how to structure the public reporting requirements relating to cybersecurity incidents contemplated by the SEC. If the Commission is not willing to wait for this guidance, however, we encourage the SEC to permit a delay in public disclosure (or provide a regulatory safe harbor) for incidents where companies are asked to postpone disclosure by law enforcement or national security officials. Alternatively, the Commission should adopt the more flexible approach for disclosure timing described in the next section of this letter, which incorporates the interests of law enforcement and national security into an issuers disclosure obligation.  III. The Proposed Incident Disclosure Timing Is Unworkable. In addition to the concerns described above, we also have serious concerns with the Commissions proposed disclosure timing. Currently, the proposed rule requires that issuers disclose information about a cybersecurity incident via a Form 8 K filing within four business days after the issuer determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, with that determination to be made as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.  We believe that the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirement presents significant risks to both issuers and investors. We encourage the Commission to instead mandate disclosure only in required quarterly reports once the issuer has determined that a material incident is appropriate for disclosure. Using such disclosure timing would lessen the risk of unintended consequences from premature disclosures by not drawing undue attention to any particular incident, allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the severity and impact of cybersecurity incident, and enable issuers to contextualize these incidents within a broader disclosure framework.  If the SEC opts to impose a Form 8 K filing obligation for cyber incidents, we propose a more flexible approach based on state data breach notification laws that would more appropriately reflect the complexity of cyber incidents. A. Analyzing Cyber Incidents Often Takes Substantial Time. Cybersecurity incidents are complex by their very nature. The actual impact and effect of a cybersecurity incident is often not well known upon its initial discovery. Determination of the scope of a cybersecurity incident and its actual impact on the issuers operations, information systems, or information requires substantial investigation, often including the engagement of third party experts. Investigations can be particularly difficult in incidents where the evidence that the issuer may want to examine has been destroyed, obfuscated, or altered by the threat  12  actor.16 Accordingly, in many circumstances, issuers will need substantial time  weeks or even months  to validate and confirm materiality determinations. This analysis is also occurring during a time when the information system experts needed to inform the determination are often also working actively to address the incident, important work that should be prioritized. Once a Form 8 K filing is public, investors, analysts, and other market participants likely will have follow up questions about the incident, presenting an additional distraction for these experts. An understanding of an incident and its consequences often changes substantially in the first days or weeks after discovery. Issuers will struggle to determine when they know enough, particularly as there is often additional information to be analyzed that will provide detail about actual impact and severity of a cybersecurity event. Additionally, as the investigation proceeds there is often information that needs to be reconciled or deconflicted, and theories of impacts and how the systems were compromised often also change dramatically. For example, it is common for there to be an operating premise early on in an investigation that, after further investigation, is proved wrong. Sometimes, an incident initially may seem far worse than it turns out to be. Other times, incidents that initially appear to be relatively minor turn out to be more significant.17 During their investigations, issuers sometimes also reach out to benchmark with peers, formally or informally, sharing tentative views and theories.  The SEC may believe that beginning the four day Form 8 K clock after an issuer concludes an incident is material would be sufficient to address issuers concerns. However, Society members disagree, particularly given the SECs additional directive that the materiality conclusion be reached as soon as reasonably practicable. Such a requirement would put pressure on an issuer to draw a conclusion about an incident early on, to avoid any claim (made worse by hindsight bias) that the issuer could or should have known about an incidents materiality sooner. Indeed, issuers with mature cybersecurity programs that include sophisticated monitoring may be aware of more cybersecurity incidents than companies with newer cybersecurity programs with less effective monitoring. Issuers with more mature programs are also likely to have earlier analyses of and communications about cybersecurity incidents that could form the basis for disclosure. This is likely to be true, even though these issuers with mature programs may have fewer material incidents by virtue of their monitoring efforts. For this  16 According to a 2021 survey of 500 security and risk leaders at large organizations, counter incident response measures, such as log deletion, are seen in 63% of incidents. Kroll, Red Canary, and VMware Carbon Black, The State of Incident Response 2021, 4, available at https://www.vmware.com/resources/security/the state of incident response 2021.html.  17 For example, Okta was criticized for its perceived delay in telling its customers about a security event that occurred at one of its vendors. After confirming that the vendor event potentially impacted several hundred Okta customers, Okta said that it did not know the extent of the [vendor] issue at the time of the vendors initial disclosure and didnt recognize that there was a risk to Okta and our customers. Liam Tung, ZD Net, Okta: We made a mistake over Lapsus$ breach notification (March 28, 2022), https://www.zdnet.com/article/okta we made a mistake over lapsus breach notification/.  13  reason, the SECs proposed timing may single out for additional enforcement scrutiny the very issuers that are working the hardest to find and remediate incidents. These companies may respond by providing protective disclosures about well managed incidents that would not be helpful for investors, and could, potentially, provide the misimpression that investing in that company is riskier than those with less robust cybersecurity programs. As noted earlier in this letter, these early disclosures may also subject companies to attacks from other malicious actors. Ransomware attacks demonstrate another type of risk from early disclosure. Ransomware attackers frequently make sweeping claims about their access to company systems and data that can take significant time to investigate. But early disclosure of a ransomware attack before recovery of systems and data could signal to the attacker the extent to which the attack has impacted the issuer either operationally or in relation to data impacted and allow the attacker additional leverage to increase its extortion demands. Beyond the initial ransomware attacker, a disclosure could create additional demand in the illegal market for data exfiltrated from the issuer and allow for exploitation of exfiltrated data before an issuer is able to notify individuals whose data was impacted in the incident.  Another common cybersecurity incident scenario where early disclosure would be particularly harmful involves incidents initiating at third party entities. The issuer may need to obtain information from the third party to support the investigation and allow for an accurate disclosure. But the third party may not have disclosed the incident itself, either because it is not subject to any SEC disclosure requirements, or because it does not believe the incident is material to them. Obtaining such information from third parties can be difficult and prolong the time it takes to develop an accurate understanding of the incident and its potential or actual impact on the issuer. At some point, however, an issuer may conclude that it can wait no longer to disclose, even with imperfect information. This may not only result in the issuer providing information about an incident that is not actually material, thus causing unnecessary investor concern, but also may reveal confidential information about an issuers supplier relationships that may create a risk of future harm to the company in a security or general business context. In sum, a four day disclosure timeline would not allow time for deliberate examination and (as necessary) reexamination of the available evidence that would confirm a materiality determination, potentially leading to a premature and inaccurate disclosure of the actual impact of a cybersecurity incident.  For all the reasons described above, we believe the SECs proposed incident disclosure rules could: (1) unduly distract issuers from important remediation efforts; (2) discourage information sharing and other early analyses; (3) provide malicious actors with information they can use to cause harm; (4) cause a disproportionate reaction from investors, as well as customers and suppliers, about incidents that, in the end, turn out not to be significant; and 5) prompt some  14  investors to make investment decisions before an issuer has completed its full assessment of an incident.  B. Disclosure Timeframes Should be Based on State Data Breach Statutes. Rather than tying the Form 8 K disclosure obligation to an accelerated materiality determination conducted as soon as reasonably practicable, we encourage the Commission to consider a reporting timeframe that reflects the complex nature of cybersecurity incidents.  We recommend that the SEC consider adopting a more flexible approach to the timing of disclosure. Borrowing from state data breach statutes,18 this approach could require issuers to furnish a Form 8 K within four business days of confirming that a material19 cybersecurity incident should be disclosed, based on the following priorities:  (1) an expedient disclosure, without unreasonable delay;  (2) allow for a delay in public disclosure when requested by law enforcement or government agencies focused on national security or the security of critical infrastructure;  (3) allow for measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the impacted system(s) or data prior to public disclosure, and;  (4) allow for reasonable notification to individuals with impacted data.  These considerations better reflect the important interests that issuers should review when determining disclosure than the purely time focused as soon as reasonably practicable. They would allow the issuer to weigh the demands of a complex situation and the risks that advance disclosure creates and make any necessary disclosure in accordance with reasonable judgments around those competing goals. Such goals include, as already discussed, the needs of law enforcement and national security, the need to restore the integrity of information systems before disclosure, and the companys interest in not encouraging additional attacks by malicious actors. In essence, this multi factorial test allows issuers to consider the appropriate priorities in timing their disclosure. To address the SECs potential concern that such a framework may provide issuers too much discretion, we note that the determination of whether an incident is material would be within an issuers discretion under the Commissions proposed rule. Cybersecurity incident  18 See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(a); Idaho Code § 28 51 104; 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 530/10(a); Minn. Stat. § 325E.61(1)(a); N.J. Stat. § 56:8 163(a); and S.C. Code § 39 1 90(A). 19 While state data breach laws typically allow more time for issuers to assess the severity of an incident and coordinate with law enforcement, some laws require companies to provide notification of incidents that are not material.  15  reporting will inherently require issuers to exercise considerable judgement, disciplined by the possibility of inquiry and enforcement action should the Commission not agree. The approach we propose would allow issuers to exercise that discretion based on the factors most important to the disclosure decision. Finally, we encourage the SEC not to include these cyber incident disclosures on the list of Form 8 K items that could potentially cause loss of Form S 3 eligibility and to allow this new Form 8 K item be furnished rather than filed for liability purposes, given how difficult and unclear the appropriate timing of disclosure in this area inherently is.20  IV. New Periodic Reporting Requirements Would Not Be Meaningful to Investors. The SECs proposed requirements for periodic reporting about incidents (in Form 10 Qs, Form 10 Ks, and, for foreign private issuers, Form 20 Fs) also raise concerns. First, we believe the requirement for issuers to provide material updates regarding previously disclosed incidents will prove difficult for issuers and provide limited, if any, value to investors. This is particularly true with respect to the proposed requirements that issuers disclose any changes in the issuers policies or procedures as a result of a cybersecurity incident, and how the incident may have informed such changes. The reasons for changes in a cybersecurity policies and procedures are multi faceted and complex, and it would be extremely challenging for issuers to determine the relationship between those changes and any one incident. Especially given how qualified any disclosure in this area would have to be to be accurate, it is not clear how investors would benefit from such disclosure. This type of periodic disclosure also raises security concerns, as reported changes to cybersecurity policies and procedures after a cybersecurity incident could reveal potential roadmaps (details on what we have changed and why) to vulnerabilities or associated information systems.  Similarly, the requirement that an issuer disclose any potential material future impacts on the [issuer]s operations and financial condition related to a previously disclosed incident is unlikely to add value to investors that exceeds the burden it would place on issuers or that would provide any useful supplement to existing disclosure obligations. Specifically, it is unclear what  20 Given the inherent difficulty in assessing the materiality of cybersecurity incidents, we encourage the Commission to provide a reliance and liability safe harbor against Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b5 1 private claims against companies over any failure to furnish a Form 8 K on a timely basis to disclose a cyber incident. The SEC took a similar approach in its 2004 guidance on Form 8 K, providing a limited safe harbor for 8 K filings to announce the entry or termination of material definitive agreements, material impairments, restatements, and other matters. See Final Rule, Additional Form 8 K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date, Release Nos. 33 8400; 34 49424 (August 23, 2004).   16  value, if any, disclosure of potential future impacts on the issuers operations and financial condition would give investors above the existing Item 303 disclosure requirement, which require issuers to disclose any future impacts reasonably likely to have a material effect on an issuers financial condition or operating results.21 Furthermore, issuers are already required to disclose in their periodic reports matters that could make their securities speculative or risky.22 Additionally, there are potential security impacts from required disclosure of the status of incident remediation. The disclosure of any details pertaining to remediation is inappropriate, especially before an incident has been remediated. In general, these details should not be disclosed as they could expose areas of vulnerability to current and other potential threat actors. Further, remediation is not well understood by, and could be misleading for, current and potential investors. More detailed reporting about remediation could cause issuers to report developments that could point malicious actors to vulnerabilities that can be exploited or cause undue alarm among investors. We also note that disclosing updates on remediation would burden those professionals who need to focus on completing remediation (i.e., there will be inevitable follow up questions from investors, analysts, customers, news media, etc.). Second, with respect to the SECs proposal that issuers specifically disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually incidental immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate, we believe issuers will struggle to understand the principles on which the SEC expects an issuer to consider in aggregating incidents and the period of time such aggregation should cover. In what respect must the incidents be similar? The proposed rule provides no real guidance, and we do not believe meaningful guidance would be possible, given how individualized cybersecurity incidents can be. The burden of gathering information and evaluating it from multiple possible SEC perspectives does not, in our view, justify any possible benefit to investors, especially given that any material risks that arise from cybersecurity must already be reported in existing risk factor disclosures. V. The Proposed Rules Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance Disclosures Are Counterproductive and May Diminish Board Effectiveness The SECs proposed rule includes detailed requirements for disclosure about risk management, strategy, and governance that we believe will be counterproductive to an issuers cybersecurity programs, and to public company governance generally. In particular, adopting a one size fits all approach to disclosure about board and management governance of cybersecurity is unlikely to produce any more useful information for investors than they can  21 See 17 CFR § 229.303. 22 See, e.g., 17 CFR § 229.105. 17  obtain through existing corporate disclosures combined with shareholder engagement programs, proxy advisor reports, and corporate governance ratings.  A. New Expertise Disclosures May Lead to Special Interest Directors.  While public companies already provide details about the business experience and expertise of their board members, the proposed rule would mandate additional disclosure about whether they have a director with expertise in cybersecurity, with very specific guidance about what might constitute this expertise. For instance, the proposed rule gives as examples prior experience as a chief information security officer (CISO) or a security policy analyst or having a degree in cybersecurity. While the SEC also allows for knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity, including, for example, in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, the examples in this section indicate a preference for those who have been primarily employed in cybersecurity roles.  We believe this specific expertise disclosure mandate will decrease, rather than increase, the effectiveness of board oversight of cybersecurity, as well as its oversight of other issues. While it is important for boards to have a mix of directors with different skills and qualifications, those skills are generally considered broadly  companies often disclose that their directors have experience with areas like marketing or international business, for instance, rather than trying to closely tie such skills to the specific roles, work experiences, and educational background. We believe this is appropriate for the role that directors play  a board of directors should not operate as a second management team, with individual directors replicating the most important management roles.23 Rather, a board exists to provide high level oversight of strategy and operations, helping ensure management is balancing priorities, taking advantage of opportunities, and protecting against risks.  This prescriptive approach to director expertise is not necessary given the director business experience disclosures now provided by companies. Even for those directors who fill the important role of audit committee financial experts, that expertise involves only an understanding and an ability to assess the relevant issues. This understanding and ability do not require the director to have worked directly in finance and can be obtained by having been in  23 While each board member is responsible for acting with due care and loyalty and informing himself or herself about and approving major corporate action, directors are not active managers. Rather, the boards functions are generally limited to (1) authorizing major corporate actions, (2) advising corporate management, (3) assuring the efficacy of corporate reporting and auditing procedures in order to remain adequately informed of the corporations financial status, (4) regularly reviewing the corporations investments to insure compliance with all applicable provisions of law, and (5) monitoring the performance of management, setting goals, and measuring managements results against them. § 1:2. Responsibilities of directors and officers, Law of Corp. Offs. & Dirs.: Rights, Duties & Liabilities § 1:2 (2021 2022). 18  a position of actively supervising others who do so.24 In some instances, for example, experience as a CEO can qualify a director as an audit committee financial expert. Nasdaq Listing Rule IM 5605 3(2)(A) explicitly lists CEOs among those who have financial sophistication for the purposes of its related listing requirement. Similarly, valuable cybersecurity expertise can be gained through service as a CEO, COO, or other supervisory officer of a company with a robust cybersecurity program; through managing other companies that experienced cyber incidents; or through many other paths that do not necessarily satisfy the proposed rules narrow definition.  We have also noted that the SEC has taken a similar approach to disclosure of the presence of climate change expertise in its proposed disclosure rules about that topic, demonstrating that this may be part of a new trend in SEC rulemaking.25 We are concerned that the SECs new approach will put pressure on issuers to place directors on their boards who possess narrow technical skills reflecting the Commissions latest priorities, with overall negative effects on board governance. In 2018, when the U.S. Senate was considering the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, which would have legislatively required issuers to disclose whether their boards contained cybersecurity experts, our CEO, Darla Stuckey, testified to the Banking Committee about the risks of appointing special interest directors to boards.26 During her testimony, she quoted a Society member: Of course, we want our public companies boards to have the requisite skills to deal with all sorts of issues. However, specifying the types of skills that a companys board must have strikes me as the ultimate one size fits all approach and has no logical limits. Should every public company have an expert on revenue recognition? Related party transactions? Has anyone thought through the consequences of having a board comprised of one issue experts who may not have any other applicable skill sets? And would a cyber expert want to be on a board, given that he or she would likely be blamed (and possibly sued) if the company had a breach or other cyber problem?  24 Reg. S K, § 407(d)(5)(ii) & (iii).  25 Release Nos. 33 11042; 34 99478.  26 Legislative Proposals to Examine Corporate Governance: Before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs (Statement of Darla C. Stuckey, President & CEO, Society for Corporate Governance), https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Stuckey%20Testimony%206 28 18.pdf, at page 17. Following this testimony, and other testimony and debate, the legislation did not pass.  19  We reiterate the concerns Ms. Stuckey raised in her 2018 testimony. We are concerned that, especially given the well known shortage of cybersecurity professionals,27 and the potential that candidates may be concerned about personal liability for incidents if they join a board, it will be extremely difficult for issuers to find directors who meet the criteria the SEC has laid out for cybersecurity expertise who also have the broader skills and experiences needed to perform the rest of their board oversight responsibilities  including oversight of business strategy, legal and regulatory risk management, budgeting, financial reporting, executive compensation, and human capital management.  The need for specific areas of expertise/skills on the board also varies by company and industry. Many issuers already voluntarily disclose the cybersecurity experience of some of their directors, with that expertise varying in nature and depth depending on the company and the industry. Very frequently, directors are not needed to act as technical cybersecurity experts, as management has that expertise. When a board determines there is a need for additional expertise, it can ask management to provide briefings from third parties or retain them directly.28 As Ms. Stuckey also testified in 2018, directors do not typically receive the detailed operational information needed to act as second CISOs, even if that were appropriate roles for them. We are concerned that companies that add technical cybersecurity expert directors to their boards may, in some cases, give investors a false sense that the board is more actively involved in managing company cybersecurity risk than it could possibly be. Indeed, if the presence of a designated cybersecurity expert on a board causes the other directors to defer to that expert on matters related to cybersecurity, rather than engaging in a full deliberative process, the presence of the expert could even diminish the quality of cybersecurity oversight. If investors do not believe that the composition of a particular board is adequate to address cybersecurity risks at any particular issuer, they can ask the issuer for more information about the expertise of existing directors and any external advisors. The proposed rules one size fits all approach is, we believe, unnecessary and potentially harmful. 27 Organizations such as the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or ISC2, say the demand for cybersecurity workers is far outstripping the available workforce, and around 2.72 million more cybersecurity workers are needed globally. James Rundle and Kim S. Nash, Cybersecurity: Cyber Chief Try New Tactics to Get Talent, WALL ST. JOURNAL, April 21, 2022, at B5.  28 In a recent interview with PJT Camberviews email newsletter, John Galloway, global head of investment stewardship at Vanguard, expressed a similar view about cybersecurity expertise: On a topic like cybersecurity, we do not believe that every board needs a cyber expert per se. But we would expect boards to ensure they have access to the appropriate external expertise so that they can develop an understanding of the topic and provide appropriate, independent oversight. This is an area where we are actively engaging with companies and asking them to disclose how their board is addressing any gaps in skills or expertise related to cyber (as we do with other material risks). See PJT Camberview, Engaging with Vanguard, May 9, 2022.  20  If the Commission concludes that more detailed disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of the board is warranted, a less prescriptive approach would be simply to ask each issuer to explain why it believes the board, collectively, has the ability to oversee these risks adequately. This disclosure, which could appear in the proxy statement where governance matters typically reside, should satisfy the Commissions concerns without raising as many of the risks identified above. Finally, we also note that the proposed rule contemplates that disclosure about director expertise be presented in an Interactive Data File (see proposed Reg. S T, § 232.405). Proxy statements are not ordinarily presented in that manner, and we would encourage the SEC to eliminate that technical requirement. B. Board and Committee Process Disclosures Are Unnecessary and Potentially Deleterious. The degree of disclosure the proposed rule seeks about board and committee processes is unprecedented and may actually decrease the quality of governance and board oversight. We have no objection to the requirement that companies clearly disclose where governance of cybersecurity sits  on a particular committee or the full board. That is not an unusual requirement, as companies are already required to disclose, generally, how their boards manage risk.29  The proposed rule goes far beyond that, however, requiring disclosure of the processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, and the frequency of its discussions on the topic and whether and how the board or board committee considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, risk management, and financial oversight. Again, we note that the Commission is seeking similar information in its proposed rule about climate risk disclosure. We are concerned that the SEC may be embarking on a wholesale expansion of disclosure about governance, which may lead companies to regularly disclose significant portions of their board and committee calendars, agendas, and materials. This would significantly change the way boards operate with unknown, and we believe, deleterious, effect. The Society believes that requiring disclosure of the frequency of board or committee discussion of cybersecurity risks would elevate form over substance. Required disclosure of discussion frequency will inevitably put pressure on issuers to make cybersecurity a more frequent agenda topic. But frequency is only part of the story of governance  the quality of oversight depends on many other factors, such as candor and the nature of the information provided to directors. The appropriate frequency of such oversight also varies from one company  29 See Reg. S K, § 407 h.  21  to another for many reasons, some of which are obvious to investors (the nature of the business) but some of which are not (management expertise and the quality of informal discussions between directors and management between meetings). Disclosing frequency can also reveal confidential information that could provide unintended assistance to malicious actors or competitors  for instance, if a company had a confidential need to meet more regularly on cybersecurity risks in a particular year.  With respect to the processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, it is unclear what sort of disclosure SEC is looking for. Should companies disclose the number of pages of materials that directors review or the names of the in house and external experts they speak with? It is particularly hard to anticipate what the SEC is seeking with this proposed requirement, because no other SEC rule seeks such detailed board process information, a fact which should itself raise questions about its appropriateness.  The proposed usefulness to investors is even less clear. If issuers decide that their investors would benefit from hearing more detail about their board review process for cybersecurity, they are free to provide that information. Investors are also free to ask for it. The rationale for requiring this kind of disclosure at every company, however, is lacking. As a practical matter, this disclosure is going to be so general as to be useless or it is going to risk revealing confidential information about a particular company that could be improperly used by malicious actors or competitors.  This problem is exacerbated by the proposed rules detailed requirement that an issuer also discloses how the board specifically considers cybersecurity as part of company strategy, risk management, and financial oversight. What the SEC imagines this disclosure would contain is similarly unclear, particularly (again) because there are no existing disclosure requirements that take this form. Company strategy choices made by a board, and the reasoning behind them, are not ordinarily disclosed in SEC filings, and for good reason. Many issuers will find it difficult to say anything meaningful about these specific topics that avoids disclosure of confidential information that may be sensitive. Rather than turning to the boilerplate disclosure likely to be inspired by the proposed rule, investors who have concerns about a particular boards decision making would be better served by engaging with the issuer or using the mechanisms provided by state corporations law to gain more information.  C. New Management Disclosures Would Not Be Helpful to Investors. We believe that similar concerns arise from the proposed disclosures about the management of cybersecurity risks, another sort of disclosure requirement without real precedent. Existing rules around MD&A disclosure should be sufficient to elicit relevant information, and if needed could be supplemented to include discussion of the companys  22  approach to cybersecurity risk management and strategy. If issuers are compelled to disclose who on their management team is an expert in cybersecurity, where that expertise comes from, where they fit in the organization, and how often they meet with other management experts and the board, the temptation will be to create a program that an issuer believes will look good to investors  and one that looks like other issuers programs  regardless of that companys particular needs. These detailed requirements may also disincentivize issuers from changing their personnel or programs, even where change would improve the management of cybersecurity risk. It also appears disproportionate to any conceivable investor interest  why should an investor need to know more about a companys CISO than it does about its CEO? In addition, disclosing a companys policies and procedures provides a potential road map to potential vulnerabilities in the oversight of its information systems. This proposed mandate is without precedent in existing securities disclosure requirements, and we are concerned that the SEC has not fully considered the implications of this more intrusive and prescriptive approach.  Thank you for considering the Societys views on cybersecurity disclosure.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  May 9, 2022  RE: Comment Letter on Proposed Rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, SEC RIN: 3235 AM89, File Number S7 09 22  Dear Secretary Countryman:  The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) hereby submits this letter in response to the request for public comments by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the proposed rulemaking, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, as announced by the Commission on March 9, 2022, and published in the Federal Register on March 23, 2022, at 87 FR 16590, File Number S7 09 22. Our response to specific SEC questions are below.  1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?  Reports on material cybersecurity incidents will help investors more accurately define the inherent operational risks of a company to make more informed investment and voting choices. The proposed disclosure content is practicable for most/all large enterprises, when basic cybersecurity policies and procedures are in place. The timing requirement is perhaps both onerous to the firm and possibly counterproductive to the investor consuming the information, however, as it often requires a security team multiple weeks to fully assess the severity, impact and scope of an incident, especially in larger enterprises. A competent security function operating in a defined policy and procedural framework should have an initial situational awareness of an incidents severity and impact within 3 5 working days, but additional time may be needed to prepare the documentation, perform adequate internal quality and compliance reviews, and solicit subject matter expert opinions and reviews.  As part of the initial pre public reporting, law enforcement should be recognized as a consultant. It is not unusual for law enforcement to want incidents to remain out of the media to protect their investigations, and that should be honored.  Entity should at some point also provide comment on long term remediation strategy, so long as no information that can be exploited is revealed. There exists a need to differentiate remediation actions taken during triage versus expected future process, systems, etc. changes to mitigate against similar, potential future incidents. 2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident that Item 1.05 should require?  The requirement A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident is less helpful than having a defined severity and impact scoring rubric, along the lines of CVSS v3.0/.1 Ratings [ref: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln metrics/cvss/v3 calculator], which would allow for aggregate analysis and trend analysis both for a specific company and for comparative analysis across firms and industries. CISA has proposed such a framework here: https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/CISA National Cyber Incident Scoring System with a demo prototype here: https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/nciss/demo A ratings system that would help stakeholders assess the long term impact to the business makes more sense.  It would be good to see some verbiage around the metrics associated with the incident. How long to identify, how long to contain, how long to mitigate, any associated plan of action to remove/remediate the risk to the company & its investors, so long as it was not sensitive information that might aid attackers. This would allow investors to review the disclosures over time and identify which companies are actually going in the right direction.  3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example, should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the registrants next periodic report? If so, which disclosures?  We need to minimize the disclosure of anything that would compromise an investigation or would provide intel useful to a hacker. First, there should be an initial, non public reporting, more like a heads up, to the appropriate governing body, including Law Enforcement. As part of that process, a collaborative decision would be made about what and when should be disclosed.  This could be followed by an interim public report at a later date, and, where appropriate, a final report. Quite often an accurate impact of these incidents is not known for quite some time. Interested parties should be kept abreast as the situation evolves both up and down.  Providing awareness (entity should also disclose additional resources/law enforcement/etc. which are supporting containment/forensics) should encourage investors to maintain awareness to the situation at play, but this also limits the disclosure of information which may: (1) evolve over time, hence reducing retractions or clarifications to comments and disclosures and; (2) introduce additional interest in exploitation of the root of the incident. Also, appropriate communication is part of the cyber world. Every time a security vulnerability is discovered and/or a patch is released, IT departments all over the world start patching an assessing their infra, thats part of the daily routine from IT. Thus, communication is a key component for everyones safety. 4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?  A longer period seems both more realistic and allows for more refined and useful information collection and analysis, without significant negative repercussions for the company, investors, or regulatory reviewers.  An initial, non public heads up to appropriate government entities, including law enforcement, with something more formal and public to follow makes more sense. Since one of the goals is to improve overall cyber hygiene/ reduce risk, there needs to be Law Enforcement (and potentially other) engagement prior to public disclosure. Deadlines should be tolled at the request of law enforcement IF if both parties agree that it could impede the investigation. 5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold?  The SECs proposed reporting trigger is predicated on the notion that all listed entities must then equally define their view of an incident. Additionally, given the proposed timeline, smaller organizations may risk reporting false positives, in the event they have lesser resources to promptly make a determination on the incidents details. The investment community may have knee jerk reactions upon reading timely incident disclosures. The rule should allow for transparency without creating a sense of panic, and that requires sufficient time for the entity to investigate, gather details with confidence, and report accordingly.  A common practice in security research is to provide for an embargo period after a researcher notifies a company or open source project of an exploitable flaw in code or a product. After that embargo period elapses, regardless of the status of a fix, the researcher is free to release information about the defect publicly. This serves the common good as it gives the project or company a reasonable opportunity to analyze and correct the defect. If the project or company does not provide a fix, the user community is entitled timely warning that an exploitable defect exists in their systems that they may take corrective measures, including discontinuing use of the affected code or component. Otherwise attackers are at an advantage and may independently exploit the defect.  A similar balance exists in the case of incident disclosure, namely that the benefit to a companys investors of notice of an incident eventually eclipses the potential benefits of non disclosure after an elapsed period of time. Further, in the case that a firm cannot effectively perform an impact analysis in a reasonable period, so as to determine materiality of the incident, that failure itself implies significant inadequacies of processes, staffing, resources, governance and/or oversight. In these cases, the benefit to the shareholders outweighs any concerns about subsequent attacks or other risks posed by disclosure of the incident.  It would be hard to assign a threshold for reporting, since assigning an accurate estimate of expected cost from the incident is extremely difficult, and there are few rigorously tested and practical or academic methodologies for such accurate estimation, especially where it pertains to loss or compromise of brand equity, consumer and employee goodwill, strategic partnership opportunities, and other intangibles that may subsequently impact a companys revenues or profits. While vendors and subject matter experts acting as consultants can provide proprietary or untested tools and analysis methods for estimating cost, there has not been sufficient academic or industry research to establish the efficacy of these tools and methods. Federal funding for such research would be highly beneficial to understanding these tools and methods for future consideration.  If the registrant cannot effectively determine the materiality of the incident, the best course of action is to base any threshold on the types and numbers of assets impacted, the attack vectors for the incident, if known, any exposure or loss of customer data, and an accounting of the amount spent to date as a direct result of the incident. CISA has published incident reporting guidance here: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Sharing_Cyber_Event_Information_Fact_Sh eet_FINAL_v4.pdf that should be reviewed and considered. Competent investor analysts can use such data to make their own assessment of materiality.  7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security?  As discussed above, yes.  8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt?  Some time pressure is appropriate, since the fact that a registrant cannot effectively perform an impact analysis in a reasonable period, so as to determine materiality of the incident, itself may imply significant inadequacies of processes, staffing, resources, governance and/or oversight.  It would be helpful to know what is considered prompt, as this may not be entirely straight forward to the investor community. This could also indicate that disclosures exceeding a certain threshold should indicate some dysfunction to the areas of business required to quantify impact (of course, which is of additional concern). 9. Should certain registrants that would be within the scope of the proposed requirements, but that are subject to other cybersecurity related regulations, or that would be included in the scope of the Commissions recently proposed cybersecurity rules for advisers and funds, if adopted, be excluded from the proposed requirements? For example, should the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirements or the other disclosure requirements described in this release, as applicable, exclude business development companies (BDCs), or the publicly traded parent of an adviser?  No. We are looking at systemic risk. The percentage of incidents from third party compromises is on the rise. 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties?  A common example of this is cloud computing. In many commercial cloud contracts, there is a definition of a shared responsibility model wherein the registrant agrees to accept certain responsibilities, while the cloud provider agrees to maintain specific controls and implement certain requirements for security. However, the choice of using cloud computing, and the particular choice of which cloud vendor or technology to use and how to secure it in relation to the shared responsibility model, ultimately rests on the registrant and is based entirely on a registrants particular cost and performance parameters and capabilities. Therefore it is difficult to conceive of a practicable framework for safe harbor that shields registrants from disclosure and materiality analysis, even where the root cause of a given incident is attributed to the cloud provider under the shared responsibility model.  While an organization can transfer responsibility, they are still ultimately accountable to their stakeholders.  11. We are proposing that registrants be required to file rather than permitted to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Should we instead permit registrants to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such that the Form 8 K would not be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act unless the registrant specifically states that the information is to be considered filed or incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or Exchange Act?  We support the proposal of furnishing the item, not subject to liability under Section 18. Incidents have the ability to evolve over time, and trends/themes of cyber threat intel can shine light on later clarifications or observations to an incident.  12. We note above a non exclusive list of examples that would merit disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K covers some, but not all, types of material cybersecurity incidents. Are there additional examples we should address? Should we include a non exclusive list of examples in Item 1.05 of Form 8 K?  Example 2 on the non exclusive list doesnt specify if the incident is related to a malicious or accidental outage, but example 1 does. Would suggest this is specified as well (do accidental technology outages, unrelated to a malicious actor, which are material in nature also require disclosure?). I presume there will be a period of time, the organization will not know if the incident is accidental or malicious. The full impact will most likely take longer to fully assess.  We support the inclusion of the list of examples in item 1.05  13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 for failure to timely file a Form 8 K, as proposed?  It depends on whether the timing is adjusted. If it is not, a safe harbor may be appropriate. 14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3?  It depends on whether the timing is adjusted. If it is not, a safe harbor may be appropriate. 16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to provide disclosure in Form 8 K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate? Yes. This situation is common especially when dealing with an Advanced Persistent Threat actor who wants to exfilitrate data and IP over time. 17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? Absolutely not. Policies are the boards statement about its security strategy and risk appetite. They are too valuable to hackers and would probably inflict the organization with all sorts of Monday morning quarterbacking that does nothing to move the balll forward (e.g., needless distractions). On a practical level, an organization of any size would have a huge number of procedures that change fairly often.  18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? On page 38, Item 2, entitled Governance, we are proposing the language changed to the follow for completeness .ability to understand how a registrant prepares for, prevents, detects, and responds to cybersecurity incidents… 20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors? 81 See supra Section II.B.2, for examples of cybersecurity incidents that may require disclosure pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. 43 This disclosure may be useful. Multiple lines of defense are a fundamental part of any robust cybersecurity strategy. These are essential aspects of existing Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) programs. Our goal should be to have Cyber folded into those programs and be a board discussion. 21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? Yes, that is something a stakeholder would want to know. A registrant should be able to to explain why they think they do not need one and why they are not subject to any requirements by all of the jurisdictions they operate in.  The SEC may want to provide for a scenario where a company needs to remain under the radar while they get their cyber hygiene in place.  22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? Yes. The concerns can be grouped into three categories. First, providing hackers too much vialbe information. Second, distracting resources during an incident to handle the SEC reporting. Third, disclosing too much about key personnel, including Board Members, makes them a target.  The SEC can handle the first item in much the same way we handle external audits and third party attestations today. We disclose the broad strokes and overall results, not specifics. The second, is to provide the mechanisms mentioned above  heads up during the event with subsequent (more) formal reporting. This would also be subject to input from Law Enforcement, et al (e.g., no public disclosure during an investigation). 23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? No, if they are required to report to the SEC they should be reporting Cyber like they would any other risk, though with the same exceptions discussed above.  The SEC might also want to consider some sort of graduated reporting based on sensitivity of data, and system risk.  27. Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)(1)? Would a requirement to name such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving on a board of directors?  There should be no requiring names of persons. Instead, require a listing of the qualifications and expertise from the BOD with names being optional so that there are less unintended effects. 28. When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors, should the registrant be required to state expressly that this is the case under proposed Item 407(j)(1)? As proposed, we would not require a registrant to make such an explicit statement.  It may be helpful for such registrants to report how they fill the gap (e.g., outside SMEs); whether they think it is not necessary or are working towards it in another way. 31. Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants? If so, how?  It could limit the pool of viable candidates. It could also turn board members into targets. Some candidates would also be concerned with extra liability. On balance, the benefits out weigh the risk. There are probably ways around this. Limiting their liability is a good first step and limiting the depth of disclosure would be another.  35. Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs, be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants?  Only if driven by the value of the data, value of assets, or system risk not because of their size.  36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the  federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should consider?  Yes, they should not have an increased liability in the same way a board member with special expertise in other fields (e.g., accounting) Thank you for taking the time to consider our comments.

Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 0609 Re: Comments on Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosure Rule  File Number S7 09 22 Dear Ms. Countryman: LTSE Services, Inc. offers its support for the proposed rule regarding additional disclosure by public companies (and related safe harbors) related to cybersecurity risks entitled Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.1 We also provide some suggested alternatives for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider in formulating the final rule related to cybersecurity disclosure. LTSE Services, Inc. is a data and analytics driven capital markets platform specifically designed for public companies and private companies planning to enter the public markets. We strive to help create a more sustainable world by ensuring that public companies that join the LTSE ecosystem have a sustainable business model and are focused on long term value creation for all of their respective stakeholders. In this regard, our affiliate, the Long Term Stock Exchange, Inc., introduced a principles based approach to addressing sustainability related issues to differentiate a companys long term strategy. Underlying this principles based approach is an understanding that companies consider material environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including those related to cybersecurity, that specifically pertain to their businesses and all their respective stakeholders. In doing so, companies are able to identify specific risks and opportunities, and in 1 See 87 F.R. 16590 (2022) turn, enhance their operating model in order to address these risks and develop a sustainable long term business strategy. This approach also enables companies to adopt a holistic view and to make fully informed, sustainable and long term decisions related to cybersecurity issues for the benefit of all stakeholders. The proposed rule would amend the current report on Form 8 K to require current disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents. The proposed requirement is to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days after the registrant determines it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The evaluation and determination of whether a cybersecurity incident is material to the registrant is complex and takes time to analyze the data and confer with third parties and experts, including a forensics firm that has reviewed the logs and other data related to the incident. Although the rule provides that [a] registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident, this language is vague and provides insufficient guidance regarding the timing related to the materiality determination that triggers the commencement of the four day reporting period. This requirement could lead to the company reporting incidents prematurely as the initial determination may result in a determination that the incident is material and when new facts surface, it can result in an alternative determination. Further, utilizing the discovery that a cybersecurity incident has occurred as a triggering event, without regard to whether it is material, would result in the reporting of events that may never rise to the level of materiality and only create confusion for investors and unnecessary work and costs for companies. While we do not dispute that there is a benefit to providing investors with information regarding cybersecurity incidents that are deemed material in a standardized and uniform format as quickly as practicable following the cyber event, the challenge comes with requiring companies to report within 4 business days of a determination that a material cybersecurity event has occurred as this is a difficult determination in many cases and requires significant diligence from the date the incident is discovered. A cybersecurity incident is a fluid situation and determining materiality can be extremely difficult at any given point in time. Unlike the typical Form 8 K event like a change in auditors, or resignation or appointment of a new director or officer, which is an event that is defined in time and largely determined by the company or a director or officer of the company, the determination of the occurrence of a material cybersecurity event is based on facts and circumstances largely out of the control of the company. Requiring this disclosure on a current basis could result in the disclosure of incidents that are not material out of an abundance of caution or additional disclosure delays as companies struggle with the materiality determination and could potentially compromise the ongoing investigation or systems of the registrant depending on the circumstance.2 As a result, we suggest that the SEC consider 2 We note that Regulation SCI, which requires disclosure by certain self regulatory organizations, of certain types of systems events, including cyber intrusion events, to the SEC and the markets, provides some valuable insights regarding the need for potential flexibility in such cybersecurity disclosures. While Regulation SCI provides for immediate notification to the SEC upon the occurrence of a cyber intrusion event concerning an SCI system it also provides for a delay in public dissemination of such information, if such notification would compromise the security of applicable SCI systems. The current proposal lacks this recognition that entities need flexibility in addressing certain types of cyber breaches. See 17 CFR § 242.1002(c)(2) (permitting a delay in dissemination of information regarding a systems intrusion if unless the SCI entity determines that dissemination of such information would likely compromise 2 making this disclosure part of the periodic reporting process, rather than a current report requirement, as material cybersecurity events are not conducive to reporting on a current basis for the reasons set out above. We agree that material updates to the cybersecurity event disclosure can also be made in the periodic reports, as needed. If the reporting of a cybersecurity incident is required quarterly, it will generally avoid the potential conflict with other obligations that arise under applicable state and federal laws, as well as conflicts with the ongoing investigation of the event. Exceptions or delays from reporting information should also be permitted where there is conflict with other applicable law or the disclosure would threaten the ongoing investigation. Given security concerns that could arise with respect to the public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, as well as policies and procedures related to the identification and management of cybersecurity threats, the SEC should consider clarifying in the final rule that such disclosure should be furnished to the SEC, rather than filed. We also agree that companies should be afforded the benefit of the safe harbors provided by Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 under Exchange Act, particularly in instances where the information is obtained from third parties and public companies are not reasonably able to verify accuracy and completeness of the information provided. Further, we agree that a company should not be penalized with the loss of S 3 eligibility if it experiences a failure to file the Item 1.05 Form 8 K timely. In addition, given the frequency of cybersecurity incidents, we believe it would be extremely difficult for public companies to have to aggregate multiple cyber incidents to trigger a materiality threshold for disclosure in a periodic report under Item 106(d)(2) of Regulation S K. That being said, multiple incidents would likely reflect a deficiency in disclosure controls that is material, and such deficiency could lead to a conclusion that disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for such period and disclosed pursuant to such rules. Finally, the proposal would amend Item 407 of Regulation S K to require disclosure of whether any member of the registrants board has expertise in cybersecurity, and if so, the nature of such expertise. Generally speaking, we believe that if the board does not have a board member who has such expertise it should be sufficient for the board to utilize a third party expert. As a result, we believe that the proposal should be revised to add disclosure regarding whether the board has a cyber expert or utilizes outside resources to advise it on cybersecurity matters if the board members lack sufficient expertise in the area of cybersecurity. We would like to commend the SEC for its thoughtful consideration of issues related to cybersecurity disclosure and the careful preparation of these proposed disclosure requirements. We appreciate the difficulty in attempting to define requirements applicable to all public companies with respect to an issue which is company specific in a significant number of respects. the security of the SCI entitys SCI systems or indirect SCI systems, or an investigation of the systems intrusion, and documents the reasons for such determination.). 3 We believe that the SECs proposed rule is a step towards ensuring that investors get a clearer and more consistent picture of these issues so that their interests are better protected. The requirement for consistent disclosure of material cyber incidents and impact on the registrants business, strategy and outlook, as well as the governance of these issues, will help to ensure that due care and full consideration has been given to these risks. We have highlighted changes we believe are necessary to address some inherent concerns we raised regarding the proposal. As a result of the foregoing, we generally support adoption of the proposed rule, with the changes noted. We believe these changes will cover gaps in current disclosure requirements and address concerns regarding the disclosure of cybersecurity issues in a standardized format.

Washington, D.C. 20549 1090  Re: Proposed Rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File No. S7 09 22  Dear Office of the Secretary:  Crowe LLP appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) proposed rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (Proposal or Proposed Rule). In relation to cybersecurity, our services include audits, for which we are required to consider the effects of information technology on financial statements and attestation engagements over controls at service organizations. It is through this lens we provide our comments.  Summary  Our views are organized around the SECs tri partite mission of maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, investor protection, and capital formation. In addition, our comments are generally grounded in the following views:   We agree with the Proposal that cybersecurity risks and incidents can impact the financial performance or position of a company, and we support the SECs efforts to provide material information to users with respect to cybersecurity.   Users and preparers might both, in certain circumstances, benefit from: o definitional clarity; o additional guidance; or o modifications to the Proposed Rule Maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets  Definitional clarity Proposed Item 106 of Regulation S K defines three terms: cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems. However, those definitions might not completely match the definitions commonly used in cybersecurity today, which are drawn from the U.S. Department of Commerces National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST provides, though its Information Technology Laboratory, a glossary1 (Glossary) of terms commonly understood in the context of cybersecurity. The Commission might consider whether it could enhance preparers ability to consistently apply the Proposals requirements and provide material disclosures to users by clarifying certain aspects of the proposed definitions or directly  1 https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/  Office of the Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 2 referencing the Glossary to assist all entities in applying any final rule in a consistent manner. The SEC might also need to consider pointing to specific definitions within the Glossary when such terms have multiple definitions (for example, the term cybersecurity itself has multiple definitions).  The Proposed Rules definitions of cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity threat might lead to inconsistent application, and the SEC might consider how the definitions could be enhanced, including by referencing specific Glossary definitions. The Proposed Rules definitions of cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity threat include reference to any information residing [emphasis added] within a registrants information systems, including both owned and used systems. The scope of any information is quite broad. In contrast, the Glossary definitions of similar terms do not refer to any information; rather, the Glossary definitions include qualifiers specifying the type of information intended to be within the scope of the definition. Broad definitions might cause preparers to incur significant costs assessing cybersecurity incidents that do not result in the need for disclosure. For example, consider a cybersecurity incident involving bank wire instructions. If a bank received fraudulent wire instructions from a mortgage title company, it is unclear whether this is a cybersecurity incident that should be analyzed for possible disclosure under the Proposal.  The Commission might consider how the proposed definitions could be enhanced to more clearly identify the types of information impacted by a cybersecurity incident (for example, personally identifiable information, non public, confidential) that should be analyzed for disclosure. Auditors also have an interest in having clear and consistent definitions, particularly in situations where the Proposal requires disclosure in a document containing audited financial statements. Under professional standards,2 auditors are required to read the other information in documents containing the audited financial statements and consider whether such information or the manner of its presentation is materially inconsistent with information appearing in the audited financial statements or contains a material misstatement of fact. To the extent disclosure of cybersecurity incidents appears in a document with audited financial statements, the ability of auditors to comply with professional standards would be enhanced through consistently understood and applied definitions. Disclosure timing considerations Timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents is key to fair, orderly, and efficient markets and to investor protection. Proposed Item 105 of Form 8 K requires disclosure within four days of the determination that a cybersecurity incident is material. Further, proposed Item 105 requires a registrant to make cybersecurity incident materiality determinations as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. The Proposal notes that materiality determinations might coincide with the date of discovery or might come after, but in any event, the Commission expect[s] registrants to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible.  Cybersecurity incidents are typically complex and come in a variety of forms that continually evolve. In our experience, it is very rare for a registrant to be able to make a well reasoned, objective materiality conclusion on the date of discovery. It can take significant time and effort to investigate, analyze, and conclude on the materiality of a cybersecurity incident after discovery, which necessarily impacts the timing of the relevant disclosure. In certain circumstances where a breach could be material, registrants, as part of a robust investigation process, might hire external parties to perform an investigation of a specific breach, which can take significant time to finalize and reach conclusions. It is unclear how a registrant should interpret as prompt a manner as feasible in this circumstance. . In certain circumstances, the ability to obtain sufficient information to evaluate materiality might be outside the control of the registrant. As noted in the Proposal, a registrant might use third party information systems through a subscription or license agreement. While such agreements often have contractual  2 PCAOB Auditing Standard 2710 Office of the Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 3 terms that require the service provider to disclose cybersecurity incidents to its customers, in our experience, it can sometimes be a lengthy process to obtain from third party providers sufficient information to make a cybersecurity materiality determination given the number of datapoints that might impact the total mix of information that are only available to the third party provider. Premature disclosure of a cybersecurity incident prior to obtaining all facts that could influence the total mix of information can have significant negative consequences for registrants, and the Commission might also consider, in the context of prompt disclosure, how best to balance the need for a full investigation of the facts. The Commission might accomplish this balance through providing a principles based framework to evaluate whether disclosure would be considered prompt under the Proposal. We do not believe prescriptive examples on prompt would be useful; however, providing examples of how any principles based framework should be applied would be helpful.  XBRL The proposed rule requires Inline XBRL tagging of cybersecurity disclosures, which we believe is appropriate and consistent with the Commissions goal to provide readily available and easily accessible information to stakeholders. Investor Protection  Cybersecurity governance The Proposal adds Item 407(j) of Regulation S K, which requires disclosure of any cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors, including the nature of the cybersecurity expertise (for example, prior work experience, specific cybersecurity knowledge or skills, or a degree or certification in cybersecurity), and the name of the board member with that expertise. The Proposal points out the 2019 2020 NACD Public Company Governance Survey3 concludes cybersecurity is a top board of director priority and cybersecurity incidents and other risks are viewed one of the largest threats to entities. The Proposal suggests these datapoints might mean investors view disclosure of whether any board members have cybersecurity expertise to be important information for investment and voting decisions. Investor feedback on the relevance of disclosures related to cybersecurity expert representation on boards is important. It is not clear how an investor might interpret an entitys lack of disclosure of a board level cybersecurity expert, but the NACD Cyber risk Oversight Handbook 20204 (Handbook) observes there simply are not enough cyber experts to populate every board. The Handbook also raises several questions it recommends boards consider before appointing a cybersecurity expert. The NACDs Governing Digital Transformation: A Practical Guide5 similarly points out that a common pitfall of recruiting digital directors is focusing solely on individuals with technical backgrounds because other skills and backgrounds might be more useful from a governance perspective. Thus, whether a board includes a cybersecurity expert might not be as relevant as the other proposed disclosures related to cybersecurity governance (for example, proposed Item 106(c) of Regulation S K). The SEC might instead consider revising the Proposal to elicit disclosure of how or whether the board engages with experts to execute its governance role over cybersecurity. Such a disclosure would complement the proposed disclosures in Item 106(c) while providing registrants with the flexibility needed to craft cybersecurity governance appropriate to their organization.   3 https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp content/uploads/2020/01/2019 2020 Public Company Survey.pdf  4 https://www.nacdonline.org/insights/publications.cfm?ItemNumber=67298  5 https://www.nacdonline.org/insights/publications.cfm?ItemNumber=65983  Office of the Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 4 Aggregation of immaterial events Proposed Item 106(d)(2) of Regulation S K requires aggregation of immaterial cybersecurity events and requires disclosure of those immaterial events when material in the aggregate. Users and preparers might benefit from additional clarification of how the aggregation should be performed and what period should be considered for aggregation. The Proposal provides an example of aggregation stating that a disclosure obligation might be triggered when one malicious actor engages in a number of smaller but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company and collectively, they are either quantitatively or qualitatively material, or both. The Proposal also acknowledges that such incidents conceptually could take a variety of forms, but it is unclear how a registrant should evaluate aggregation. For example, a registrant might interpret the Proposal as requiring aggregation when there is a single actor engaging in multiple attacks.  Another registrant might interpret the aggregation requirement as multiple actors engaging in a cluster of similar attacks (for example, multiple intrusions related to hacks of online bank accounts). Other registrants might interpret the aggregation requirement in a different way. It might be useful for the Commission to provide a principles based framework to evaluate the aggregation of cybersecurity incidents to foster consistent and comparable disclosures across registrants.  The Commission might also consider specifying the relevant timeframe for aggregation, which would also foster consistent and comparable disclosure. The Proposal requires a registrant to disclose in its next periodic report cybersecurity incidents that become material in the aggregate. However, the Proposal does not specify whether the registrant should evaluate those cybersecurity incidents that have occurred since its most recent periodic report, its most recent annual report, its initial registration, or some other period. Further, should additional immaterial cybersecurity incidents occur after the disclosure of incidents that become material in the aggregate, the Proposal does not specify if a new aggregation analysis should begin or if the new incidents should be aggregated with the previously disclosed aggregated incidents. Preparers and users might both benefit from additional clarity on how the Commission expects such analyses to be performed. Disclosure updates  Proposed Item 106(d) specifies a registrant must provide in its next periodic report any material updates to disclosures made pursuant to proposed Item 105 of Form 8 K. However, proposed Item 106(d)(2) does not appear to contain a similar update requirement for immaterial cybersecurity incidents concluded to be material in the aggregate. Preparers and users might benefit from additional clarity on whether the Commission expects updated disclosure for incidents disclosed pursuant to Item 106(d)(2).  Capital Formation  Potential costs and benefits The Proposed Rule acknowledges certain costs of additional disclosures. However, the Proposed Rule also posits that registrants might benefit through potential lower costs of capital, and investors and related stakeholders might benefit through reduction of information asymmetries, thereby reducing securities mispricing, as well as lower costs due to more uniform and comparable disclosures. The Proposed Rule also states the Commission is unable to quantify the potential benefits due to various circumstances. We agree with the Commissions perspective that a rules potential benefits and costs should be considered in making a reasoned determination that adopting a rule is in the public interest.6  We encourage the Commission to re evaluate, after an appropriate passage of time following the effective date of any final rule, the potential costs and benefits with empirical data to determine whether the objective is being achieved. 6 https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/rsfi_guidance_econ_analy_secrulemaking.pdf  Office of the Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 5 Closing  We thank the SEC for providing the opportunity to express our views on questions raised in the Request.

41,The Institute of Internal Auditors,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128358-291128.pdf,"Page 1 of 6 May 9, 2022  Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549  Dear Chairman Gensler and Commissioners Peirce, Lee, and Crenshaw: The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) thanks the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the opportunity to share comments on your pending Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposal.  For over 80 years, The IIA and its now more than 210,000 members across the globe have aided sound governance and risk management efforts in public and private sector organizations, encouraging strong internal controls and an enterprise wide approach. Auditing information systems and security is top of mind for practitioners and policymakers in this age of digital transformation and disruption, and we know from The IIAs OnRisk 2022 survey that cybersecurity remains a top risk identified by chief audit executives, boards of directors, and C suite executives.  The IIA recognizes that certain disclosures of an organizations cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and material incidents can be useful information for investors and other stakeholders and commends your efforts to examine these topics. In response to your request for comments, we offer the following feedback and suggestions.  Conceptual Model for Governance, Risk Management, and Internal Controls  The IIA believes that the SEC would benefit from explicitly recognizing and aligning its proposal with The IIAs Three Lines Model, widely recognized globally as a critical resource in successful governance. The model helps organizations identify roles and responsibilities for setting strategies and objectives, managing risks  including cyber risks  and delivering benefits and information to stakeholders. The model establishes the three essential functions of governance as:  • Accountability of a governing body to stakeholders for organizational oversight through integrity, leadership, and transparency. • Actions (including managing risk) by management to achieve the objectives of the organization through risk based decision making and application of resources.   Page 2 of 6 • Assurance and advice by an objective, independent internal audit function to promote trust among stakeholders and continuous improvement through rigorous inquiry and insightful communication. The Three Lines Model provides a foundation for describing the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, management, and independent assurance providers in setting strategies, assessing risks, designing and implementing controls, and providing assurance to stakeholders that governance, risk management, and control processes are adequately ensuring the achievement of objectives. This model is well suited to ensuring that the organizations objectives for cybersecurity are met while mitigating potential disruptions from cyberattacks. In this way, an independent assurance function is fundamental to supporting mutual trust among stakeholders.  The IIAs International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (The IIA Standards)  The IIA Standards establish a framework for governing and managing an internal audit function, which can provide valuable assurance and advisory services, including engagements covering cybersecurity risks. The Standards, together with recommended guidance, represent best practices for assessing the design and implementation of processes for governing and managing cybersecurity controls, including those that ensure compliance with SEC reporting requirements. We believe the SEC should consider requiring registrants to report whether their internal audit activity conforms with the IIA Standards.   Holistic Approach to Governance and Risk Management  The IIA, as a founding and supporting member of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO), wants to emphasize the importance of positioning cybersecurity risks as components of an organizations overall governance and enterprise risk management (ERM) processes, versus establishing siloed governance and risk management functions dedicated solely to cybersecurity in general, or regulatory reporting requirements in particular.  Responses to Specific Requests for Comment Request #20: Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors?   Page 3 of 6 IIA Response: It is likely that a significant majority  possibly the entirety  of SEC registrants employ both internal and external resources for assurance and consulting services regarding cybersecurity risks and controls. For example, second line management functions such as ERM, information security, and compliance, as well as the third line internal audit activity, often provide cybersecurity risk assessments and control advice using a mix of internal and external resources.  Therefore, we do not believe that it would be particularly useful to stakeholders for a registrant to simply state as much. Rather, we believe what would benefit stakeholders more would be an appropriately positioned, funded, and skilled internal audit function providing independent assurance that the organization employs effective, enterprise wide approaches to cybersecurity governance and risk management. Additionally, internal audit can provide uniquely relevant advice and consulting, including the evaluation of opportunities for improving cybersecurity processes, given its familiarity with the organization.  Request #17: Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements?  IIA Response: While The IIA appreciates the goal of providing decision useful information to investors, we are not convinced that this proposal would necessarily achieve that objective. The SECs comment on p. 69 given the level of the specificity that would be required, the resulting disclosures are unlikely to become boilerplate, seems to be in conflict with the statement on p. 21 we would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident. Indeed, we believe that such disclosures would tend to end up in a boilerplate format.  As an alternative to disclosing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and governance as currently proposed, we suggest that a more useful approach to ensuring cyber incidents are managed and reported effectively might be to require registrants to disclose whether they fully adopt or participate in law enforcement or national security programs, such as the Shields Up program from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  Request #1: Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?  IIA Response: For the first question, The IIA supports the SECs role in protecting investors interests and the objective of requiring disclosures of material events in a timely fashion. For financial reporting, the concept of materiality is time tested, even though it is defined as including  Page 4 of 6 objective and subjective measures. For non financial reporting, especially for relatively new types of events such as cyber incidents and data privacy breaches, established norms for determining materiality have not yet been widely adopted, as illustrated by the current proposals lack of guidance for determining the materiality of cyber incidents. For this reason, The IIA believes that focusing on the timeliness aspect of material cyber incident reporting misses the bigger question, one which may underlie the conundrum noted by the SEC staff in discrepancies between cyber incident reporting on 8 K and 10 K forms  how and when should an organization determine the materiality of a cyber incident? Therefore, we believe the SEC should provide clearer guidance in this area concurrent with, if not before, implementing a four day disclosure requirement.   Request #21: As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures?  IIA Response: On p. 60, the SEC indicates that the average affected filer had total assets of $14.1 billion and a market capitalization of $5.6 billion in 2020. While we would not oppose this proposal, per se, we believe it is highly unlikely that any SEC registrants would not have established any cybersecurity policies or procedures. Therefore, we recommend that the SEC focus on ensuring that those cybersecurity policies and procedures are tested, and their effectiveness validated through a properly resourced and positioned independent assurance function. Doing so will enhance the trust that all stakeholders can have in the information they are given regarding the organizations management of cybersecurity risks and the occurrence and impact of cyberattacks.  Request #38: Should we amend Form 20 F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form 6 K, as proposed, to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic? Are there unique considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts? IIA Response: For the Form 20 F amendments, which would require foreign private issuers (FPIs) to disclose the same information as Items 106(b) and (c) of Regulation S K [see Request #17] would require for domestic registrants, The IIAs response is the same as to request #17. In short, disclosures of the existence of policies and procedures are not as beneficial to stakeholders as the implementation of a well designed system of checks and balances to ensure an organizations strategic, operational, reporting, and compliance objectives are achieved. For the Form 6 K amendments, which would ask FPIs to report cybersecurity incidents the same as proposed changes to Form 8 K for domestic registrants, The IIAs response is the same as to request #1. In short, the SEC should develop guidance for determining the materiality of a cyber incident before or concurrent with implementing a four day disclosure requirement.   Page 5 of 6  Request #43: Would both types of the proposed disclosure, cybersecurity incident disclosure and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure, increase the vulnerability of registrants to cybersecurity incidents? Would this effect be mitigated by any of the other effects of the proposal, including indirect effects such as registrants potential strengthening of cybersecurity risk management measures? What would be the impact of the proposed disclosure on the likelihood of future incidents for registrants? Would that impact be the same for both types of disclosure?  IIA Response: Similar to our response to request #17, The IIA expects that SEC registrants would prefer to keep the details of cybersecurity risks and controls confidential. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether such reporting requirements ultimately agreed to would result in increased vulnerability for the registrants. As stated before, The IIAs position is that the best way to manage an organizations unique cyber risks is to: align processes with widely adopted guidance; actively participate in law enforcement efforts that can strengthen the control environment for all stakeholders; and support those efforts with independent internal assurance that conforms with the IIA Standards.  Request #19: The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. We could define the term to mean, for example: any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would better define cybersecurity?  IIA Response: The IIA would support efforts by the SEC to standardize definitions of cybersecurity, as long as the Commission works closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Office of the National Cyber Director, and other relevant departments and agencies to ensure government wide consistency.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: File No. S7 09 22; Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Dear Ms. Countryman: We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) proposed rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies (the Cybersecurity Reporting Proposal). Our firm is the premier provider of legal services to technology, life sciences, and growth enterprises worldwide. We represent over 300 public companies and have represented over 300 issuers in initial public offerings since 1998. We regularly advise public companies and their officers and directors regarding cybersecurity oversight and governance, as well as the response to and disclosure of security incidents. We recognize cybersecurity is important, increasingly discussed in the boardroom, and further guidance from the Commission is helpful and welcome. We generally support the Commissions efforts to improve the consistency, quality and timeliness of disclosure related to cybersecurity governance, risk management, and incidents; however, we believe that certain aspects of the Cybersecurity Reporting Proposal are problematic, could harm companies experiencing an incident, their shareholders or others, and could undermine law enforcement investigations and companies cybersecurity programs. Comments Regarding Proposed Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K We support the proposal that the trigger for notification should be the determination of a material cybersecurity incident. The Commission is proposing to amend Form 8 K to add a new Item 1.05 that would require disclosure of specific information about a material cybersecurity incident. We agree with the Commissions determination that the trigger for an Item 1.05 Form 8 K should be from the date on which a cybersecurity incident is determined to be material. Investigations of cybersecurity incidents often do not follow a linear path, and new findings and developments are often identified as the investigation unfolds. When companies �������� �������� ��� ������������������������������������ Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 2 are first alerted to a potential cybersecurity incident, the scope and extent of the incident often are not immediately obvious, and it can take time to investigate and determine whether a cybersecurity incident could have a material impact on the company. As such, we support the Commissions proposal that the trigger for an Item 1.05 Form 8 K should be the date on which the cybersecurity incident is determined to be material. We believe that proposed Item 1.05 should permit reporting delays, such as where disclosure could disproportionately harm the company and its shareholders. The Commission recognizes that many state laws permit delayed reporting incidents at the request of and in support of law enforcement investigations, but ultimately rejects reporting delays for purposes of not interfering with ongoing law enforcement investigations even when doing so may hinder law enforcement efforts. However, the Commission does not consider whether the disclosure of an ongoing incident prior to remediation could cause further harm to the company and its shareholders. In cases of nation state actors or other advanced persistent threats (APTs)  one of the most significant threats to U.S. companies it is unlikely that a company will successfully and comprehensively isolate and eject such attackers from its systems prior to determining the materiality of the incident or within four days after that determination. These sophisticated attackers may have the resources to create multiple points of entry to a companys network and move laterally across systems. By creating multiple means of access, such attackers can build persistence, such that if one point of access is cut off, the attacker can return through another method. Alerting the attacker to the companys knowledge that the attacker is in the companys systems can result in the attacker ceasing activity but leaving multiple backdoor points of access, so that the attacker can easily return when an investigation has ceased.  When conducting an investigation of sophisticated attackers, such as an APT attack, industry standard advice of leading forensic companies is for companies to avoid using corporate communications to discuss the discovery of the attacker because many APTs monitor corporate communications to ensure that they continue to operate unnoticed. Requiring companies to disclose the discovery of a material APT attack prior to ensuring the attack has been contained and remediated could cause further material harm to the company, requiring board members to choose between their reporting obligations and their fiduciary duties to shareholders. In addition, by tipping off an attacker that a company is aware that the attacker is in the companys systems, an attacker can react in a manner that harms individuals. In the case of ransomware attacks, many attackers steal data before encrypting the companys systems and data, threatening to post the data on the dark web, if the affected company does not pay a ransom. Even companies that have no intention of paying a ransom may desire to inform affected individuals and offer such individuals identity theft protection services before the stolen data is posted on the dark web. Having only four days after determining that a cybersecurity incident is material may be insufficient time to review stolen data to determine who is affected, procure identity protection services, and provide notice to affected individuals. Hindering the companys ability to mitigate potential harm to affected individuals could exacerbate the potential exposure to the company, which in turn, could cause further material reputational and other types of harm to the company and its shareholders. �������� �������� ��� ������������������������������������ Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 3 Furthermore, a company may have to disclose a cybersecurity incident that still has active vulnerabilities, which could exacerbate the severity of the incident as other potential attackers could become aware of such vulnerabilities and try to exploit them.  We believe that rushed disclosure may impact the completeness and accuracy of the disclosure. In addition, there is a risk that disclosures that are rushed may be too broad and generic or, even more problematic, incomplete, inaccurate and potentially misleading. In his statement supporting the Cybersecurity Reporting Proposal, Chair Gensler stated, When companies have an obligation to disclose material information to investors, they must be complete and accurate. Their disclosures also should be timely. However, it is often the case that an investigation uncovers new findings as the investigation develops. If there are disclosure obligations before facts are fully understood, a company may run the risk of making statements that quickly turn out to be inaccurate, or, out of fear of making an inaccurate statement, may not provide disclosures that are as fulsome or helpful to investors as the company would otherwise make after having some time to investigate and obtain a more complete understanding of the incident. We suggest that companies, with the option to consult with government agencies with deep cybersecurity experience, as helpful, be the appropriate decisionmakers on the propriety of delayed disclosure. The Commissions request for comments on the Cybersecurity Reporting Proposal suggests that the Attorney General could be granted authority to delay disclosure. The Attorney General is not the appropriate entity to make this determination for two reasons: (1) s/he is not in the best position to determine the best interests of the company or its shareholders, and could be motivated by other interests, and (2) the Department of Justice is not the primary, or even the lead, organization in the federal government for cybersecurity response, rather the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is often the first call that companies make, and it has independent authorities. For defense contractors, the Department of Defense is likely to have the highest interest in the timing of an announcement. Ultimately, however, the board of directors is best suited to determine whether a delayed disclosure is in the best interests of the company, and the Commission should empower the board of directors to decide whether additional guidance from government agencies would be helpful. If the Commission decides the involvement of a government agency is prudent, we recommend that the Commission take an approach similar to the Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) approach to ransomware payments. Similar to how OFAC considers a companys report of a ransomware attack to law enforcement to be a significant mitigating factor in determining enforcement outcomes if a ransomware payment is determined to have a sanctions nexus, we recommend the Commission consider a companys consultation with government agencies as a significant factor in support of the propriety of the delayed disclosure. If the Commission proceeds with requiring the Form 8 K disclosure within four business days of determining a cybersecurity incident is material, the Commission should allow board members to decide to delay reporting if doing so could cause material harm to the company. If the board of directors makes such a delay, it should also articulate why the board of directors decided to delay disclosure of the incident. �������� �������� ��� ������������������������������������ Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 4 Comments Regarding Proposed Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise We believe that risk should be managed by the board of directors at the enterprise level, rather than prioritizing cybersecurity expertise over other areas of expertise. We agree with the Commission that cybersecurity is a top priority of many boards of directors, as we frequently advise on such risks with board members of our clients. However, board members are expected to manage a wide range of risks that companies face, from cybersecurity risk to geopolitical risks to climate risks to regulatory and litigation risks. Aside from financial expertise, the Commission does not require companies to disclose board members who have specialized expertise in other areas of risk management.  Requiring disclosure of cybersecurity expertise distinguishes cybersecurity as though it is a risk that should be managed differently and not within a broader understanding of enterprise risk management. This approach goes against established guidance to companies to integrate and assess cybersecurity risks as part of its overall enterprise risk management. Further, tools, such as National Institute of Standards and Technologys (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, are designed specifically to enable non cybersecurity experts to manage cybersecurity risk at the executive level. Moreover, although the proposal includes a safe harbor from liability for board members that are designated as cybersecurity experts, this requirement may unfairly intensify scrutiny on such board members if a material incident occurs. We believe that proposed Item 407(j) may cause companies to prioritize cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors to the detriment of other cybersecurity measures and other desired experience. Proposed Item 407(j) also may negatively impact overall cybersecurity across companies. Cybersecurity standards like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Center for Internet Security (CIS) Top 20 Critical Security Controls, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, and Service Organization Controls (SOC) all follow a risk based approach to cybersecurity. The opportunities to enhance cybersecurity programs and purchase more tools and software are limitless while budgets are not. With this disclosure requirement, companies may feel additional pressure to spend more money and resources on having a board member with cybersecurity expertise, even at the expense of other cybersecurity initiatives that might make the company more secure. This requirement may tip the scales on this particular and specific control in a way that does not actually consider the specific risks to the company and the best ways to remediate those risks. A 2022 industry survey recently reported that only 11% of S&P 500 directors disclosed cybersecurity expertise, which suggests there already is a shortage of cybersecurity expertise among board members.1 This issue may be exacerbated by more companies competing to find members with cybersecurity expertise on their boards of directors, which may make it even more challenging, and thus more expensive, to bring in and retain such board members.    1 MyLogIQ. (March 2022). Company IQ Cybersecurity Oversight Benchmarking Report, available at Files.mylogiq.com/Link_Files/ReportFiles/Cybersecurity%20Oversight%20Benchmarking%20Report%20Marc h%202022%20.pdf. �������� �������� ��� ������������������������������������ Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 5 In addition, as companies attempt to create balanced and effective boards of directors with the appropriate experience needed for their specific situation, the required disclosure may put pressure on companies to prioritize candidates with cybersecurity experience over other desired qualifications, whether based on their industry, regulation or shareholder requests. We believe that Proposed Item 407(j) should be broader, such as providing disclosure of how the board of directors obtains sufficient cybersecurity expertise and expanding on the list of qualifications for cybersecurity expertise. While we do not contest that the board of directors should dedicate specific time and energy to cybersecurity risk, specific technical expertise on the board of directors is not required to do so. Similar to how the board of directors of a company with broad international exposure may hire a geopolitical advisor to help it assess geopolitical risks, board members may choose to rely on third party experts to answer technical questions, while equally and competently managing cybersecurity risks. As such, we recommend that the Commission consider having companies disclose how boards of directors obtain sufficient cybersecurity expertise, rather than narrowly require a member of the board to have cybersecurity expertise.  However, if the Commission chooses to require disclosure of cybersecurity expertise of specific board members, the Commission should broaden the non exclusive list of qualifications. Expertise in areas like incident response, security architecture and engineering, and securities operations do not necessarily translate into skills necessary for enterprise wide cyber risk management (any more so than being a skilled deposer of witnesses makes one prepared to manage a complex trial or being a carbon offset expert makes one qualified to mitigate climate change effects on a companys business). While these specific skillsets demonstrate hands on understanding of portions of cybersecurity, they do not translate into the ability to provide guidance and direction to management on how to prioritize, manage, and transfer risk. Instead, requiring board members to have these specific skillsets may result in the appointment of board members who become focused on specific areas in which they have knowledge rather than on the broader risk management. While serving as a Chief Information Security Officer may be directly on point, skill sets such as risk management in a technology company, serving as a chief compliance or risk officer, or other risk management background are more likely to be relevant than specific technical expertise.  We appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments regarding the Cybersecurity Reporting Proposal.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Via email: rule comments@sec.gov Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File No. S7 09 22  Dear Ms. Countryman: We are submitting this letter in response to the solicitation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) for comments on the Commissions proposed rules (the Proposed Rules) regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. The Proposed Rules were set forth in Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529, published in the Federal Register on March 23, 2022 (the Proposing Release).1  More than twenty years ago, Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP was among the first law firms to establish a dedicated privacy and cybersecurity practice. We regularly work with clients to address a broad range of issues related to cybersecurity, and have been called upon to assist with every phase of data breach management, from preparedness and prevention to mitigation and resolution. We have extensive experience working on cybersecurity matters before the Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, other state and federal law enforcement authorities, state attorneys general, EU data protection authorities, and numerous other foreign government regulators. We have managed more than 2,000 data breaches and cybersecurity events worldwide, and are regularly called upon to provide counsel on highly complex, large scale cybersecurity incidents. Of particular relevance to the Proposed Rules, these engagements frequently require us to advise publicly traded companies and other SEC registrants on their corporate governance and SEC disclosure obligations associated with cybersecurity matters. We respectfully request that the Commission consider the following recommendations for changes and clarifications to the Proposed Rules were they ultimately to be adopted as final rules (as so adopted, Final Rules). In providing these comments, we express no view  1 87 Fed. Reg. 16,590 (Mar. 23, 2022).  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 2  as to the Commissions authority to adopt Final Rules or the administrative rulemaking process more generally. 1. The Commission should refine the definition of cybersecurity incident. The Proposed Rules would define a cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Our principal concern is with the use of the verb jeopardizes, which is a critical element of the overall definition. We believe the term is too imprecise for a Final Rule and should instead be replaced with terminology more clearly indicating actual adverse effect. While the word jeopardize is used in other cybersecurity regimes and is incorporated into the definition of cyber incident in the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, it is not one that appears regularly (if at all) in the Commissions existing regulations or disclosure forms. Jeopardize seems more tenuous and speculative than the Basic v. Levinson materiality test for forward looking statements that calls for a balancing of the indicated probability of an event and its anticipated magnitude.2 In the Proposing Release, the Commission seems to confirm the hypothetical nature of the term by stating, We believe this term is sufficiently understood and broad enough to encompass incidents that could adversely affect a registrants information systems or information residing therein (emphasis added).3 Because jeopardize is not a term of art to securities practitioners, there is no well accepted understanding of the breadth of the verb in the context of disclosure under the federal securities laws. Lacking a common understanding, we believe the subjectivity and ambiguity of the term jeopardize will lead to countless interpretive difficulties whenever disclosure may be required. The use of a materiality qualifier would not by itself, in our view, help to resolve these challenges. Further, use of the term jeopardize may require disclosure of inchoate effects when no actual harm has occurred. Placing something in jeopardy implies creation of the risk of loss or risk of damage, but it does not necessarily follow that actual harm will in fact occur. Item 105 of Regulation S K already provides a thorough treatment of when risk factor disclosure is required in periodic reports and registration statements, and Item 303 already requires disclosure about material uncertainties that is well understood. Generally accepted  2 Basic v. Levinson, 485 US 224, 238 9 (1988). 3 Proposing Release, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,596 n. 58.  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 3  accounting principles require disclosure of loss contingencies. We do not believe the definition here should lead to the disclosure of events that may cause risk but no actual harm.  Accordingly, we do not see a compelling need to create a duplicative disclosure requirement for cybersecurity. Moreover, in the case of disclosure on Form 8 K, the disclosure of a speculative, forward looking event would be inconsistent with the other disclosure items on the form, which uniformly call for the disclosure of historical information that is certain and complete. As alluded to above, we instead recommend that the Commission key a cybersecurity incident off occurrences associated with actual adverse impacts. As such, the revised definition in any Final Rule would read an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes adversely effects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. In this way, the revised definition clarifies that only those unauthorized occurrences that cause harm are the subject of the definition, not merely those occurrences that have the potential to do so. This revision also more closely aligns the definition with the proposed definition of cybersecurity threat, which likewise keys off the concept of adverse effects. 2. The four business day deadline under the proposed revision to Form 8 K is too short.  As currently drafted, Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K would require disclosure within four business days of when a registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident is material. A proposed instruction to this item would require a registrant to make the materiality determination as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. We believe a rapid materiality determination should not be the trigger for disclosure, and instead disclosure should be required no sooner than 30 days after the materiality determination.4  Even before any materiality determination is or could be made, the initial days after discovery of any significant cyber event are often highly tense and a great sense of uncertainty proliferates. Many companies conduct simulations and tabletop exercises in advance to gain a greater sense of preparation, and written cybersecurity incident response plans are becoming more common, but are by no means universal. Even the best prepared companies encounter challenges and difficulties in marshaling a response to an actual incident, with the challenges and difficulties multiplying as the scale of the incident increases.  4 Although our comments in this section are primarily directed at the proposed disclosure requirement under Form 8 K, we believe foreign private issuers also face similar challenges under the Commissions proposed Form 6 K requirement.  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 4 In response, forensic cybersecurity investigators and other outside professionals (including counsel) must be quickly retained. Evidence must be preserved. Breach notification laws must be reviewed and, when applicable, complied with. Identifying the scope of the breach or other incident is often complicated and time consuming, and can take weeks or months to complete. Remedial efforts must begin. Law enforcement must be notified. Insurance claims must be made. When critical operations or infrastructure are impacted, contingency plans must be set in motion to mitigate further business interruption. The presence of ransomware may compel the registrant to open negotiations with the threat actor, which itself is a highly complex issue. These and other critical response steps very much transpire in a fog of war atmosphere. These challenges are magnified when a registrants vendor or another third party is the ultimate target of the breach.  Under these circumstances, adding an additional immediate disclosure obligation is likely to further complicate a registrants response to the incident. Pressure to make disclosure rapidly, before key facts are known and adverse impacts on the business understood, is likely to lead to disclosure that is incomplete or incorrect. In our view, investors do not benefit from imperfect disclosure that must be corrected or then amended subsequently. Further, efforts to contain and remediate the incident or provide assistance to law enforcement could be compromised by premature public disclosure in the detail the Proposed Rules require. In a worst case scenario, premature disclosure could exacerbate an already tense situation.  Rather than compel a hasty disclosure before key facts are understood and impacts appreciated, we believe using a 30 day deadline as the disclosure trigger would mitigate these concerns.5 While state data breach notification laws vary from state to state, 30 days from the cybersecurity incident is the earliest date any state requires that notification to affected persons be made. These state laws recognize and accommodate the practical difficulties of making widespread disclosure in a short period of time. Synchronizing the SEC deadline with state data breach notification standards ensures that the SEC reporting deadline does not precede the first notifications due to individuals or entities whose data may be implicated in the cybersecurity incident.  At the point in time when a cyber incident is remediated, registrants will generally have a much clearer picture of the details surrounding it, such as whether any data was stolen or used for an unauthorized purpose, as well as the effect of the incident on the registrants operations—all items called for under the proposed Form 8 K disclosure. Disclosure made at  5 States with a 30 day deadline include Florida (Fla. Stat. § 501.171(4)(a)) and Maine (10 Me. Rev. Stat. §1348). Other states such as Alabama have a 45 day deadline (Ala. Stat. §8 38 5), and Connecticut has a 60 day deadline, which was recently shortened from 90 days (Conn. Gen. Stat. § 36a 701b(b)).  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 5  this point in time is also less likely to require future revision, and is more likely to provide investors with actionable information to aid them in making future investment decisions. 3. The Commission should not require aggregation of immaterial events for purposes of determining whether a cybersecurity incident has occurred.  Proposed Item 106(d)(2) of Regulation S K would require disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. The Proposing Release notes that such incidents could take a variety of forms, and provides the single example where one malicious actor engages in a number of smaller but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company and collectively, they are either quantitatively or qualitatively material, or both. We do not believe the Commission should require aggregation of immaterial events for purposes of determining whether a cybersecurity incident has occurred.  First, we do not believe disclosure of this information would be decision useful to investors. In our experience, many businesses experience dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of immaterial events on a daily or weekly basis that, when aggregated, may require disclosure under proposed Item 106(d)(2).6 The situation is particularly acute in financial services, for critical infrastructure providers, and for consumer facing industries such as retail and healthcare, but the situation is not unique to them. The volume and frequency of these events, if required to be disclosed in SEC periodic reports, would instead lead to the avalanche of trivial information that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking7 as the Supreme Court has cautioned against. Beyond the single example cited in the Proposing Release, the Proposed Rules provide little additional guidance as to when a series of otherwise seemingly unrelated events should be aggregated. The lack of guidance is surprising since this requirement could easily lead to the largest volume of new disclosure under the Proposed Rules. In most other disclosure contexts under the federal securities laws, the practice of bundling otherwise unrelated, immaterial events for reporting purposes would be unusual and is not generally required. Further, the techniques threat actors deploy are constantly evolving, as are the techniques they use to conceal their true identities. It is not always readily apparent, for example, that a single threat actor is behind a series of otherwise seemingly unrelated events, such as a series of impersonation attacks or a series of credential stuffing attacks. 6 The vast majority of these attempts are repelled through cybersecurity countermeasures, but could still be deemed to jeopardize the confidentiality or integrity of data. 7 TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 US 438, 448 9 (1976).  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 6 Even if the threat actor could be definitively identified, would disclosure be required if it conducted two immaterial attacks six months apart? Six years apart? Would registrants be required to aggregate similar immaterial events occurring over the same time span even if they were demonstrably initiated by different threat actors? These kinds of thorny interpretive questions are likely to become commonplace under proposed Item 106(d)(2), and are also likely to overwhelm both registrants and the Commissions Staff who would routinely be asked to provide interpretive advice.8  Finally, tracking the data necessary to inform the disclosure decision would pose significant technical compliance challenges to many registrants, particularly smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies. While more sophisticated information security functions keep daily event logs and use both manual analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to search for patterns and anomalies, use of these methods is often expensive, time consuming and not uniformly practiced. Even among sophisticated businesses there is much variability in the processes and the outcomes. Further, without detailed guidance from the Commission as to exactly the kinds of situations that would require aggregation, it would be exceedingly difficult for software engineers to design algorithms to identify the kinds of still unclear fact patterns the Commission hopes to capture. Again, smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies are particularly at a disadvantage in this respect.  4. The Commission should not require disclosure around a board cybersecurity expert. Under proposed Item 407(j) of Regulation S K, a registrant would be required to disclose if any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, . . . the names(s) of any such director(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise. We urge the Commission to eliminate this disclosure requirement in any Final Rules. Many boards currently lack a dedicated cybersecurity expert, and with good reason— the ability of the board of directors to provide oversight and monitor compliance in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties is not dependent on having technical subject matter expertise. Boards instead rely on management and outside consultants to develop appropriate cybersecurity policies and procedures, as they are permitted to do under state law. The  8 We see similarities to this kind of fact pattern and others where the Commissions Staff has made a policy decision not to provide any interpretive advice due to the potential volume of requests, the fact intensive nature of the information, resource constraints, and other policy concerns. Examples of these situations in the Division of Corporation Finance include determinations of affiliate status and whether an issuer has perfected a private placement exemption in connection with a non public offering of securities. Any absence of further guidance would compound the problem.   Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 7  Commission oversees disclosure by registrants in countless regulated industries, and does not require each board to make disclosure about the technical or regulatory expertise of board members on an industry by industry or discipline by discipline basis, with the critical exception of the audit committee financial expert, which is a requirement derived from a congressional mandate under the Sarbanes Oxley Act. With the existing requirement of an audit committee financial expert, alongside the proposed requirement for a board climate expert under a parallel Commission rulemaking,9 there exists the potential for at least three separate board experts under Commission rules. Given the vastly different skill sets required for these three compliance specialties, we suspect relative few directors would be able to fill all three positions single handedly. Further, reserving three compliance oriented board seats would continue to tilt the balance away from strategic focused boards and more towards compliance focused ones, which is not a trend we believe is in the best interest of investors.  While risk management and legal compliance are certainly important functions for any board of directors, we do not believe specific cybersecurity expertise is required to discharge those responsibilities. Additionally, we believe management and compliance specialists are better suited to tackling tactical issues involving the specific details of mitigating a given risk factor, including cybersecurity. For some companies, cybersecurity risk is not material to the business, and in those circumstances we question the need to have a designated cybersecurity expert on the board. Naming cybersecurity experts could also have the unintended consequence of placing them personally at risk to malicious action on the part of threat actors. Certain nation states  may place named experts under official surveillance or otherwise harass or persecute them without due process. Hacktivists may try to embarrass the named directors by publishing their personal data or taking unauthorized control of personal computing devices in an effort to discredit a given directors cybersecurity acumen. Named directors may also be placed at other virtual or physical risks, and the prospect of such risk counterproductively may serve as a disincentive to board service in the first place. Moreover, we believe there is a scarcity in the marketplace for technical experts who would satisfy the Commissions proposed criteria for a cybersecurity expert. We believe the proposed criteria to demonstrate cybersecurity expertise are unduly narrow, but we fear that even loosening the criteria substantially would do little to alleviate this shortage of human  9 Release No. 33 11042, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, 87 Fed. Reg. 21,334 (Apr. 11, 2022).  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 8  capital. Those that satisfy whatever technical qualifications the Commission settles on may not satisfy the other wholistic criteria that boards consider when recruiting new directors.  The demands on chief information security officers and cybersecurity forensic investigators, two groups who would most likely satisfy any expert criteria the Commission conceives, may leave them with precious little free time to serve on another companys board of directors. Thus, as a practical matter, we believe the population of eligible candidates is too small to ensure that every reporting company has a board cybersecurity expert. Smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies may struggle to recruit from the limited pool of candidates as those qualified to serve choose the boards of larger or better known companies. While proposed Item 407(j) is crafted so as to not mandate a board cybersecurity expert, we believe most registrants would be hesitant to disclose the absence of one if affirmative disclosure of that fact is required. 5. The Commission should provide for a law enforcement exemption to disclosure. We believe there are many compelling circumstances when potential or ongoing civil or criminal investigations may necessitate a delay in reporting a cybersecurity incident to investors, particularly when national security concerns are implicated. We are therefore concerned that that the Proposed Rules make no allowance for a delay necessitated by law enforcement or national security concerns. In our experience, law enforcement agencies frequently encourage registrants to limit public disclosure pending resolution of a civil or criminal investigation. Premature disclosure of a cybersecurity event may also stress national security or foreign intelligence concerns. Although the needs of investors are certainly important, we do not believe the balance of equities tips in favor of investor disclosure when broader national security issues are at stake. The solution that the Commission sought comment on but did not officially propose— a delay when the Attorney General issues a written determination it is in the interest of national security—is not likely to be workable in practice. We do not believe the Attorney General (or subordinates acting on his or her behalf) would be inclined to provide such a written determination for any number of reasons, such as those involving the confidentiality of the law enforcement process and other law enforcement priorities that may be impaired by written disclosure. As the Proposing Release notes, many state data breach laws provide for a law enforcement exemption, but in our experience the relevant state and federal law enforcement agencies seldom (if ever) provide written instructions when the relevant exception comes into play. Even if the Attorney General were motivated to provide a written instruction (a proposition for which we express substantial doubt), we do not believe the Attorney General would opine on matters outside the Department of Justices jurisdiction, which would include many issues impacting national security that are under the ambit of other  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 9  federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State and the Department of Defense. In addition, we do not believe obtaining written assurances would be possible as a practical matter within the four business day reporting window currently proposed for Form 8 K disclosure. Accordingly, a broader exception is necessary. We do not believe the burden of establishing an exemption from disclosure should fall entirely on individual registrants. On matters truly impacting law enforcement or national security concerns, the Government—not private entities—is best suited to make these nuanced determinations, particularly when the threat actor is a nation state or international criminal syndicate. Ideally, a system of communication among state and federal regulators, including the Commission, would develop such that knowledge by one agency would be imputed to other relevant ones, or one agency would take the lead in notifying the others. Absent a clear congressional mandate to do so, however, we are not optimistic that such a system will develop organically any time soon. Further, we believe that with most data breaches (and particularly those implicating personal information, national security or other sensitive topics), a smaller knowledge group is often preferable to a larger one in the early days of the incident. As an alternative to a Government led notification system, the Commission could develop a confidential reporting system for breach information. Under this approach, a confidential Form 8 K would be filed with the Commission within the prescribed deadline to serve as notice of the cybersecurity incident to the Commission. Doing so would permit the Commission to use the information to further its statutory mission. Such a filing would be subject to confidential treatment automatically, would not immediately appear in the public facing Edgar database, and would be deemed exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act under the exclusions relevant to law enforcement.  At such time as the relevant law enforcement agencies no longer object to public disclosure, the registrant would notify the Commission so that the confidential Form 8 K may be made publicly available in Edgar, in much the same way that confidential draft registration statements become part of the public record within a specified period before other events may occur, such as in that context launching a road show or the date of anticipated effectiveness. To ensure investors are not subordinated to other stakeholders, the proposed confidential filing exemption would not be available if the registrant makes public disclosure through another channel, such as voluntarily through a press release or by another widely dissemination public communication. * * * * *  Ms. Vanessa A.

McGowan, Vice President, Professional Practice, Center for Audit Quality",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128390-291293.pdf,"Page 2 of 11 to play an important role in fostering instructive conversations about cybersecurity risk management, bringing to bear its core values—including independence, objectivity, and skepticism—as well as its deep expertise in providing independent evaluations in a variety of contexts. Public company auditors have been actively engaged in information security for decades, and already provide valued cybersecurity risk management support to their advisory clients. Beginning in 1974, auditors were required to consider the effects of information technology on financial statements.  This evolved into the development of attestation engagements dealing with controls at a service organization, as well as other permissible information security consulting services offered to the market. We are supportive of the transparency that will result through enhancing disclosure by registrants around cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure. As domestic and foreign cybersecurity threats evolve, particularly in the remote and hybrid work environments, timely cybersecurity disclosures are becoming increasingly more relevant and useful to investors and other stakeholders in the financial reporting ecosystem. We provide below details regarding our overall support for the SECs efforts to enhance and standardize cybersecurity disclosures for the benefit of both investors and preparers. Clear, operational guidance for registrants will help to ensure that the increased transparency this rule intends to create results in consistent and comparable disclosures. From the broad perspective we have gained through direct contact with our member firms and our own stakeholder engagement (e.g., chief information officers, internal auditors, audit committee members, academics, and financial reporting executives), we have summarized a number of key observations with respect to the proposed rule. These are organized by thematic area below. Support of enhanced disclosures We support the SECs desire to implement rules that promote consistent, comparable, and decision useful cybersecurity disclosures and the transparency that comes along with it. Over the years, companies have implemented more technology to support their operations which has created opportunities for unauthorized parties to successfully access, manipulate, and steal sensitive data, misappropriate assets, or disrupt operations. Thus, we agree that stakeholders should be sufficiently aware of companies cybersecurity risks, policies, strategy, and governance, and provided with timely material breach reporting information in order to make informed decisions regarding those companies.  Increasingly, investors and other stakeholders in the capital markets are beginning to incorporate cybersecurity considerations into their evaluations of registrants. For example, in February 2021, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) announced methodology changes to its Governance QualityScore rating solution, including the addition of 11 new factors concerning information security  Page 3 of 11  risk oversight and management.1 Similarly, Moodys Investor Service has begun to incorporate cyber risks in firms credit ratings. According to Moodys Managing Director Derek Vadala, [w]e view cyber risk as event risk that can have a material impact on sectors and individual issuers.2 Consistent, comparable information regarding material cybersecurity information is important to inform these stakeholders who interact with the capital markets.  Enhanced cybersecurity disclosures could benefit registrants as well. An academic study also shows that increased disclosure of cybersecurity investments by registrants may decrease their costs of capital. Specifically, it found that, [a] one standard deviation increase in disclosing cybersecurity investments in SEC filings reduces the cost of capital by 7%.3 By disclosing such investments and reducing information asymmetry, registrants may be able to access capital more easily as the perceived risk of investing in these companies decreases with disclosure of improvements to cybersecurity hygiene.  Recommendations for clarity of proposed rule and disclosures  Investments in cybersecurity and efforts to disclose related information come at a cost to registrants, especially if the SECs requirements are not sufficiently clear and operational. Registrants must be able to apply the proposed rule in a manner that provides consistent and comparable information. While the proposed rule, in part, appears to focus on reducing information asymmetry, the Commission should continue to consider how the proposed rule will also influence the behaviors of preparers, investors, and others in the capital markets. Such behaviors, specifically of preparers, ultimately drive disclosure practices required by the proposed rule. The proposed rule should avoid unintended outcomes which may include:   Unnecessary influence over the composition of board of directors;   Incomparable or inconsistent disclosure resulting from the misapplication of the proposed rule by preparers due to lack of clarity in definitions;   Incomparable aggregation of immaterial undisclosed incidents; and,   Unclear expectations related to the timeframe in making incident materiality determinations. In considering historical views of cybersecurity regulations, not all market participants are confident that increased regulation improves cybersecurity practices at registrants. Ernst & Youngs (EY) 2021 EY Global Information Security Survey found that in 2021 only 35% of CISO respondents thought that compliance with then existing cybersecurity guidelines drove the right behaviors within their business, down from 46% in the previous year.4 It also noted that less than one in five respondents describe cybersecurity regulation as an effective way for them to make the case to their boards for additional budget, down from 29% in 2020. While these responses did not contemplate the effects of the proposed rule, it is  1 See Cybersecurity risk disclosures and oversight, EY 2 See Disclosure of Cybersecurity Investments and the Cost of Capital, Havakhor et al  3 Id. 4 See 2021 EY Global Information Security Survey, EY  Page 4 of 11  important that the proposed rule fosters the desired disclosure outcomes by enhancing conduct at the enterprise level. This requires clear and operational rules.  We have also included an appendix to this letter which 1) provides clarification regarding the involvement of the auditor in the disclosure of Other Information including cybersecurity disclosures in Other Information and 2) highlights certain aspects of what assurance over cybersecurity information looks like today and could look like in the future. It also contains educational information regarding a cybersecurity disclosure framework developed by the AICPA which may be useful to registrants. Qualified talent  organizational and board of directors While some companies may have in place reasonable cybersecurity risk management policies, governance structures, and strategies, the disclosure requirements in the proposed rule may require significant investments in personnel. We agree that it is important that registrants have appropriate oversight of their cyber risk management, and its disclosure is relevant to investors. It is also important to recognize that registrants have varying needs in these regards, particularly as it relates to oversight. The board of directors needs to be informed about cybersecurity which can be achieved through certain proposed items in the rule; and while a committee may be responsible for oversight of cybersecurity risk management, the requirement to disclose board member expertise as it relates to cybersecurity may be redundant to other proposed disclosure requirements. Proposed Item 106(c)(1) would require the disclosure of the processes by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks, and the frequency of its discussions on this topic. We believe this disclosure provides investors with sufficient insight into how boards obtain information regarding cybersecurity risks to inform their oversight. This could include board expertise, if necessary, based on the cybersecurity risk profile of a registrant; however, it provides registrants the flexibility for their boards to obtain cybersecurity information in ways that best suit the organizations they oversee. As written, the proposed rule focuses on disclosing cybersecurity expertise at high levels within an organization. Expertise is a higher bar than having sufficient knowledge and understanding of a subject matter. In many cases, boards of directors having sufficient knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity risks (and any other relevant risks) facing the registrants they oversee, rather than specific expertise in one area of focus, gives them the ability to execute appropriate oversight activities. Depending on the cybersecurity risk profile of an organization, a board may be able to obtain relevant cybersecurity knowledge and affirm understanding by having expert individuals within an organization through periodic training, knowledge sharing, and other activities. While board level cybersecurity expertise may be appropriate for certain registrants, for others the board can execute reasonable cybersecurity risk management oversight without having such a specific expertise. It should be at the discretion of registrants to determine the level of board cybersecurity expertise required and the manner which boards obtain such expertise. As boards of directors are generally limited in capacity, requiring disclosure of board cyber expertise may result in boards shifting  Page 5 of 11  their composition to prioritize cyber expertise over other important areas of focus to the detriment of overall corporate governance.  Registrants appear to be naturally moderating levels of board cybersecurity expertise to meet their needs. According to a report by EY, [i]n 2021, 65% of boards [at Fortune 100 companies] disclosed cybersecurity as an area of expertise sought on the board or cited in a director biography, up from 36% in 2018. Notably, a majority (56%) now cite cybersecurity in at least one director biography, up from 44% last year and 27% in 20185. With demand for cybersecurity expertise already on the rise due to natural demand, the implementation of this aspect of the proposed rule may unnecessarily intensify this issue by increasing the demand for such expertise when it is not needed for all registrants. Therefore, we do not believe it is necessary that registrants disclose board expertise regarding cybersecurity.  Definitions Proposed definitions  Section II.D.3 of the proposed rule defines the terms cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity threat (among others) used in proposed Item 106 and proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05. It is important that these definitions are clear and consistent with the definitions and practical applications of such terms in existing or proposed rules, standards, guidance, or other materials put out by the SEC and other standard setting or authoritative bodies.  We do not find that these definitions are sufficiently clear such that all registrants will be able to apply them in a consistent manner. This could have an adverse effect on assessments of materiality, incident disclosures, and other periodic disclosures prepared by registrants. It would be useful for the SEC to clarify these definitions and how they should be applied with practical examples such that they can be operationalized by registrants as intended.  For example, both the definitions of cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity threat refer to the scope of information to be considered for either an incident or a threat to be any information [within an information system].6 This is a very broad term and could be interpreted differently by registrants, detracting from consistent application and disclosure. The definitions would be clearer if instead it qualified such information using common, risk based terminology like confidential, non public, or personally identifiable. The AICPA also defines the term sensitive information7 which encompasses these concepts and others which may be of relevance. Qualifying the types of information for consideration within a cybersecurity threat or incident will provide registrants with a clearer  5 See Cybersecurity risk disclosures and oversight, EY 6 See Section II.D.3 within the proposed rule 7 Sensitive information varies from organization to organization but often includes nonpublic information such as the following: regulatory compliance information; financial information used for both internal and external reporting purposes; confidential sales information, including customer lists; confidential wholesale pricing information and order information; confidential product information including product specifications, new design ideas, and branding strategies; and proprietary information provided by business partners, including manufacturing data, sales and pricing information, and licensed designs. Sensitive information also includes personal information. Information for service organization management, AICPA   Page 6 of 11  understanding of these definitions and focus them on areas of importance and decision usefulness to investors. We also looked to the definitions of these terms included in the SECs proposed rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment Companies, and Business Development Companies (the Proposed SEC Investment Advisor Cyber Rule) which qualifies that the information to be considered as part of a cybersecurity incident or threat is any advisor information [emphasis added]. Advisory information is then separately defined.8 This provides a clearer expectation of the information relevant to a cybersecurity incident or threat. The proposed rule should provide similar clarity.  Consider a situation in which it may be unclear as to whether an incident qualifies as a cybersecurity incident under the proposed definition: A phishing email designed to appear to be from the CFO of a registrant directs the Controller of that registrant to wire a payment to an account controlled by the phishing perpetrator. The controller wires those funds to the perpetrators account.  This may meet the criteria of an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems; however, this incident may not meet the criteria of [jeopardizing] the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Clarity of these definitions is important to ensure comparable application by registrants. Cybersecurity  The proposed rule does not define the term cybersecurity. We recommend that the proposed rule is revised to include a definition for this term in line with the definition established by the National Institute of Standards and Technologys (NIST). This is a well known definition and would be a useful addition to the rule text.  NIST cybersecurity definition9: Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation. Aggregation and continuous reporting Proposed Item 106(d)(2) would require disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. A principles based framework to guide how such aggregation should be performed would lend to consistency and comparability of these disclosures by registrants. This should include examples of when a registrant would or would not aggregate incidents. 8 See Section 275.206(4) 9(c) of the Proposed SEC Investment Advisor Cyber Rule.  9 See NISTs definition of cybersecurity at its Computer Security Resource Center Glossary  Page 7 of 11  The proposed rule does not specify a lookback period over which aggregation should be performed. Preparers may interpret this as going back to inception, going back to initial registration with the SEC, or some other period. Once an aggregate set of immaterial undisclosed incidents is reported, it is not clear if preparers should consider subsequent immaterial cybersecurity incidents for inclusion with those previously disclosed in aggregate or if a new clock starts for aggregating immaterial cybersecurity incidents.  The proposed rule also states,  While such incidents conceptually could take a variety of forms, … they are either quantitatively or qualitatively material, or both. This could be interpreted to mean that dissimilar, undisclosed immaterial incidents, for example a malware attack by Attacker A and an unrelated ransomware attack by Attacker B, should be aggregated to assess for materiality. We are not clear if this is the intent of the Commission; however, we find that this would be impractical given that 1) materiality assessments may vary by incident type and 2) preparers would be significantly challenged to provide clear and comparable disclosures of aggregate incidents without at least some common underlying characteristics. If this is the intent of the proposed rule, examples of the application of this concept will be important to ensure consistent execution by registrants.  In considering the period for which incidents, material either individually or in the aggregate, are disclosed, the proposed rule does not state for how long a registrant must continuously disclose such incidents through periodic reports. We believe that as time progresses, there is a diminishing benefit to decision usefulness in continuous reporting, particularly if the incident has been remediated. Continued disclosure of such incidents may have unwarranted negative consequences on a registrant, for example stock price, capital raising, and reputational impacts. Absent any material changes, additions, or updates to previously reported incidents, the proposed rule should specify for how long previously reported incidents must be continuously disclosed. A framework for aggregation and disclosure timeframe should address the period over which aggregation should be considered, how undisclosed immaterial incidents should be aggregated, and the duration for which continued periodic disclosure is required.  Discovery and materiality determination We support the SECs desire to ensure timely reporting of cybersecurity incidents so relevant stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding their relationships with a registrant. We also acknowledge that the SEC expects registrants to make materiality determinations promptly to support timely disclosure of material incidents. We believe the SEC should provide examples of materiality determination timelines to clarify its expectations.   Page 8 of 11  The text of the release states, we expect registrants to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible. To address any concern that some registrants may delay making such a determination to avoid a disclosure obligation, Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 states a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.10 This may suggest that such determinations should be made more quickly than current interpretive guidance indicates. If the intent of this statement is to accelerate or make more consistent the materiality determination timeline across registrants, we encourage the SEC to revise the proposed rule to include examples regarding what reasonable materiality determination timelines may be as noted in Question 8 of the release. We do not expect that these examples would be all inclusive; however, we believe they would be useful in providing registrants with additional context and factors to consider in making materiality determinations grounded in the facts and circumstances of cybersecurity incidents they may experience. Registrants already evaluate the severity of cybersecurity incidents as they occur; and absent additional guidance, we expect that registrants will continue to use current practices in doing so.  We acknowledge that this language may also be a means to codify current practice. According to a study by Audit Analytics, in 2021, it took, on average, 42.2 days to discover and 79.8 more days to disclose a breach.11 We acknowledge that the disclosure decision is not predicated on the materiality determination proposed in this rule; however, this data shows that even after discovery it takes registrants time and due diligence to assemble information to provide to stakeholders. The time taken is necessary to determine the extent of an incident, assess what information or information systems have been impacted, and ultimately determine whether it has had a material impact on the financial statements and/or internal controls.  At the date of discovery, very little may be known about an incident and registrants may be significantly challenged to conclude promptly whether an incident is material. While the date of the registrants materiality determination may coincide with the date of discovery of an incident, as stated in the proposed rule, we expect that would be rare as most incidents are not simple. The determination of materiality should be thorough and thoughtful such that a registrant does not include inappropriate or incomplete disclosures. Examples may supplement the significant judgements registrants make in cyber incident materiality determinations and could prevent premature disclosure. Premature disclosure could have unintended consequences such as destruction of data by a bad actor, impeding an investigation, or adverse reactions by the capital markets resulting from incomplete information. Registrants should be encouraged to gather and vet meaningful details and context to provide informative disclosures to stakeholders, particularly if a breach is particularly complex or ongoing. Examples of materiality determination and timelines may aid registrants in balancing the need for timeliness and decision usefulness of cybersecurity incident disclosure.  10 See page 22 of the release. 11 Trends in Cybersecurity Breaches Disclosures, Audit Analytics   Page 9 of 11 XBRL  The proposed rule would also require Inline XBRL tagging of cybersecurity disclosures.

Thompson, Board member  Barbara Vanich, Acting Chief Auditor   Page 10 of 11 Appendix  Auditors and Other Information and assurance over cybersecurity disclosures Auditors and Other Information Per the proposed rule, registrants will make these new cybersecurity disclosures in current reports or periodic reports outside of the financial statements. Thus, they are not subject to internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). Rather they will be subject to disclosure controls and procedures and perhaps a reason the requirements are more prescriptive. While the proposed rule would substantially increase disclosures related to cybersecurity, the auditors role in relation to periodic filings by a registrant has not changed. This could increase confusion between what users of financial statements believe auditors do and what auditors actually do with respect to cybersecurity disclosures included in Other Information outside of the financial statements. To clarify, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard 2710, Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements, (AS 2710) describes the auditors responsibilities for disclosures in documents containing the audited financial statements. AS 2710 requires auditors to read the other information in documents containing the audited financial statements and consider whether such information or the manner of its presentation is materially inconsistent with information appearing in the audited financial statements or contains a material misstatement of fact. This involves substantially less work than that required in an audit. Even if a company has extensive disclosures in MD&A about its cybersecurity risk management program, the auditor is not required to perform any procedures in the audit of the financial statements or ICFR to evaluate the appropriateness of the design and implementation of the companys cybersecurity risk management program or its effectiveness or consider the broader cybersecurity risks that may affect the organization, outside of those that affect the audited financial statements.  Assurance over cybersecurity disclosures While registrants are not currently required to obtain assurance over their cybersecurity risk management programs or disclosures, some obtain assurance either voluntarily or as a result of other compliance requirements. Analysts and investors consider information about a companys cybersecurity measures to be important when making investment decisions; Boards of directors may want assurance over information to help fulfill their oversight responsibilities related to their companies cybersecurity programs and the cybersecurity threats; Company management may desire assured information about how business partners (e.g., vendors) with whom they do business manage their cybersecurity risks. To the extent that there is demand from investors, boards of directors, management, or others, public company auditors can provide assurance over cybersecurity risk management disclosures. Auditors, in their public interest roles, play a significant role in the flow of comparable and reliable information for decision making. They bring an objective and independent perspective that can enhance the trust and confidence stakeholders have in cybersecurity information that companies report, and utilize frameworks for the consistent performance of such engagements under established attestation  Page 11 of 11  standards. The CAQs publication, Role of the Auditor in Cybersecurity, provides further details as to the role auditors play in cybersecurity as it relates to the audit of the financial statements and how the auditors role in cybersecurity could evolve beyond the financial statements to meet the needs of stakeholders.  Auditors can perform an examination engagement in accordance with the American Institute of CPAs (AICPAs) attestation standards. In an examination engagement, a public accounting firm uses a multidisciplinary team—made up of professionals whose core competencies can include credentialed IT and information security specialists—to perform the engagement. Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, auditors provide an independent report on whether managements description of the companys cybersecurity risk management program is presented in accordance with the reporting framework and whether the controls within the program were suitably designed and operating effectively to achieve the companys cybersecurity objectives based on that framework. To enable auditors to conduct the examination, the AICPA developed a reporting framework that provides a common approach to communicating, evaluating, and reporting on companys cybersecurity risk management program. The reporting framework, known as Systems and Organization Controls (SOC) for Cybersecurity (SOC for Cyber), includes three key components designed to assist stakeholders in understanding a companys cybersecurity risk management program: (1) managements description of the companys cybersecurity risk management program in accordance with the AICPAs Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program (description criteria), (2) managements assertion that the program meets the AICPAs 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (trust services criteria), and (3) the practitioners opinion. Management can use the description criteria to determine key components of the companys cybersecurity risk management program to communicate in order to meet the information needs of users and the trust services criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the processes and controls within the program. Auditors can use the same criteria to opine on the cybersecurity risk management programs design and on the effectiveness of controls management has designed and implemented to achieve the organizations cybersecurity objectives. The practitioners report may assist boards of directors, senior management, and other pertinent stakeholders as they evaluate the effectiveness of their organizations cybersecurity risk management programs. As noted in the proposed rule, a significant number of cybersecurity incidents pertain to third party service providers and it would require disclosure concerning a registrants selection and oversight of third party entities. The AICPA has established a service which may assist registrants to this end: SOC 2, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy. These reports are intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users that need detailed information and assurance about the controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, and processing integrity of the systems the service organization uses to process users data and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by these systems.",3

(ISC)2 selected several questions that we deemed pertinent to our work and expertise to address in our response.  Page 3  TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive Summary 2 PREAMBLE 3 Responses to Consultation Questions.4 Question 1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants? 4 Question 4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures? 5 Question 18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? 6 Question 21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? 6 Question 22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions?. 7 Question 26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way? 9 QUESTION 30. As proposed, Item 407(j)(1) includes a non exclusive list of criteria that a company should consider in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Are these factors for registrants to consider useful in determining cybersecurity expertise? Should the list be revised, eliminated, or supplemented? . 9 QUESTION 34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) define the term expertise? If so, how should we define the term? . 9 QUESTION 42. Would the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure provide enough information for investors to assess the impact of a cybersecurity incident in making an investment decision? Because the proposed incident disclosure would not require quantification of an incidents impact, would the lack of quantification create any uncertainty for investors which may cause them to under or overreact to the disclosure? Would investors benefit more if registrants were to provide the disclosure after the incidents impact is quantified or can be reasonably estimated? If so, what metrics should be disclosed to help investors understand the impact?. 10  PREAMBLE Page 4  On March 9, 2022, the SEC released its much anticipated proposed rules relating to cybersecurity risk management, incident reporting, and disclosure for investment advisers and funds. The proposal would require a company to report, to the extent known: when an incident was discovered and whether it remained ongoing; a brief description of the incident; what data has been determined to be taken, changed, accessed; how the incident affected the companys operations and; what steps, if any, have been taken to address the situation. It is noted that the SEC does not expect initial disclosures to include specific or technical information about its response plans, its security systems, its networks, its vulnerabilities, or other information that could assist attackers or obstruct remediation efforts. The proposed SEC amendments would also require disclosure of directors cybersecurity ‘expertise.  As the worlds largest nonprofit association of certified cyber security professionals, (ISC)2 strives toward a vision of a safer and more secure cyber world. Core to this vision is that the organizations which power the American economy, such as those that fall under the scope of the proposed SEC rules, operate in a cyber safe, secure and responsible manner. This submission highlights the position of (ISC)2.  RESPONSES TO CONSULTATION QUESTIONS  QUESTION 1. WOULD INVESTORS BENEFIT FROM CURRENT REPORTING ABOUT MATERIAL CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS ON FORM 8 K? DOES THE PROPOSED FORM 8 K DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT APPROPRIATELY BALANCE THE INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF INVESTORS AND THE REPORTING BURDENS ON REGISTRANTS?  RESPONSE: (ISC)2 believes that investors would benefit from reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K. The proposed reporting requirements require disclosure of ‘material cybersecurity incidents within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident1. The proposed rule expands on the SECs 2018 guidance, which, among its points, recommends issuers disclose cybersecurity incidents and risks that would be material to its investors prior to the offer and sale of securities2.  The current and proposed rules are designed to help ensure informed decisions are made by investors regarding cybersecurity breaches. In relation to proposals to amend 8 K, (ISC)2 suggests a ‘material cyber breach be wholly defined and determined as part of the new rules and regulations. Under the proposed Item 1.05 to Form 8 K, ‘material cyber incident is defined as ‘an unauthorized occurrence on  1 1 Form 6 K General Instruction B would be similarly amended to add cybersecurity incidents as a potential reporting event. 2 See Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures at 11, Release No. 33 10459 (Feb. 26, 2018) No. 33 10459 (Feb. 21, 2018) [83 FR 8166]. Page 5  or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Furthermore, the SEC has stated that ‘cybersecurity incident should be interpreted and construed ‘broadly; and may include ‘an accidental exposure of data. (ISC)2 recommends that proposed terms be further defined to be more specific as to which incidents should or could be determined to be ‘material. This would serve to further help organizations determine if an incident is in fact, ‘material. (ISC)2 understands and appreciates that a broad definition is designed to afford companies the flexibility to determine the magnitude of a cybersecurity incident and obtain pertinent details surrounding the incident prior to the start of the 72 hour clock. However, (ISC)2 contends that a more specific definition that articulates the standard of materiality, would as help to curb confusion and doubts as to the relevance of an incident. QUESTION 4. WE ARE PROPOSING TO REQUIRE REGISTRANTS TO FILE AN ITEM 1.05 FORM 8 K WITHIN FOUR BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE REGISTRANT DETERMINES THAT IT HAS EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT. WOULD THE PROPOSED FOUR BUSINESS DAY FILING DEADLINE PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR REGISTRANTS TO PREPARE THE DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER PROPOSED ITEM 1.05? SHOULD WE MODIFY THE TIMEFRAME IN WHICH A REGISTRANT MUST FILE A FORM 8 K UNDER PROPOSED ITEM 1.05? IF SO, WHAT TIMEFRAME WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR MAKING THESE DISCLOSURES? RESPONSE: Disclosure and incident reporting of cybersecurity incidents is a positive step forward. Disclosure of such events will be useful for the public to understand the nature, scope and ramifications of material cyber incidents and the effect those incidents can and will have on both investors and customers.  (ISC)2 believes, however, that premature incident disclosure based merely on the suspicion of a breach, without a complete and adequate assessment of the incident, may be detrimental to both businesses and services supplied by that business. While (ISC)2 contends that reporting of material cyber security incidents is both positive for the public and for data protection, (ISC)2 is concerned that companies suffer unnecessarily on account of notifying based on an incident which is later determined to not be material.  (ISC)2 believes that the proposed timeframe of 72 hours following an incident being determined as ‘material is sufficient time for an initial incident disclosure assuming a business has prepared responses to SEC disclosure requirements ahead of time and has adequate cybersecurity resources in place. This timeframe is consistent with, or more generous than, similar regimes in foreign jurisdictions. In Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has allotted for 72 hours to report an incident under APRA CPS 234.3 Similarly, the European Union has also set forth a 72 hour disclosure period under the GDPR4, as has the UK under its domestic implementation of the GDPR rules.5 In the United States, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, enacted by Congress on March 10, 2022, requires critical infrastructure entities to report cyber incidents to the Department of  3 APRA CITATION 4 GDPR CITATION 5 UK GDPR Citation Page 6  Homeland Securitys (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours of an incident being discovered and to report ransom payments in response to ransomware attacks within 24 hours.6 QUESTION 18. ARE THE PROPOSED DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT, CYBERSECURITY THREAT, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, IN ITEM 106(A) APPROPRIATE OR SHOULD THEY BE REVISED? ARE THERE OTHER TERMS USED IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE SHOULD DEFINE? RESPONSE: (ISC)2 proposes the following definitions to the terms sought under this question: • ‘Cybersecurity incident should be defined as ‘an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through [an advisers or a funds] information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of [an advisers or a funds] information systems or any [adviser or fund] information residing therein. See proposed rules 206(4) 9 and 38a 2. This proposed term is derived from the 44 U.S.C. 3552, which is incorporated into PPD 41 (defining ‘cyber incident) and included in the NIST Glossary (defining ‘incident).7 (ISC)2 believes this term is sufficiently understood and broad enough to encompass incidents that could adversely affect an advisers or funds information systems or information residing therein, such as gaining access without authorization or by exceeding authorized access to such systems and information that could lead, for example, to the modification or destruction of systems and information. • ‘Cybersecurity Threat should be defined as ‘any potential occurrence that may result in an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of [an advisers or a funds] information systems or any information residing therein.8 • ‘Information System should be defined as ‘information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of a registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations.  QUESTION 21. AS PROPOSED, A REGISTRANT THAT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY CYBERSECURITY POLICIES OR PROCEDURES WOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THIS IS THE CASE. IF APPLICABLE, SHOULD A REGISTRANT HAVE TO EXPLICITLY STATE THAT IT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED ANY CYBERSECURITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES? (ISC)2 believes that any organization that employs people and provides services should have security policies and procedures in place. Regardless of these policies being provided and maintained internally or externally, policies should be mandatory to secure confidence. A lack of policies and procedures undermines cyber defenses and leaves all stored and valuable systems vulnerable to attack. The cyber protocols and practices of a business should consider people, process and technology. All three are necessary for a successful practice. Relying too heavily on any one of these could prove detrimental to the business and the information and systems being protected. SEC governed organizations should be mandated to have formal policies and procedures related to cyber (ISMS). 6 Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022  full citation 7  8  Page 7  QUESTION 22. ARE THERE CONCERNS THAT CERTAIN DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER ITEM 106 WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF UNDERMINING A REGISTRANTS CYBERSECURITY DEFENSE EFFORTS OR HAVE OTHER POTENTIALLY ADVERSE EFFECTS BY HIGHLIGHTING A REGISTRANTS LACK OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY? IF SO, HOW SHOULD WE ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS WHILE BALANCING INVESTOR NEED FOR A SUFFICIENT DESCRIPTION OF A REGISTRANTS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS? (ISC)2 recognizes that a balance needs to be found to achieve the goals of transparency and disclosure to allow investors and customers to make informed decisions, and the need for a business to protect their assets, interests and viability. Investing in cybersecurity practices and protocols from a people, process and technology perspective is essential for a business to successfully maintain secure data and systems, maintain the trust of the public and the interests of stakeholders and regulators alike. Disclosure of non essential information could lead to social engineering attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and additional potential harm to organizations and their shareholders. As such, any notifications made by affected organizations should be made in simple language following industry accepted verbiage. Notifications should avoid detailing any specific aspects of an organizations information systems. For example, vendor technology used for cyber defense should not be listed in a notification to ensure that a cybercriminal employing social engineering techniques does not further target an organization with vendor specific vulnerabilities.  (ISC)2 also recognizes that not disclosing enough information could in fact prove detrimental to the reputation of the business and public confidence in the long term. In addressing both investor and registrant concerns around best practice, preventative cybersecurity courses of action, (ISC)2 contends that an organizations cybersecurity posture is entirely reliant on three essential pillars to ensure achieving good outcomes: • The first pillar is an understanding that PEOPLE are the most essential ingredient in any successful cyber security strategy. This involves ensuring that people are aware of the risks, appreciate how those risks can impact their day to day lives and take proactive steps to prevent those risks from eventuating. This involves ensuring that professionals tasked with protecting the information assets of organisations and government are competent, skilled and certified in being able to do so, which is a significant element of what (ISC)2 as an organisation seeks to achieve. This also involves ensuring that these people have access to relevant resources, training and skills that help to provide timely information in an industry that changes by the second. • The second pillar is the understanding that PROCESS needs to exist when seeking to implement strong cyber security measures. Many of the items listed within the terms of reference for this Inquiry relate to process. The adoption of industry standards for the management of information security systems is critical. Many of the recommendations in the Submission discuss this pillar. However, it is vital to emphasise the point that without the PEOPLE in an organisation possessing the right set of knowledge, skills, experience and mindset, any attempt to create processes that minimise the risk will be flawed from the outset. We know this to be self evident. Page 8  Consider, for example, mature industries such as aviation where there is no question that best practice dictates that the people working in the sector are competent, skilled and accredited. • Finally, the third pillar is TECHNOLOGY. We all know that this is a high tech sector. However, (ISC)2 strongly emphasises that the technology functioning as is intended is entirely dependent on the fact that PEOPLE are duly trained, skilled and accredited to deploy, manage and maintain that technology to begin with.  Page 9  QUESTION 26. WOULD PROPOSED ITEM 407(J) DISCLOSURE PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS WOULD FIND USEFUL? SHOULD IT BE MODIFIED IN ANY WAY? (ISC)2 supports proposed item 407(j) and forms the opinion that investors would find it useful. The proposed item does not impose any additional obligations on the directors. Strategically, proposed item 407(j) could prove beneficial as it demonstrates commitment to cybersecurity which would elevate confidence in the organization with the public and other entities. QUESTION 30. AS PROPOSED, ITEM 407(J)(1) INCLUDES A NON EXCLUSIVE LIST OF CRITERIA THAT A COMPANY SHOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DIRECTOR HAS EXPERTISE IN CYBERSECURITY. ARE THESE FACTORS FOR REGISTRANTS TO CONSIDER USEFUL IN DETERMINING CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE? SHOULD THE LIST BE REVISED, ELIMINATED, OR SUPPLEMENTED? (ISC)2 supports the requirement that corporate officeholders, including directors, demonstrate a level of expertise in cybersecurity commensurate with the organizational risk that cybersecurity presents in the digital era. Information risk represents a set of risks that holds the same level of importance in terms of potential impact as financial risk, human risk and other major organizational risks. As such, information security requires a similar level of scrutiny and controls at a board level. (ISC)2 does not contend that all corporate officeholders should be required to become fully accredited cybersecurity professionals. However, (ISC)2 does contend that a nominated director who is tasked with information security responsibilities for the organization should be duly accredited and certified as a cybersecurity professional. (ISC)2 strongly contends that such a director, nominated to hold responsibility for information security should attain and hold a relevant ANSI / ISO / IEC 17024 accredited certification in cybersecurity to adequately demonstrate the requisite levels of expertise in the field. Such a scheme already exists for the US government  the US Department of Defense (DoD) 8570.01M lists a pre defined list of ANSI / ISO / IEC 17024 valid cybersecurity certifications which must be held by all information assurance professionals pursuant to their level of responsibilities and roles. All nine (ISC)2 certifications meet the requirements for eligibility for both the DoD 8140.01 and DoD 8570.01 M at various levels of work roles and responsibilities.  QUESTION 34. AS PROPOSED, ITEM 407(J) DOES NOT INCLUDE A DEFINITION OF THE TERM EXPERTISE IN THE CONTEXT OF CYBERSECURITY? SHOULD ITEM 407(J) DEFINE THE TERM EXPERTISE? IF SO, HOW SHOULD WE DEFINE THE TERM?  Yes. (ISC)2 believes that the term expertise should be defined. (ISC)2 proposes the definition include or be wholly defined as a person who demonstrates advanced or expert skill or knowledge within cybersecurity and who has the ability to perform a task, function or role up to a set of prescribed standards.  (ISC)2 supports the requirement that corporate officeholders, including directors, demonstrate a level of competence in cybersecurity commensurate with the organizational risk that cybersecurity presents in the digital era. Page 10  (ISC)2 does not believe all corporate officeholders should be required to become fully accredited cybersecurity professionals. However, (ISC)2 contends that a director(s) who is tasked with information security responsibilities for the organization should be duly accredited and certified as a cybersecurity professional (ISC)2 strongly contends that such a director, nominated to hold responsibility for information security should attain and hold a relevant ANSI / ISO / IEC 17024 accredited certification in cybersecurity in order to adequately demonstrate the requisite levels of competence in the field such as the Certified Information Systems Security Profession (CISSP). A CISSP certification demonstrates the individual can effectively design, implement and manage a best in class cybersecurity program. Such a scheme already exists for the US government  the US Department of Defense (DoD) 8570.01M lists a pre defined list of ANSI / ISO / IEC 17024 valid cybersecurity certifications which must be held by all information assurance professionals pursuant to their level of responsibilities and roles. All nine (ISC)2 certifications meet the requirements for eligibility for both the DoD 8140.01 and DoD 8570.01 M at various levels of work roles and responsibilities. 11 of the 14 work roles defined in DoDD 8140.01 and DoD 8570.01 M.  QUESTION 42. WOULD THE PROPOSED CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT DISCLOSURE PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION? BECAUSE THE PROPOSED INCIDENT DISCLOSURE WOULD NOT REQUIRE QUANTIFICATION OF AN INCIDENTS IMPACT, WOULD THE LACK OF QUANTIFICATION CREATE ANY UNCERTAINTY FOR INVESTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE THEM TO UNDER OR OVERREACT TO THE DISCLOSURE? WOULD INVESTORS BENEFIT MORE IF REGISTRANTS WERE TO PROVIDE THE DISCLOSURE AFTER THE INCIDENTS IMPACT IS QUANTIFIED OR CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED? IF SO, WHAT METRICS SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO HELP INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT? (ISC)2 believes that incident disclosure is beneficial to members of the public to understand when breaches are material from both an investor and customer perspective. (ISC)2 believes that information sharing contributes to better understanding of the impacts of a breach for a business. Additionally, it helps inform investors and the public.  (ISC)2 holds firm the view that it is critical to demonstrate competent cybersecurity policies and practices are in place. However, (ISC)2 contends that it would be unwise and counterproductive to the purposes of the proposed SEC goals to significantly penalize businesses based on minor timeline infractions. (ISC)2 firmly believes recognition of demonstrated cybersecurity expertise is an important part of cybersecurity, defining cybersecurity competence and encouraging uniform and informed cybersecurity policies, procedures and disclosures. (ISC)2 welcomes the opportunity to support and help define the parameters for rules and requirements on this issue based on our vast expertise and market experience.  (ISC)2 appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the SEC and would welcome an offer to further support and assist on this matter. (ISC)2 looks forward to the decision of the SEC regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.",3

McMahon, Jr., Senior Vice President, Energy Supply & Finance, Edison Electric Institute",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128366-291140.pdf,"Via E Mail (rule comments@sec.gov)  May 9, 2022  Vanessa A. Countryman, Esq. Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release Nos. 33 11038 and 34 94382; File No. S7 09 22  Dear Secretary Countryman:  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed rules. We applaud the ongoing efforts of the Commission to enhance and standardize disclosures on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is the association that represents all U.S. investor owned electric companies. Our members provide electricity for more than 220 million Americans and operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a whole, the electric power industry supports more than 7 million jobs in communities across the United States. In addition to our U.S. members, EEI has more than 60 international electric companies as International Members, and hundreds of industry suppliers and related organizations as Associate Members. Organized in 1933, EEI provides public policy leadership, strategic business intelligence, and essential conferences and forums. Our industry input is based on our extensive experience in addressing cybersecurity risks and attacks against the power grid. EEI recognizes the hallmark principle of U.S. securities laws is transparency and that the statutes and rules are designed to provide investors with the disclosures that they need in order to make informed decisions. EEI and our members support several key elements of the cybersecurity reporting approach contemplated by the Commissions proposal. Cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to our investors and warrants a set of rules and guidelines that are cybersecurity specific. However, it is imperative that the Commission implement rules that recognize the inherent sensitivity of and the need for protection of information regarding cybersecurity, including the risks associated with cybersecurity incident disclosure, and allow reasonable flexibility regarding the governance of cybersecurity within registrants. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 2  Disclosure of cybersecurity information must properly balance the incremental benefits associated with broader disclosure against the known risks that may result from public disclosure.  National Security and Law Enforcement  Consideration should be given to national security and law enforcement. While broad disclosure of information on cybersecurity incidents may hold some value to investors, paradoxically it disproportionately benefits sophisticated adversaries and other malicious actors. Whether they are nation state cyberterrorists or something less coordinated, malicious cybersecurity actors are constantly monitoring and scanning for vulnerabilities, weaknesses, potential attack vectors, and cyber targets. Public disclosure of a cyber incident, especially before the incident is mitigated, provides details on vulnerabilities and attack vectors that become a useful roadmap for malicious actors, which makes the registrant, and others, a target for ongoing or similar attacks. The proposed SEC rules must strike the proper balance between enhancing transparency of cyber incidents for investors, on the one hand, and avoiding disclosure of information that is not useful to investors or can facilitate malicious actor efforts to jeopardize national security or the efforts of law enforcement, and particularly the integrity and reliability of the electric grid.  Our industry is one of the sixteen critical infrastructure sectors identified by the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA further states that, without a stable energy supply, health and welfare are threatened, and the U.S. economy cannot function. Presidential Policy Directive 21 identifies the Energy Sector as uniquely critical because it provides an ‘enabling function across all critical infrastructure sectors.1 As such, the safe and reliable operations of the electric grid is a primary consideration when analyzing the risks associated with disclosing potentially sensitive operational details. Given the critical nature of our members operations, they also are likely to possess some of the nations most critical confidential information, including cybersecurity threat information furnished by government entities, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Security Agency (NSA). Many of the information sharing agreements and requirements between our members and these entities preclude the sharing of certain information with any outside stakeholders, let alone publicly with investors. In these situations, registrants should not be liable for not filing an Item 1.05 Form 8 K or failing to make similar disclosures that could jeopardize national security interests.  There are additional considerations when individuals with security clearance who work for registrants receive sensitive information, such as by National Security Letter or notification of a breach through the Sector Specific Agency, which for our sector is the Department of Energy (DOE), or a law enforcement agency. These individuals would be forbidden under penalty of criminal law from disclosing this information. The conflict between criminal law and regulation must be addressed for disclosure requirements to be reasonable. 1 U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) (https://www.cisa.gov/energy sector). Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 3  Consideration also should be given to situations where related information may be considered less sensitive, although still confidential and subject to jurisdiction by a registrants Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA), which also is DOE for our industry. We suggest that our members be permitted the flexibility to work with such agencies to properly assess the risk associated with disclosure of potential information, and file delayed, redacted, or no disclosure, as appropriate.  The Sensitivity of Cybersecurity Information Favors a Balanced Approach to Disclosure  EEI members provide safe, affordable, reliable, and secure electric service to their customers.  Electric companies have robust existing regulatory requirements pertaining to cybersecurity protection and incident reporting, including DOE requirements and the requirements developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which are also enforced by NERC and FERC.2 Electric companies are committed to compliance with these and other standards. Violations of NERC requirements are subject to significant fines, and the focus of the incident reporting is compliance with NERC standards and protection of the bulk power system, rather than review in public. Other federal agencies  particularly but not exclusively those charged with oversight of critical infrastructure  consistently have taken considerable measures to protect exposure of information about critical infrastructure that could be valuable to attackers. For example, NERC and FERC do not publicly disclose certain sensitive information regarding the security of the bulk power system that could otherwise be available to bad actors.3 Indeed, greater disclosure could create a forum for bad actors to aggregate and analyze data related to cyber system weaknesses in general or, when combined with other publicly available information, may help an attacker. Given the highly technical nature of the electric grid, its complex operations, and the sensitivity of the information that is required to maintain its security, public disclosure of cybersecurity information carries significant risks for the security and reliability of the electric grid.  The interest in transparency for investors must be balanced against the associated security and electric reliability risks that flow from public disclosure of sensitive cybersecurity information (e.g., Critical Energy/Electric Infrastructure Information (CEII) and other regulated data), recognizing that disclosure of cybersecurity information creates additional risk that adversaries can use to better target their attacks on a specific registrant or to take advantage of trends or other  2 See, e.g., Reliability Standard (Critical Infrastructure Protection) CIP 008 6 — Cyber Security — Incident Reporting and Response Planning which requires electric companies to mitigate the risk to the reliable operation of the bulk electric system as the result of a Cyber Security Incident by specifying incident response requirements. https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/CIP 008 6.pdf. 3 See, generally, FERC and NERC Second Joint Staff White Paper on Notices of Penalty Pertaining to Violations of Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards, September 23, 2020, available at https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020 09/Second%20Joint%20White%20Paper_CIP%20NOP%20Confidentiality_09.23.2020_AD19_18_000_0.pdf  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 4  vulnerabilities.4 FERC and DOE have established procedures for how they designate, protect, and share CEII.5 Cybersecurity information is often highly technical, extremely sensitive, and requires specialized training and expertise to understand, reducing its value for investment decisions; however, attackers who do have the specialized knowledge, expertise, and malign intent may be able to use this information to target specific electric companies and the electric grid in general. Further, broad publication of this information before an incident or vulnerability has been mitigated encourages further attacks against the registrant or other targets that may share a similar vulnerability, which could result in disastrous consequences to the registrant, their customers, and their investors, as well as more broadly the electric subsector.  Information should not be required to be shared publicly if a registrant believes that there is a reasonable risk that the disclosure will expose it or others to ongoing or additional risks of cyber attacks. The SEC proposal requires registrants to disclose a significant amount of cybersecurity detail. For example, the SECs proposed addition of Item 106(d)(2) would require a registrant to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. According to the SEC, registrants would be required to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both individually and in the aggregate. The SEC would require registrants to disclose the following elements if incidents become material in the aggregate: 1. When the incidents were discovered and whether they are ongoing. 2. A brief description of the nature and scope of such incidents. 3. Whether any data was stolen or altered. 4. The impact of such incidents on the registrants operations and its actions. 5. Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incidents. While that level of information may potentially be useful to investors, it might be devastating to a registrant while a cyber attack is still underway. Diverting time and valuable resources to create a report while the registrant is trying to mitigate the incursion creates additional risk as the same resources are likely to be drawn on for both efforts. Additionally, the requirement to evaluate past incidents continually to determine whether the materiality threshold is met would further distract resources that should be focused on the more immediate need of securing the system. Aside from publicly disclosing the registrants awareness of the attack to the attacker, which may be undesirable or may be contrary to the requests of federal agencies such as the DHS or the FBI, doing so possibly invites other attacks.  4 The Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) added section 215A to the Federal Power Act, which authorizes both the Secretary of Energy and the FERC to designate information as CEII. 129 Stat. 1312. CEII is a category of controlled unclassified information about a system or asset of the bulk power system, whether physical or virtual, that if destroyed or incapacitated, would negatively affect the United States national security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of such effects. 5 Critical Electric Infrastructure Information; New Administrative Procedures, 85 Fed. Reg. 14756 (2020).  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 5  There may be value in providing certain information to investors, but it should not come at the expense of ensuring a reliable and secure electric grid. Registrants should be allowed to weigh the benefits of sharing incremental information with the public against the potential national security or public safety consequences that would result from a cyber incident.  Proposal on Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents  We recognize the importance of reporting material cybersecurity incidents to investors, and we generally support the proposal to require registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents in a current report on Form 8 K within four business days after a materiality determination is made, subject to the certain liability protections and exceptions we are suggesting the Commission adopt. However, given that all cybersecurity incidents are not created equally, the disclosure requirements need to be carefully limited to material information and to information that will not further the risks described above. Below are a few specific suggestions:  • We propose that a new Section 1.05(c) be added to Form 8 K that would read as follows:  (c) No disclosure under Item 1.05(a) shall be required to the extent that (i) such disclosure is prohibited by the rules of, an agreement with, or written instructions from an appropriate governmental authority, or (ii) the registrant in good faith concludes that its disclosure will expose it or others to ongoing or additional risks of a cybersecurity incident.  Note that this limitation applies only to the extent that disclosure would trigger either clause (i) or (ii). As a consequence, some disclosure likely still would be required, but disclosure that would have an adverse impact would not be. • We also propose that a new instruction to Item 1.05 be added that would read as follows:  4. The appropriate governmental authorities referenced in Section 1.05(c) would include the agencies, commissions, departments and authorities of Federal or state governments with authority over the registrant, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, with respect to cybersecurity, the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, and the enforcement of cybersecurity laws. • We suggest that the SEC refine Item 106(d)(1)(ii) so that it covers only any future impacts . . . that the registrant believes are reasonably likely to be material. Our concern is that the proposed standard uses the word potential, which is all encompassing and does not, on its face, exclude unlikely or low probability outcomes.  • We suggest that the SEC refine Item 106(d)(1)(iii) to clarify that it requires disclosure of only material remediation. In the ordinary course it is typical to respond to major Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 6  cybersecurity incidents for an almost indefinite period, often in immaterial ways6. It should be clarified that immaterial remediation does not require disclosure, as such information is not valuable to investors. • The new rules should permit registrants to defer follow on disclosure until remediation is sufficiently complete such that disclosure would no longer increase the risk of further harm to security or reliability. Consistent with the language that we propose for Item 1.05(c) of Form 8 K, we suggest that a new paragraph be added to Item 106 that would read as follows:  (c) No disclosure under Item 1.05(a) shall be required to the extent that (i) such disclosure is prohibited by the rules of, an agreement with, or written instructions from an appropriate governmental authority, or (ii) the registrant in good faith concludes that its disclosure will expose it or others to ongoing or additional risks of a cybersecurity incident.  • We also propose that a new instruction to Item 106 be added that would read as follows:  The appropriate governmental authorities referenced in Section 106 would include the agencies, commissions, departments and authorities of Federal or state governments with authority over the registrant, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, with respect to cybersecurity, the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and the enforcement of cybersecurity laws. • For the reasons noted above, we suggest the SEC limit Item 106(d)(1)(iv) to material changes. • We suggest that the SEC limit Item 106(d)(2) disclosures to a series of related and previously undisclosed cybersecurity incidents and ones occurring within the two year period prior to the filing7. Otherwise, the unspecified, and therefore open ended, time period would require an unwarranted tracking effort and potentially produce reports on an aggregation of incidents over a lengthy period of time that likely have no current relevance to investors and that may not bear relation to each other.  • We also strongly urge that the final rule maintain the current proposed standard that untimely filing of an Item 1.05 Form 8 K Item does not affect Form S 3 eligibility.   6 For example, a registrant may, following a Form 8 K report of a cybersecurity incident, among other actions, require more frequent password changes. Clearly that does not warrant coverage in a Form 10 Q or Form 10 K. 7 Some registrants do not currently track incidents in a way that would enable their aggregation. Even a two year requirement would need to be phased in.  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 7  Proposal Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise Investors are increasingly asking for enhanced disclosure by registrants regarding oversight of cybersecurity. Specifically, we have heard calls from investors for a disclosure of a qualitative discussion of the role of the board of directors in establishing cybersecurity policy and in overseeing its implementation. We agree with the Commission that investors are interested in knowing that registrants and their boards are taking cybersecurity seriously and addressing the risks comprehensively. We believe, however, that disclosure about whether any members of the registrants board of directors have cybersecurity experience or expertise is best located in proxy statements, where other corporate governance related information currently is disclosed and where many issuers already discuss board cybersecurity oversight and expertise.  Proposal Regarding Managements Role and Expertise  We are concerned that the proposal focuses too much, either directly or by implication, on the granular components of a registrants cybersecurity structure and the experience and expertise of management. Structures, in themselves, are not indicative of good processes, and company personnel will change over time, particularly within an IT structure, making some of the proposed disclosures potentially obsolete shortly after filing. Moreover, the detailed information called for is not information that is important to investors. We expressly asked a broad range of both buy side and sell side analysts covering electric and gas utilities what disclosure they would like to see, and their message has been consistent: They do not want the granular details; rather, they want an overview that provides them assurance that appropriate attention is being paid to cybersecurity issues by management and the board. As a result, we suggest that Item 106(c)(2) be simplified to read as follows:  Describe generally the structure within management that oversees the registrants cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies, including, if not disclosed elsewhere, the general processes through which cybersecurity incidents are identified, reported among management, the board, regulators, and the public, and remediated. We also do not believe that the identification of individuals or their credentials is warranted.  This disclosure could further subject registrants to social engineering campaigns8 by specifically identifying their key players to bad actors. We suggest that the rules require a high level description of cybersecurity oversight and monitoring rather than a detailed description or organizational chart.   8 Social engineering campaigns orchestrated by outside actors use deception to manipulate key people into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. Social engineering campaigns utilize a variety of methods such as phishing (spear phishing, whaling, pharming, etc.) and vishing. Phishing attacks attempt to obtain personal or sensitive information through electronic communications and have become very sophisticated. The more information the outside actors have about a target entitys employees, the more likely the outside actors will be able to identify vulnerabilities and target them successfully. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 8  Further Recommendations  Unnecessary Exposure to Liability  We believe the Commission may be underestimating the sophisticated analysis and subjective judgment required to determine whether a material cyber incident has occurred and to determine what disclosures may be required. Even determining that a cybersecurity incident has occurred (as contrasted with a simple IT failure) may depend on a forensic investigation, and the scope and impact of the attack may take weeks or even months to determine with accuracy, with a high possibility that initial conclusions later may be proven to be incorrect. History has demonstrated that there is a low probability that any entity will have an accurate grasp on the nature and scope of an incident until weeks or months after discovery.  The SEC proposals would require registrants to weigh the need to disclose information about a material cyber security incident as soon as possible to assure deadline compliance and avoid liability against (a) potentially erroneous disclosure of what initially was believed to be a material cybersecurity incident that is subsequently determined to be immaterial, (b) failure to disclose what is not initially believed to be a material cybersecurity incident but that is later determined to be material, and (c) being punished for failing to predict the rapid evolution of knowledge during the initial time immediately following determination of a presumed cybersecurity incident. Moreover, the consequences of being wrong could be severe, particularly where a registrant has an active 1933 Act registration statement that incorporates Forms 8 K by reference and elevates any liability from liability based upon Rule 10b 5 (and similar provisions) to liability based upon Sections 11 and 12.  As a result, we suggest that the Commission provide that any Item 1.05 Form 8 K (and related Form 10 Q and Form 10 K disclosures) be deemed furnished and not filed for liability purposes. This approach has passed the test of time in other contexts, is appropriate in this context as well, and could result in more disclosure, given filed may limit disclosure given the incremental legal liability.  Moreover, there should be no private right of action with respect to Item 1.05 Forms 8 K. We support the Commissions goal to provide for prompt disclosure and transparency, but the Commission should not invite the creation of a new cottage industry of plaintiffs firms filing class action securities litigation after every cyberattack. We appreciate that the goal of the new rules is to encourage more transparency around cyber incidents. Permitting private rights of action may have the opposite effect, however, by encouraging registrants to wait longer—until they have more certainty about cyber incidents—to avoid lawsuits alleging misstatements where registrants initial disclosures reflected a misunderstanding, or simply an incomplete early understanding, of the facts. Furthermore, if the Commissions intent is investor awareness or the provisioning of information and not liability, there should be no punishment in the form of private actions for disclosure at the earliest available opportunity. Of course, the Commission always has the ability to enforce its rules as it deems appropriate, as ample investor protections would exist.  Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022  Page 9  We also suggest that the Commission require that any reporting obligations under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K be predicated on a determination of materiality by the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or senior most individual employed by a registrant who directly oversees cybersecurity. In reality, individuals working within a registrants IT operations often will be the first to discover a potential incident, but even with the best procedures and training they are not in a position to make a materiality assessment or for a registrant to be bound by any materiality assessment that they might make. The mandatory disclosure obligations in this type of real time context should reflect that.  Conclusion  As noted above, we commend the Commission for its efforts to enhance cybersecurity disclosures and appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposals. Given the prominence of cybersecurity risks facing public companies today, it is essential that the Commission issue clear rules on guidance on the matter that carefully balance the value of sharing additional information with investors against the enhanced cybersecurity risks that come with public disclosure of sensitive information. EEI and its officers would be happy to discuss any questions on our recommendations at the Commissions convenience. Respectfully submitted,   Richard F.

Countryman  Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street NE  Washington, DC 20549 1090  File Number S7 09 22  rule comment@sec.gov  Dear Secretary Countryman,  We are writing in response to the Proposed rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance,  and Incident Disclosure, and to express our broad support for it.  As background, Blue Lava is a security program management company built with, by and for the  cybersecurity community. The company was founded on the premise of the increasing alignment of  security programs to the business.  Cybersecurity program management is a critical capability for any organization  so it can measure,  manage, and communitie the effectiveness of their program. Enabling executives to speak in the  language of the business about their cybersecurity program management with confidence and ease is  essential in todays digital world.  We consider having cybersecurity policies and procedures foundational to an organization  like  breathing. And without proper governance, policies and procedures are useless when no one is  accountable for their enforcement. A cybersecurity program must include other facets of the organization just like you would any other business function:  ●  Operations  ●  Support  ●  Strategy  ●  Necessary funding (based on industry, size of company, and geography)  This is why a deep level of visibility into a holistic cybersecurity program is a critical function of building,  supporting, and reporting on a cybersecurity program.  Our experience provides an important and essential perspective for responding to your request for  feedback proposing policy changes that can advance the cybersecurity industry.  We have listed our responses below. We are available to meet and discuss our responses in greater  detail, and are willing to support and engage with you and the broader cybersecurity community to ensure  the proposed rule has the intended positive effects.  Very Best Regards,  David Walter  CEO, Blue Lava What follows is our responses to the questions you posed which we felt most comfortable answering.  17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants  cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item  106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should  we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements?  ●  We feel that 106(b) and (c) should be adopted in order to ensure that organizations have the right  governance, oversight, and supporting cybersecurity investments with respect to people, process,  and technology.  ●  However, providing more consistent and informative disclosure regarding an organizations  cybersecurity risk management and strategies is going to be challenging for a few reasons:  ○  First, the industry has been focusing on compliance frameworks, not cybersecurity  program management. Compliance and cybersecurity are not the same thing, and a  cybersecurity centric framework and methodology that is continuously updated and  managed throughout the year (not a point in time) would yield much more tangible and  consistent insights.  ○  Secondly, the current reporting at the Board level is usually through the lens of potentially  outdated frameworks, which may be missing some key elements necessary to a holistic  view of a cybersecurity program  specifically: Fraud, Account Takeover, Cloud Security,  and Application Security.  ●  We recommend adopting a common language to support the ability to communicate or report on  cybersecurity efforts consistently. A cybersecurity centric holistic framework would help address  that. It would need to reflect modern cybersecurity practices and domains, create simple and  common language that can be applied across industries and understood by both technical and  non technical executives, and be flexible enough to adapt to shifts in technology and the threat  landscape.  18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and  information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used  in the proposed amendments that we should define?  ●  We feel that these definitions are adequate and no other terms need to be defined.  19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. We could define the term to mean, for example:  any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or  any potential cybersecurity threat. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful?  Why or why not? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is  there another definition that would better define cybersecurity?  ●  Yes, defining cybersecurity will be extremely helpful because currently the term is used loosely  and has many different meanings or interpretations. We require a common definition.  ●  The proposal for the definition of cybersecurity, uses the word cybersecurity in the definition  multiple times. Please consider:  ○  Any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any threat or  incident of an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information  systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants  information systems or any information residing therein.  File Number S7 09 22 | Blue Lava Response to Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Page 1  20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or  other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service  provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors?  ●  We believe that requiring the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant,  auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external  third party service provider should be included. However, there are potential issues with public  disclosure. For example  listing providers could mean that the provider becomes a target.  ●  We believe forcing transparency here would enable the market to develop a perspective on  credibility and efficacy based on how often theyre seeing a certain provider, and whether certain  providers tend to often be associated with breaches. It could also make it more acceptable for  companies to specify specific vendors associated with their breaches if theyre already disclosing  who they work with for solutions.  21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not  have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it  has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures?  ●  Yes, any public entity should state whether they have or do not have:  ○  Policies  ○  Standards  ○  A cybersecurity program that measures, manages, and communicates effectiveness  ○  The state of their cybersecurity program  ●  The governance of a cybersecurity program must be visible and reported to Executive Staff team  members and the Board of Directors.  ●  The governance of a cybersecurity program must include an appointed executive or senior  personnel responsible for cybersecurity.  ●  Policies, standards, and a cybersecurity program are useless if no one is accountable for their  enforcement.  32. Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual report and proxy or information  statement, as proposed?  ●  We believe the disclosure of a person with cybersecurity experience that works with the Board  should be required. It is our opinion that it will be difficult to have a trained and qualified  cybersecurity expert on every public Board. An alternative approach is to ensure th Board has  access to a cybersecurity expert to work directly with the Board.  41. What are the economic effects of the proposed cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity risk  management, strategy, and governance disclosures? Would those disclosures provide informational  benefits to investors? Would registrants benefit from a potential decrease in cost of capital because of the  enhanced disclosure? Are there any other benefits, costs, and indirect effects of the proposed disclosure  that we should also consider?  ●  Disclosures will sharpen corporate focus on proactively improving their cybersecurity risk  management, strategy and governance, therefore reducing business risk and expected loss  exposures. These strong cybersecurity program management investments will increase  shareholder value in the long term because they will be aligned and measured against business  File Number S7 09 22 | Blue Lava Response to Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Page 2  objectives. As organizations work through digital transformation and adopting emerging  technologies, cybersecurity will become an enabler to the business. Organizations must shift  away from having the basics in their cybersecurity program to a holistic program that aligns to the  business.  43. Would both types of the proposed disclosure, cybersecurity incident disclosure and cybersecurity risk  management, strategy, and governance disclosure, increase the vulnerability of registrants to  cybersecurity incidents? Would this effect be mitigated by any of the other effects of the proposal,  including indirect effects such as registrants potential strengthening of cybersecurity risk management  measures? What would be the impact of the proposed disclosure on the likelihood of future incidents for  registrants? Would that impact be the same for both types of disclosure?  ●  Public disclosure in any form would certainly make a company a further target. Consider requiring  companies to perform certain functions  potentially securing and closing any related gaps before  disclosing. This approach could allow for the required time it may take to identify and address an  issue and will influence organizations to increase the effectiveness of their cybersecurity program.  44. Would the proposed incident disclosure increase registrants compliance costs to fulfill the proposed  disclosure requirements related to incident reporting? What would be the magnitude of those costs?  Would the proposed cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure lead to indirect  costs such as hiring a board member or staff to their management team with cybersecurity expertise, or  costs to devise, implement or improve the processes and procedures related to cybersecurity?  ●  There will be incremental costs associated with new disclosure and compliance requirements;  however history has proven time and time again that the subsequent reductions in expected loss  exposure(s) greatly outweigh the costs of those investments. It is our belief and experience that  the benefits greatly outweigh the costs. That is the fundamental tenet and value of risk  management and public transparency  a companys cybersecurity program will become more  effective and efficient.  46. Are there any specific data points that would be valuable for assessing the economic effects of the  proposed cybersecurity incident and risk management, strategy, and governance that we should consider  in the baseline analysis or the analysis of the economic effects? If so, please provide that data.  ●  Reports and analysis such as the Verizon Data Breach and Investigation Report (DBIR) provide  good insights into the nature and impacts of cybersecurity incidents, and can be used to quantify  the frequency and impact of cybersecurity risks.  49. Would any of the proposed amendments have disproportionate costs for smaller reporting  companies? Do smaller reporting companies face a different set of cybersecurity risks than other  companies?  ●  Yes, it is likely that the costs of complying with these new rules will be higher for smaller  companies relative to their overall budgets. It is one of the reasons why the larger a company  gets, the more it is able to invest in its cybersecurity and risk management programs. This can be  potentially offset however by the use of effective and affordable cybersecurity program  management tools, cybersecurity risk management tools and common approaches to reporting  on cybersecurity.  File Number S7 09 22 | Blue Lava Response to Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Page 3  ●  The risk exposure for smaller companies is generally smaller, given expected loss exposures  correlate with the revenues at risk, volume of customer records, etc. However the risks  themselves would be similar.  50. Are there any other alternative approaches to improve disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents,  cybersecurity risk management, strategy, or governance that we should consider? If so, what are they  and what would be the associated costs or benefits of these alternative approaches?  ●  The industry has historically been focusing on compliance frameworks, not cybersecurity program  management. Compliance and cybersecurity are not the same thing. A cybersecurity centric  framework and methodology would yield much more tangible and consistent insights.  ●  The current reporting at the Board level is usually through the lens of an industry framework,  which is missing some elements necessary to a holistic view of a cybersecurity program specifically: Fraud, Account Takeover, Cloud Security, and Application Security.  ●  Finally, there is no common language or taxonomy to support the ability to communicate or report  on cybersecurity efforts consistently. A cybersecurity centric framework would help address that.  File Number S7 09 22 | Blue Lava Response to Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Page 4",2

We share the goal of ensuring fair disclosure to investors. However, the Commission must balance competing important interests. It must balance the desire to provide prompt public disclosure to assist investors with the important interest in ensuring that disclosures contain useful information rather than being issued too soon, while too much information may still be unknown. Separately,    1 USTelecom is the premier trade association representing service providers and suppliers for the telecom industry. Its diverse member base ranges from large publicly traded communications corporations to small companies and cooperatives—all providing advanced communications services to both urban and rural markets.  2 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File No. S7 09 22 (rel. Mar. 9, 2022) (Proposed Rules). 2  the Commission must strike a balance between the interest in disclosure and the benefit that keeping an incident confidential may provide to investigation and resolution of the incident. The Commission should also streamline any rules it may adopt with existing federal and state requirements in this space. USTelecoms long of history of collaboration with U.S. government partners informs our comments in these proceedings. USTelecom presently chairs the Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC), which is among the principal organizations serving as the governments industry partners for developing cybersecurity policies that affect the internet ecosystem. USTelecom founded, and presently co leads with the Consumer Technology Association, the Council to Secure the Digital Economy (CSDE), a group of fifteen large international ICT companies dedicated to preserving the security of our communications infrastructure and connected digital ecosystem.3 CSDE is recognized by the U.S. government as a leading industry partnership in coordinating efforts to combat botnets, respond to cyber crises, and promote cybersecurity through development of best practices. As our leadership in these efforts makes clear, USTelecom fully recognizes the significant cybersecurity challenges facing our nations infrastructure and broader stakeholder community. USTelecom is committed to finding proactive solutions that help the U.S. government achieve its goals and offers these comments in the spirit of partnership and collaboration.    3 CSDE, https://csde.org.  3  I. THE REPORTING WINDOW SHOULD ACCOMMODATE LAW ENFORCEMENT, STATE LAWS, AND COMPANIES EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION The Commission proposes a public reporting window of only four business days.4 While USTelecom supports a reporting requirement in principle, an inflexible four business day disclosure requirement is not appropriate. Providers might not be able to say anything useful in four days and may be able to provide publicly only limited information at that point regarding an evolving situation. Disclosures at that point could cause unnecessary public speculation as to the cause and effect and scope of a given cybersecurity incident. Such speculation could, contrary to the Commissions intent, lead to worse outcomes for investors. Moreover, the negative publicity that may come in the early days of an incident will disproportionately impact companies with more mature cyber programs, who may ultimately be more successful in mitigating the incident. Any reporting window should also take into account state laws or requests from law enforcement to delay reporting when appropriate to enable law enforcement to conduct investigations of cybersecurity events before they become public. The Commissions proposal would potentially disrupt public private partnership relationships with law enforcement, which our industry has cultivated over many decades. Law enforcement efforts are essential to deterring cybercriminals, and doing so ultimately benefits investors across the digital economy. For example, last year, law enforcement disrupted Emotet — referred to as the worlds most dangerous malware by Interpol and Europol — with an international takedown operation.5 Moreover, law enforcement efforts can help companies and investors recover after suffering an attack. For instance, after the Colonial    4 Proposed Rules at Part II (B) (1).  5 CSDE, International Botnet and IoT Security Guide (2022), https://csde.org/wp content/uploads/2022/04/2022 CSDE International Botnet and IOT Security Guide 1.pdf.  4  Pipeline attack, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to successfully claw back a substantial amount of the ransom. A public reporting requirement in the four day timeframe, as opposed to a more flexible timeframe, could jeopardize such efforts. We also note the potential conflict between the Commissions proposed rules and the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) Customer Network Proprietary Information (CPNI) rules, which require carriers to report CPNI breaches to the Secret Service and FBI within seven business days, without publicly disclosing the breaches for seven days after notifying law enforcement.6  II. DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES CREATES CYBERSECURITY RISKS  The Commission notes that, in 2021, most companies that disclosed a cyber incident did not describe their cyber risk management strategies, while others provided only general information rather than in depth descriptions.7 The Commission now proposes Item 106(b) of Regulation S K to require more consistent and detailed disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management and strategy.8 This approach is misguided for two reasons. To begin with, there is an inherent risk in malicious actors having detailed information about cyber risk management strategies. The fact that so many companies declined to disclose more detailed information reflects the reality of this risk.    6 47 CFR § 64.2011 (b) (1). FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel has indicated an interest in initiating a proceeding to update these rules. See FCC Jan. 12, 2022 News Release, https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair rosenworcel circulates new data breach reporting requirements. USTelecom urges this Commission and the FCC, along with other federal agencies, to coordinate efforts and align requirements.  7 Proposed Rules at Part II (D) (1).  8 Id.  5  This approach is also flawed because it adds to a growing list of disclosure about specific risks that may not be material to some companies and could make it seem like certain risks are more important than others. For example, requiring specific disclosures about cyber and climate risk management may signal to the investor that those are more important than other risks (e.g., competition risk). Also, if the SEC continues down this path of requiring disclosure of how specific risks are managed, it runs the risk of causing greater confusion—not greater clarity. As the Commission adds specific items to the list of required governance disclosures depending on the issue de jure, the disclosures will become less clear and easy to understand for investors. A better approach would be to expand the current corporate governance disclosure requirements to require a more detailed description of how boards are informed of risks generally instead of requiring disclosure of specific piecemeal topics.  III. CYBER INCIDENT REPORTING SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS USTelecom urges the Commission to work with partners across the federal government, and also at the state level and with international partners, to avoid conflicting rules and ensure that regulations are minimally burdensome for reporting companies. We note that the recently enacted Cybersecurity Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) calls for the formation of a Cyber Incident Reporting Council, led by the National Cybersecurity Director  and including among its participants the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and sector risk management agencies  to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize Federal incident reporting requirements.9    9 CIRCIA § 2246.  6  In addition to being a full partner in U.S. driven incident reporting initiatives, the Commission should seek, at a minimum, to maintain awareness of international initiatives and incorporate them into its own strategic policymaking  avoiding disharmony to the largest extent possible. The Commission should also engage industry in these discussions. As noted above, not all industries are subject to the same requirements and there is potential for rules to be in direct conflict, even within the United States, which must be avoided at all costs. Finally, we note that reporting information to government partners, while important, requires technical experts to focus on compliance with regulations during or in the immediate aftermath of a cyber incident. Any excess in interpretation or implementation of new rules risks diverting the limited and highly skilled cyber workforce away from operational cybersecurity efforts where they are needed. Again, engaging industry will be essential to ensure the rules are properly streamlined and effective, so as to maximize the resources devoted to mitigating and responding to cyber threats.  IV. A GENERAL REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE BOARD RISK MANAGEMENT BACKGROUNDS IS REASONABLE  FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON CYBER EXPERTISE IS TOO NARROW The Commission proposes to amend Item 407 of Regulation S K, adding the new paragraph (j) requirement: If any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.10 USTelecom would support general reporting about risk management backgrounds, but narrowing in on cybersecurity expertise does not take into account the diverse backgrounds and experiences that will contribute to a successful and diverse board.    10 Proposed Rules at Part II (E) (1).  7  Companies are in the best positions to determine the makeup of the board, whereas the proposed rule incentivizes a cybersecurity check box over putting together the best board, including one that can adequately provide oversight of cyber risk management as well as other important initiatives for the company.  V. CONCLUSION USTelecom appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Commissions proposed rules. We look forward to remaining engaged with the Commission on this matter of significance to our members, the broader cyber ecosystem, and the U.S. economy.

The undersigned are Principals of the Cyber Initiatives Group, a committee formed and sponsored by The Cipher Brief, a private media organization that engages with the private sector in the United States to promote awareness of cybersecurity and national security matters. Many of us currently have direct involvement in cyber matters in the private sector and have significant experience in both policy and operational aspect of cybersecurity; many of us have served at the highest levels of our nations armed forces or intelligence community, while others have leading roles at the nations most significant cybersecurity firms and technology providers. (We are writing in our individual capacities and the affiliations noted below are merely for identification purposes.) Our purpose in submitting these comments is to support the objectives of the Proposed Rule, to advise the Commission that in our opinion national security concerns are a valid and significant rationale for the rulemaking, and to underscore that the Proposed Rule has the potential to benefit not only investors and registrants but also, and in our view more importantly, our national security. In doing so, we are not commenting on the scope, regulatory burden, or other technical aspects of the Proposed Rule  as others can more appropriately address those details. We are, however, in a position to comment on the national security ramifications of a better cybersecurity posture for public companies. As the Commission notes in its Background Statement accompanying the Proposed Rule, [l]arge scale cybersecurity attacks can have systemic effects on the economy as a whole, including serious effects on critical infrastructure and national security.  All of the undersigned are familiar with the technical sophistication of our cyber adversaries and believe that this will continue to increase, imposing greater risks to our nation. In that regard, we note that the Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community (dated February 7, 2022) cited cyber malevolence from four nation state adversaries  China, Russia, Iran and North Korea  as top ranked threats. Unfortunately, as the adversarial threat increases, so too has our vulnerability, as we increasingly rely on digital technology throughout all aspects of our commercial, governmental and personal lives. The advent of the internet of things, and the vast amounts of data that are being generated, stored, and used by 5G telecom technology, artificial intelligence and potentially quantum computing (to name just a few developments), will create additional attractive targets for malicious cyberactivity, thus increasing the risk to our nations infrastructure, businesses and citizens. Much of this technology is owned and operated by public companies. These vulnerabilities can directly affect our national security.  We believe that the goals of requiring current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents, as well as periodic disclosures regarding (1) a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, (2) managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures and (3) the board of directors cybersecurity expertise and its oversight of cybersecurity risk, are appropriate and are likely to enhance the cybersecurity posture of registrants. Public companies own critical infrastructure, operate or manage key businesses in every industrial, agricultural and service sector, and in many respects form the backbone of the American economy. Consequently, improved cybersecurity within public companies translates directly into a national economy that is more cyber secure and cyber resilient. It stands to reason that requiring additional reporting about material cyber incidents will better inform investors, the public generally and governmental agencies, and increased disclosure about cyber policies and board experience will encourage public companies (and by extension, private companies, at least to some degree) to meet if not exceed market expectations in those areas.  By their inherent nature, these benefits cannot be easily quantified, but lack of precise measurement cannot in this case be a reason to deny what is manifestly obvious and logical. We believe that these benefits to our national wellbeing are critical and may and should be taken into account in policy development and rulemaking by the Commission. We understand that interested parties will have different views on the scope and other technical aspects of the Proposed Rule and as noted above, are not expressing an opinion here on those issues. But we do wish to point out that any effort to standardize and harmonize notification and disclosure with other requirements (such as those that will be implemented under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022) will obviously have the effect of increasing robust compliance with, and further the purposes of, the Proposed Rule.

C:OAo.LITION 0  2 As the Commission is aware, the Proposed Rules and other new, federal notification requirements follow a series of cybersecurity attacks in the past two years that have harmed the U.S. public and private sectors.3 With respect to financial institutions, cybersecurity threats and incidents may endanger not only individual banks and their shareholders but also consumers, as well as the stability of U.S. financial markets. 4  For this reason, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has designated the financial services sector a critical infrastructure sector and a vital component of our nations critical infrastructure. 5  As designated by CISA, the sector includes thousands of depository institutions, providers of investment products, insurance companies, other credit and financing organizations, and the providers of the critical financial utilities and services that support these functions, including our members.6 trillion in deposits and extend nearly $11 trillion in loans.  ICBA creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. ICBA is dedicated exclusively to representing the interests of the community banking industry and its membership through effective advocacy, best in class education, and high quality products and services. With nearly 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute roughly 99% of all banks, employ nearly 700,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties. Holding nearly $5.9 trillion in assets, over $4.9 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.5 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation, and fueling their customers dreams in communities throughout America.

Reg. at 16592 (With an increase in the prevalence of cybersecurity incidents, there is an increased risk of the effect of cybersecurity incidents on the economy and registrants. Large scale cybersecurity attacks can have systemic effects on the economy as a whole, including serious effects on critical infrastructure and national security.). 5  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Financial Services Sector, available at https://www.cisa.gov/financial services sector. 6  Id.  3 While cybersecurity threats are a newer challenge for companies in many industries, U.S. banks have long been a target of malicious cyber actors, and accordingly have invested in robust and ever evolving measures to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.  Banks are leaders in the private sector in developing, maintaining, and enhancing cyber defenses.  The industry invests billions of dollars each year in cybersecurity, shares cyber threat intelligence through a pioneering model that has been replicated across industries, and employs thousands of cybersecurity professionals in its efforts to protect not only market participants, but U.S. depositors, including the approximately 95% of U.S. households that maintain a bank account.7  In addition to work within the industry, banks have worked collaboratively with federal law enforcement and regulators for many years in a shared mission to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats and incidents. Since 2002, the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council—a group of financial trade associations, financial utilities, and the nations most critical financial firms—has worked collaboratively with key government agencies with the stated goal of protecting the financial services sector from cyber and physical incidents.  In recent years, as cybersecurity incident reporting requirements have proliferated,8 our members have also worked collaboratively with these agencies to promote harmonization of reporting requirements to achieve an appropriate balance between the benefits of incident reporting and the risks, harms, and operational burdens that may be associated with reporting, particularly during a crisis in which restoring and ensuring the security of services to customers is paramount.  In this regard, the Associations welcome the creation of the Cyber Incident Reporting Council, pursuant to Congresss recent passage of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which will be vested with the authority to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize cyber incident reporting requirements to relieve covered entities of the burden of submitting multiple reports while working to investigate and remediate a significant incident.9  The Associations also welcome the recent establishment of the White House Office of the National  7 See FDIC, How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and Financial Services (Dec. 17, 2021), available at https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household survey/index.html (noting that 94.6 percent of U.S. households (approximately 124.2 million) were ‘banked in 2019, meaning that at least one member of the household had a checking or savings account.).  8  See, e.g., FDIC, Financial Institution Letter: Computer Security Incident Notification Final Rule (Nov. 18, 2021), available at https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial institution letters/2021/fil21074.html; Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, S. 3600, 117th Congress (2022), available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th congress/senate bill/3600/text?r=3&s=1#toc H726F16E30F05452193600342786445B4. 9  See Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, H.R. 5440, 117th Congress (2022), at § 204(b), available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th congress/senate bill/3600/text?r=3&s=1#toc H726F16E30F05452193600342786445B4 (The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director, shall, in consultation with the Cyber Incident Reporting Council … to the maximum extent practicable, periodically review existing regulatory requirements, including the information required in such reports, to report incidents and ensure that any such reporting requirements and procedures avoid conflicting, duplicative, or burdensome requirements.).  4 Cyber Director (ONCD), with the stated mission to ensure federal coherence in cyber policy, action, and doctrine and improve public private collaboration to tackle cyber challenges across sectoral lines.10 Only a partnership and shared commitment between the public and private sectors can effectively mitigate the risk that malicious cyber actors pose to our country.  Consistent with this shared goal, since 2018, the Commission has provided guidance on public company cybersecurity disclosures (2018 Guidance)11 to promote clarity and consistency in reporting, while avoiding reporting requirements that could result in undue harm and security risks to market participants and others. Following the Commissions principles based approach to disclosure requirements, the 2018 Guidance recognizes, for example, that a company may require time to discern the implications of a cybersecurity incident, and states that the Commission does not intend[] to suggest that a company should make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts.12 We appreciate the statement in the preamble to the Proposed Rules that the 2018 Guidance will remain in place following the adoption of any final rules. The Commission posits in the Proposed Rules that the 2018 Guidance is insufficient and that investors would benefit from additional detail and greater uniformity in cybersecurity reporting, but the limited materials cited lend little support for that proposition.13 In fact, the cited materials describe the enhancements and continuing, positive trends in public companies cybersecurity disclosures following the 2018 Guidance, and conclude that the Commissions existing disclosure regime is adequate.14  10  Office of the National Cyber Director, A Strategic Intent Statement for the Office of the National Cyber Director (Oct. 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp content/uploads/2021/10/ONCD Strategic Intent.pdf. 11 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Release No. 33 10459 (Feb. 26, 2018), No. 33 10459 (Feb. 21, 2018) [83 Fed. Reg. 8166 (Feb. 26, 2018)], available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf. See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16594 (The guidance set forth in both the 2011 Staff Guidance and the 2018 Interpretive Release would remain in place if the Commission adopts the proposed rule amendments described in this release.). 12 2018 Guidance at 8169. 13  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16607 ([I]nvestors would benefit [from the Proposed Rules] because: (1) [m]ore informative and timely disclosure would reduce mispricing of securities in the market and facilitate their decision making; and (2) [m]ore uniform and comparable disclosures would lower search costs and information processing costs.). 14 Specifically, the Moodys survey cited by the Commission reviewed registrants disclosures from 2018, the year the 2018 Guidance was issued, and thus provides little, if any, insight into the impact of the guidance. In fact, noting the high quality of banks cybersecurity disclosures, Moodys expressed its view that the 2018 Guidance would, over time, generate more consistent and reliable information across industries. The 2020 EY review cited by the Commission found that many companies are enhancing their cybersecurity disclosures, and noted marked increases since 2018 in disclosures on  5 While the Associations support aspects of the Proposed Rules, we believe change is essential in several areas, including to harmonize the Proposed Rules with the 2018 Guidance. We propose revisions in those areas.  I. Executive Summary • While we support the policy goals of the Proposed Rules, we believe that, as currently drafted, the Proposed Rules insufficiently take into account other policy goals, including ensuring the cybersecurity of registrants; protecting the safety and soundness of financial institutions; and identifying and bringing to justice the perpetrators of serious cybercrimes.  • The Proposed Rules impose requirements for the timing and content of disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K without sufficient regard for the security risks and harms that such disclosures may pose in certain circumstances.  Specifically, the very fact of disclosure that a cybersecurity incident is ongoing and unremediated may adversely impact a registrants ability to effectively respond to and remediate the incident, and significantly exacerbate the resulting risks and harms to the registrant and its shareholders, customers, and others.  o The timing for the required disclosure of a cybersecurity incident on Form 8 K should be changed in the final rule to four business days after the registrant has reasonably determined that the cybersecurity incident is no longer ongoing, and that public disclosure of the incident will not seriously jeopardize the security of the registrant. o Registrants should not be required to disclose to what extent an incident has been remediated given the security risks that such disclosure would pose to them. o The instructions for the Form 8 K disclosure should incorporate the Commissions statement, set forth in the preamble to the Proposed Rules, that registrants are not expected to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity  board oversight of cybersecurity, and cybersecurity risks and risk management. Finally, the 2021 report of the National Associate of Corporate Directors (NACD) specifically concluded that the Commissions current disclosure regulations are adequate[.]. See Moodys Investors Service, Cyber Disclosures Reveal Varying Levels of Transparency Across High Risk Sectors (Oct. 2, 2019), available at https://journalofcyberpolicy.com/ wp content/uploads /2019/10/Moodys Cyber disclosures 10.19.pdf; EY, What Companies Are Disclosing About Cybersecurity Risk and Oversight in 2020 (Aug. 10, 2020), available at https://www.ey.com/ en_us/board matters/what companies are disclosing about cybersecurity risk and oversight; See SecurityScorecard, National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), Cyber Threat Alliance, HIS Markit, and Diligent, The State of Cyber Risk Disclosures of Public Companies (March 2021), available at https://www.nacdonline.org/insights/publications.cfm?ItemNumber=71711.  6 systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident. o The final rule should allow registrants to furnish, rather than require them to file, the required Form 8 K given the short time frame for filing and difficult judgments that registrants may be required to make with respect to the scope and implications of the relevant cybersecurity incident. o The final rule should allow for delayed disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident, for an appropriately limited period of time, (1) at the request of a United States Attorney, the Attorney General, or such individuals as may be authorized by the Attorney General, on the ground that disclosure would compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation; (2) at the request of CISA, on the ground that disclosure would compromise an ongoing effort to disseminate threat information to, or otherwise protect, critical infrastructure; or (3) by a financial institution, at the request of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or the OCC, on the ground that disclosure may compromise the safety or soundness of a financial institution or the financial system. • With respect to periodic disclosures, registrants should not be required to disclose the nature or status of remediation activities, including changes to cybersecurity policies and procedures. Such disclosure would assist threat actors seeking to identify ways to compromise the registrants information systems, while providing little or no useful information to market participants. • Certain definitions set forth in the Proposed Rules, including cybersecurity incident and information systems, are overbroad and should be clarified in order to be workable. Specifically:  o The definition of cybersecurity incident is overbroad in requiring disclosure of any incident that merely jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. This definition will pressure registrants to disclose incidents that merely have the potential to become material, notwithstanding the stated materiality threshold, including incidents that are ultimately determined to cause no actual harm or impact, resulting in inaccurate disclosures and unnecessary confusion. The word jeopardizes should be replaced with results in substantial loss of to capture incidents that are causing some actual harm, and to better harmonize the definition with the reporting standard set forth by Congress in CIRCIA.15  15  See Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, § 2242(c)(2)(i) (A clear description of the types of substantial cyber incidents that constitute covered cyber incidents, which shall, at a minimum, require the occurrence of a cyber incident that leads to substantial  7 o The definition of information systems should be amended to exclude reference to physical infrastructure or otherwise clarify that it includes only physical infrastructure used for the transmission or storage of electronic data.  o The final rule should clarify the scope of incidents to be reported.  Specifically, as drafted, the Proposed Rules require disclosure of unauthorized incidents, but the examples provided in the Proposed Rules of incidents that would need to be disclosed if material include authorized incidents with unintended consequences, such as a deliberate action by a registrant that unintentionally results in the disclosure of data.16 • The Commission should clarify the scope of the requirement to disclose incidents that may be considered material in the aggregate, including a list of non exhaustive examples for reference. Unlike in the accounting and auditing contexts, registrants information systems, network architecture, controls, policies, and procedures are dynamic, rendering comparisons between incidents difficult to make, and the nature, source, and root cause of any actual or potential cybersecurity incident may be equally difficult to assess in relation to that of prior incidents. • The final rule should include less detailed and prescriptive requirements with respect to disclosure of registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures, as such disclosures may pose a security risk to registrants.  • Registrants should not be required to disclose details related to a registrants selection and oversight of third party entities, including the mechanisms, controls, and contractual requirements leveraged to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Rather, registrants should only be required to disclose high level information, including confirmation that policies and procedures are appropriately applied to third party selection and ongoing oversight. • Finally, the Associations do not support a new requirement that registrants disclose the cybersecurity expertise of members of a board of directors. The proposed requirement will have the effect of suggesting that boards without directors with such specific expertise are somehow deficient. Pressure from the SEC for public companies to designate directors with expertise in any single area may adversely impact their ability to identify and appoint directors with other experience, expertise, or capabilities they believe are appropriate for the oversight of the particular risks and opportunities the institution encounters, and may not result in more effective cyber risk oversight for the institution. Moreover, current disclosures provide investors with sufficient information as to the experience of  loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information system or network, or a serious impact on the safety and resiliency of operational systems and processes[.]) (emphasis added). 16  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16596.  8 members of the board of directors. If the Commission nonetheless believes more information is required, registrants could be required to disclose how the board of directors oversees the cybersecurity risks the company faces (e.g., leveraging existing board committees).  II. Discussion of Comments on the Proposed Rules A. Disclosure of Ongoing, Unremediated Cybersecurity Incidents Would Expose Registrants and Others to Serious Risks and Harms The Proposed Rules would add a new Item 1.05 to Form 8 K that would require disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident within four business days after a registrant determines that it has experienced such an incident. As proposed, Item 1.05 would require disclosure of, to the extent known at the time of the filing:  (i) when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing;  (ii) a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident;  (iii) whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose;  (iv) the effect of the incident on the registrants operations; and (v) whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.17  The Associations appreciate the Commissions request for comment about these proposed disclosure requirements, including whether the proposed disclosures could have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents, and whether specific disclosure items should be modified or eliminated.18 Critically, requiring registrants to disclose ongoing cybersecurity incidents, and whether the incidents have been remediated, would put registrants at risk with respect to the very incidents being disclosed. For the banking industry, such disclosure may result in harm to the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the ability of financial institutions to provide core services to consumers and businesses, financial institutions ability to safeguard customers funds and sensitive data, and the stability of the financial system, among other harms.  When a significant cybersecurity incident is ongoing, the very fact of disclosure will alert the threat actors present in the registrants systems that malicious activity has been detected, causing them to engage in actions that will seriously impede the registrants response to, and remediation of, the incident. Specifically, disclosure would be expected to cause the threat actors to speed up their efforts to cause harm, engage in techniques that obfuscate their presence  17  See id. at 16595. 18  See id. at 16597.  9 in the network, and destroy evidence of their criminal conduct. Furthermore, as a result of the disclosure, other malicious actors may seek to take advantage of the ongoing incident to cause harm to the company. In addition, if the incident that is disclosed results from a problem or vulnerability that may be present at other registrants, the disclosure can be expected to result in other malicious actors capitalizing on the information to attempt to compromise others.  By way of example, in the ransomware context, it is not uncommon for a company to identify threat actors in the network engaged in activity preparatory to encryption, including after stealing sensitive or confidential data. In that circumstance, in practice, the company proceeds to purge the threat actors as expeditiously as possible in a manner that prevents them learning that the company is taking steps to expel them. Under the Proposed Rules, however, disclosure may be required while the perpetrators are still in the companys systems. If the threat actors learn the company has identified their presence, there is a significant risk that the threat actors unleash the ransomware immediately, even if they were otherwise still engaged in preparatory activity such as expanding their access to the companys systems to maximize the reach of the ransomware. Upon disclosure of an ongoing incident, the threat actors would also be expected to take immediate steps to destroy logs and other evidence within or regarding the companys systems that enable the company to detect their whereabouts and the nature of their activities. This expected response would not only make it difficult or impossible to identify or apprehend the threat actors, but would pose security risks for the company, providing the threat actors with an opportunity to hide more effectively and thereby maintain a persistent presence in the network that the company is no longer in a position to detect. Thus, in this example, the disclosure of the ongoing incident may result in a ransomware attack on the registrant, an inability to identify or expel the threat actors, and the destruction of critical evidence. Additionally, with respect to financial institutions, disclosure of a significant, ongoing cybersecurity incident may provoke unnecessary confusion among investors and depositors and market volatility as information about an ongoing cyber incident is constantly evolving. This could undercut the Commissions goal of ensuring orderly markets. Financial institutions work closely with bank regulators to manage and mitigate crisis situations to avoid such unnecessary confusion or a deposit run on a bank in which the public has lost confidence.  The federal bank regulators recently promulgated a rule requiring banks to notify their prudential regulator confidentially within 36 hours of certain material cybersecurity incidents in part to help reduce losses in the event a notification incident is so significant that it jeopardizes a banking organizations viability, as the [rule provides] additional time for the agencies to prepare to handle a potential failure as cost effectively and non disruptively as possible. 19 A requirement to publicly disclose significant, ongoing cybersecurity incidents undermines that goal, increasing the likelihood of a more disruptive, disorderly incident in which neither the bank nor its regulators can answer depositors questions or provide sufficient reassurance that the issue is being effectively addressed. This risk would be even more pronounced to the extent a cybersecurity incident affected multiple financial institutions at the same time. In addition, a panicked or misinformed  19  Computer Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank Service Providers, 86 Fed. Reg. 2299, 2304 (Jan. 12, 2021) (to be codified at C.F.R. pt. 53, 225, and 304).  10 reaction from consumers will divert the attention of bank leadership in the critical moments of a crisis. Apart from whether the incident is ongoing, proposed Item 106 would require disclosure of [w]hether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.20  While the Associations appreciate that the Proposed Rules would not require a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response,21 the mere fact of a public disclosure that an incident is or is not yet remediated increases the risk of harm to the registrant and others in connection with the incident at issue. For instance, if malicious actors are alerted to the fact that a registrant in a particular industry has been unable to remediate in a timely fashion, and is thus unable to effectively disable a particular exploit, they or other malicious actors may leverage that information to target other registrants with the same exploit. Conversely, there may be occasions where a registrant believes, in good faith, that an incident has been effectively remediated, but the malicious actor has maintained a backdoor into the registrants network that it is waiting to exploit. A disclosure that an incident has been remediated may prompt the malicious actor to move quickly back into the network to capitalize on the registrants misunderstanding before the registrant can identify that an issue has persisted. The Associations appreciate that the Commission has acknowledged that disclosing significant, ongoing cybersecurity incidents poses a risk of harm to registrants.22 While set forth as a cost, the Proposed Rules do not explain why the Commission believes this cost is outweighed by the perceived benefit of public disclosure of an ongoing cybersecurity incident.  Our members, including cybersecurity experts and professionals who manage their cybersecurity risk, believe the benefit is significantly outweighed by the risk of harm that disclosure would pose, as set forth above. Furthermore, these harms would not be limited to the registrant at issue and its investors, but would be faced by consumers, whose deposits and sensitive data may be at risk if the cybersecurity of banks is compromised, as well as other registrants who may be attacked by malicious actors seeking to take advantage of any broader or systemic vulnerabilities or weaknesses suggested by the disclosure.23  For these reasons, we believe registrants should not be required to disclose cybersecurity incidents that are ongoing, or to disclose whether an incident has been remediated.  We propose that the requisite disclosure on Form 8 K be modified in the final rule to four business  20  See id. 21  See id. 22  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16610 (Malicious actors could engage in further attacks based on the information [required to be disclosed], especially given that registrants would also need to make timely disclosure, which could mean that the underlying security issues might not have been completely resolved, thereby potentially exacerbating the ongoing attack.  As a result, the proposed incident disclosure rules could potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants, imposing a cost on them and their investors.). 23  As noted above, such disclosure may not only result in harm to the safety and soundness of the bank, but also to customers more generally, as the banks ability to safeguard customers data and funds may be compromised.  11 days after the registrant has reasonably determined that the cybersecurity incident is no longer ongoing, and that public disclosure of the incident will not seriously jeopardize the security of the registrant. We believe this disclosure requirement appropriately balances the goals of the Proposed Rules with the goals of avoiding potential harm to registrants security, and the safety and soundness of financial institutions.  We believe our proposal has the additional benefit of reducing the likelihood that registrants will need to correct 8 K disclosures made while a cybersecurity incident is ongoing, a significant concern based on the Proposed Rules as drafted. When an incident is ongoing, it is common for registrants understanding of the important facts to be unclear or evolving, including as to the nature, scope, and impact of the incident, a fact essentially recognized by the 2018 Guidance but which the Proposed Rules would require registrants to disclose.24 In requiring disclosure in this circumstance, the Proposed Rules may lead to registrants unintentionally disclosing information that is subsequently determined to be incorrect because, by definition, the nature, scope, and impact of an incident, and the extent of containment and remediation of the incident, may be changing while the attack is ongoing. At the same time, while the attack is ongoing, the registrant may not have had any meaningful opportunity to investigate and determine the accuracy of available facts.  As the Commission is aware, the mere fact of having to correct information provided in the initial Form 8 K may cause confusion and uncertainty for investors, and lead to litigation, civil liability and reputational harm for the registrant. This problem has been well documented, resulting in criticism of registrants in follow on litigation, for example, for failing to state facts accurately in initial public disclosures, whether the registrants report ultimately turns out to be too negative or too positive.25 Notably, while the Proposed Rules would provide a limited safe harbor from liability under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b 5 under the Securities Exchange Act,  24  See 2018 Guidance at 8169. 25  See, e.g., Amended Consol. Class Action Compl. ¶ 391, In re Blackbaud, Inc. Customer Data Security Breach Litig., No. 3:20 mn 02972 JMC (D. S.C. Feb. 3, 2022), ECF No. 77 (allegation by class action plaintiffs that Blackbaud failed to provide Plaintiffs and Class Members with timely and adequate notice of the extent of the Data Breach by falsely assuring them in its public statements and Notices issued prior to September 29, 2020, that the attack only impacted certain Private Information and specifically did not include SSNs when the companys subsequent disclosures provided different information); Amended Consol. Class Action Compl. ¶ 140, In re Equifax, Inc. Securities Litig., No. 1:17 cv 03463 TWT (N.D. Ga. Apr. 23, 2018), ECF No. 49 (allegation by class action plaintiffs that [i]n the days that followed Equifaxs initial disclosure of the Data Breach, new information was revealed that continue to inform the market not only of the gravity of the breach, but of the fundamental defects in the Companys data security framework that enabled the breach to occur in the first place and to go undetected for so long, and of how significant the steps to remediation would really be); Consumer Plaintiffs First Amended Consolidated Class Action Compl. ¶ 110, In re Target Corp.

Relatedly, we request that the instructions for the Form 8 K disclosure incorporate the Commissions statement, set forth in the preamble to the Proposed Rules, that it would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident.26  Finally, the Associations appreciate the Commissions request for comment as to whether registrants should be permitted to furnish rather than be required to file the required Form 8 K. We believe it is important that registrants be permitted to furnish the Form 8 K in light of the short time frame for filing, and the difficult judgments registrants may be required to make with respect to the nature, scope, and implications of the relevant cybersecurity incident. As the Commission properly acknowledges, it may take a considerable amount of time even under the best of circumstances to determine the exact nature, scope, and implications of a cybersecurity incident, and neither the registrant nor the authorized person executing the Form 8 K should have liability for disclosure judgments made in such difficult circumstances.  B. The Final Rules Should Provide a Safe Harbor for Delayed Disclosure in Limited Circumstances at the Request of Federal Bank Regulators, Federal Law Enforcement, or CISA  The Associations appreciate that the Commission has requested input on whether any rule [should] provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security[.]27 The Associations believe this potential exception should be broadened to allow delayed disclosure (1) at the request of a United States Attorney, the Attorney General, or such individuals as may be authorized by the Attorney General, on the ground that disclosure would compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation; (2) at the request of CISA, on the ground that disclosure would compromise an ongoing effort to disseminate threat information to, or otherwise protect, critical infrastructure; or (3) by a financial institution, at the request of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or the OCC on the ground that disclosure may compromise the safety or soundness of a financial institution or the financial system. An appropriately limited delay in disclosure in order not to compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation can significantly aid registrants in responding to and remediating a cybersecurity incident. Such appropriately limited delays may enable law enforcement to gather and then share critical evidence to enable registrants to identify compromises before malicious actors can take steps to cause harm or obscure their presence. For example, law enforcement may (and often does) share known IP addresses used by the malicious actors to enable registrants to determine if any additional malicious connections to the companys network are occurring that  26  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16595. 27  See id. at 16598.  13 would not otherwise be discernible; email addresses used by malicious actors to send spear phishing emails, in order to enable the registrant to identify personnel, accounts, devices, or other infrastructure that are being targeted by malicious actors; and domains used by the malicious actors in order to enable the registrant to search the companys records to see if the domains were visited.  If a disclosure on Form 8 K was made as proposed, however, malicious actors would be expected to take steps to hide their presence, including by using different tools and infrastructure that law enforcement and registrants will no longer be able to identify.  An appropriately limited delay in disclosure may also enable law enforcement to act quickly to identify and apprehend perpetrators of cybercrimes using evidence that the perpetrators would be expected to destroy if the incident were publicly disclosed. Given that most threat actors engage in cybercrime repeatedly (either as a part of a criminal enterprise or nation state sponsored group), enabling law enforcement to identify and apprehend them is critical to expanding the breadth and depth of the protection afforded to registrants and market participants and to deterring others from engaging in cybercrime. This is particularly important for registrants in critical infrastructure sectors, including the financial services sector. Separately, we believe the Proposed Rules should provide for delayed disclosure at the request of CISA in limited circumstances to support CISAs critical responsibility to coordinate[] the execution of our national cyber defense, lead[] asset response for significant cyber incidents and ensure[] that timely and actionable information is shared across federal and non federal and private sector partners. 28  Pursuant to the recently passed Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022, covered entities will be required to confidentially report a broad range of cybersecurity incidents to CISA within 72 hours 29 in part so CISA can, as appropriate, rapidly disseminate to appropriate stakeholders actionable, anonymized cyber threat indicators and defensive measures.30 Under the Proposed Rules, however, an 8 K filing could be required within 24 hours of a required, confidential notification to CISA, undermining CISAs ability to coordinate and disseminate threat indicators and defensive measures in time for others to act on the information. Companies throughout the private sector could be harmed, since the 8 K disclosure will be useful to the threat actors (as set forth above) while being of little or no use to other companies, which may not yet have received the anonymized threat indicators and defensive measures that the Act is intended to enable CISA to provide. 28  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, About CISA, available at https://www.cisa.gov/about cisa. 29  Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, § 2242(a)(1)(A) (A covered entity that experiences a covered cyber incident shall report the covered cyber incident to the Agency not later than 72 hours after the covered entity reasonably believes that the covered cyber incident has occurred.). 30  See id. at § 2245(a)(2)(A); see also Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, Sharing Cyber Event Information: Observe, Act, Report Fact Sheet (April 2022), available at https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Sharing_Cyber_Event _Information_Fact_Sheet_FINAL_v4.pdf (When cyber incidents are reported quickly, CISA can use this information to render assistance and provide a warning to prevent other organizations and entities from falling victim to a similar attack.).  14 With respect to the bank regulators, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC are primarily responsible for overseeing and assuring the safety and soundness of the financial system, a core component of U.S. critical infrastructure. Financial institutions, including the Associations members, work closely with these regulators to manage and mitigate potential crisis situations which may have adverse implications not only for financial institutions, but for depositors and investors, as explained above. Accordingly, we believe the final rule should provide that a financial institution may delay disclosure at the request of the federal bank regulators on the ground that disclosure may compromise the safety or soundness of the financial institution or the financial system. The final rule could limit the period or circumstances of the permissible delay as the Commission and bank regulators deem appropriate. Against this backdrop, the Commissions proposed exception is overly narrow and unworkable both in substance and timing. Many serious cybercrimes with the potential to affect multiple registrants and other market participants are not matters of U.S. national security. And with respect to timing, even cybercrimes that implicate national security may not be identifiable as such within four days, much less also, within that time, escalated to the highest level of the Justice Department and the subject of a written nondisclosure request from the Attorney General.  Separately, certain cybercrimes may be recognizable to federal bank regulators as potentially affecting the safety and soundness of a financial institution or the financial system, an area in which they have unique expertise, but may not be immediately recognizable to law enforcement as a matter of U.S. national security. Simply put, a broader exception is needed, and our proposal is intended to strike a balance between that need and the policy goals of the Proposed Rules. The lack of an exception in the Proposed Rules is also inconsistent with existing laws across the United States, at the federal and state levels, that authorize delayed disclosure at the request of law enforcement to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation. As reporting requirements have proliferated, legislators and regulators have uniformly provided either that reporting on cyber incidents will be protected from public disclosure (as in the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022) or they have included safe harbors that authorize delayed disclosure to the public at the request of law enforcement. All 50 states have passed laws authorizing delayed disclosure to consumers of breaches of their sensitive personal data at the request of law enforcement to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation; the Gramm Leach Bliley Act similarly authorizes such delayed disclosure by financial institutions;31 and federal law enforcement agencies make such requests of registrants in appropriate circumstances.32 Without  31  See 12 C.F.R. App. B to Part 30(III)(A) (Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay.  However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation.). 32  Cf. 45 C.F.R. § 164.412 (If a law enforcement official states to a covered entity or business associate that a notification, notice, or posting required under this subpart would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, a covered entity or business associate shall: (a) If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting for the time period specified by the official; or (b) If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identity of the official making the statement, and delay the notification,  15 a corresponding law enforcement exception, the Proposed Rules would undermine the determination of all U.S. states and numerous federal agencies that law enforcements need to protect the public weighs in favor of a disclosure delay in limited circumstances. In that respect, the Proposed Rules would also be in conflict with the mission of the ONCD.33 Thus, while the Proposed Rules serve an important purpose, we believe a limited safe harbor is critical to the protection of registrants, market participants, and our shared commitment to enhancing the nations ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cybercrime, as well as to the governments stated mission of ensuring coherence and promoting the public private partnership in cybersecurity.34  C. The Final Rules Should Not Require Registrants to Disclose the Nature of Remedial Efforts  Proposed new Item 106 of Regulation S K would require updated disclosure in Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Annual Reports on Form 10 K of material changes, additions, or updates to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents including, in relevant part, [a]ny changes in the registrants policies and procedures resulting from the cybersecurity incident, and how the incident may have informed such changes.35 notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described in paragraph (a) of this section is submitted during that time.).  33  White House, Office of the National Cyber Director, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/ (describing its mission of ensuring federal coherence and improving public private collaboration in cybersecurity). 34  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14028, § 1 (May 12, 2021), available at https://public inspection.federalregister.gov/2021 10460.pdf (But cybersecurity requires more than government action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector.); Office of the National Cyber Director, A Strategic Intent Statement for the Office of the National Cyber Director (Oct. 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp content/uploads/2021/10/ONCD Strategic Intent.pdf (Taken together, and in partnership with the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, fellow White House offices, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its partner Sector Risk Management Agencies, government stakeholders at every level, and, of course, the private sector, these efforts will improve our ability to collaborate, take Americans off the front lines of cyber conflict, and improve our national and economic security.). 35  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 16598 (listing non exclusive examples of the type of disclosure that should be provided, if applicable, including: (i) any material impact of the incident on the registrants operations and financial condition; (ii) any potential material future impacts on the registrants operations and financial condition; (iii) whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident; and (iv) any changes in the registrants policies and procedures as a result of the cybersecurity incident, and how the incident may have informed such changes).  16 Financial institutions employ multi layered and changing defenses to ensure their cybersecurity. Their policies and procedures in this regard are highly sensitive and confidential, and are closely held even within the organization because disclosure of them or any part of them may jeopardize the companys security. Requiring registrants to disclose changes in their cybersecurity policies and defense procedures would assist malicious actors looking for ways to compromise them, while providing virtually no benefit to investors, who are ill equipped to assess the nature and significance of the changes, particularly without an understanding of the registrants unique and complex information systems, infrastructure, and technology.  The Associations appreciate the Commissions recognition that the detailed disclosures required by the Proposed Rules on this sensitive subject may increase the risk of future cyberattacks on registrants.36 The Associations do not agree, however, that the concern should be discounted due to the fact that academic research so far has not provided evidence that more detailed cybersecurity risk disclosures would necessarily lead to more attacks.37 The limited studies cited by the Commission did not assess the impact of disclosing the nature and status of remedial efforts to address cybersecurity incidents, including changes to policies and procedures, which we believe registrants generally do not provide given the sensitivity of the information. Nor did the studies consider the views of information security professionals, law enforcement, or other experts on the impact such disclosures would be expected to have on registrants and others. And while the Proposed Rules focus on the potential that these disclosures may increase the risk of future cyberattacks, they fail to acknowledge the detrimental impact such disclosure may have with respect to the very incident the registrant is working to remediate. A registrant disclosing to the public that it has not yet been able to remediate a material incident, and thus remains vulnerable in a particular regard, may enable cybercriminals to target and frustrate the registrants remedial efforts.  The Commission also suggests that these disclosures will enable investors to determine which [registrants] have weak policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risk management,38 but the nature and status of remediation may (and frequently does) reflect not the quality of the remediation or preexisting policies and procedures, but the nature of the relevant incident and the companys information systems, infrastructure, and technology. For example, certain incidents may take weeks or months to remediate, not because the registrant has inadequate procedures or insufficiently prioritizes cybersecurity, but because the remediation requires complex measures that affect interrelated systems and procedures and cannot proceed more quickly without introducing even greater risks or harms. Similarly, particular changes, or a lack of changes, to policies and procedures following an incident may not correlate with the quality of the registrants cyber risk management, and as noted above, the very disclosure of these changes may impair that function. 36  See, e.g., id. at 16610 (The concern is that malicious actors could use the disclosures to potentially gain insights into a registrants practices on cybersecurity issues and thus better calibrate future attacks.).  37  See id. at 16610. 38  See id.  17 The Commission further suggests that the detailed disclosures required by the Proposed Rules will benefit critical infrastructure providers by ensuring that threat information is promptly disseminated to them. In fact, CISA already has responsibility for collecting and disseminating such information, and it does so in a confidential manner, with detailed and actionable information that is critical to registrants ability to take preventative and responsive measures. Members of critical infrastructure industries also already routinely share detailed and actionable threat intelligence with each other. For example, the Associations include founding members of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the global, cyber threat intelligence sharing community focused on the financial services sector that has become a model for cyber information sharing for industries worldwide. As with the information shared by CISA, what is crucial for registrants in these information sharing channels is the dissemination of specific, technical, and confidential information that they can act upon, none of which the disclosures under the Proposed Rules would provide. Similarly, the Commission suggests that the Proposed Rules may benefit consumers, who can use the disclosures to decide how well a registrant protects their sensitive personal information. In fact, premature disclosure of a cybersecurity incident will result in confusion and frustration among consumers whose essential questions—whether and to what extent their own personal information was impacted—are often unanswerable so soon after the incident is discovered. For this reason, data breach disclosure laws in every state provide companies with a reasonable amount of time, which varies by state, in which to identify and notify impacted individuals. By contrast, disclosures under the Proposed Rules may result in a deluge of incoming questions from consumers that cannot be answered, which is unhelpful and even harmful to consumers, would cause reputational harm to the registrant, and will divert managements attention from the crucial task of recovery from a significant incident. Finally, the Proposed Rules would require quarterly or annual disclosure of any material changes, additions, or updates to the information required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 1.05 of Form 8 K.39 The Associations understanding of this proposed requirement is that after a cybersecurity incident ceases to be material, such updated disclosures will no longer be required. D. The Definitions of Cybersecurity Incident and Information Systems Require Clarification The Proposed Rules would require current and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity incidents.40 A cybersecurity incident would be defined as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.41 The Proposed Rules further define information systems as information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing,  39  See id. at 16598. 40  See id. at 16595. 41  See id. at 16601.  18 maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations.42 The Associations appreciate that the Commission sought generally to align the Proposed Rules definitions with existing definitions.43 The Associations also appreciate that the Commission has requested comment as to whether these definitions should be modified, including whether registrants would be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them.44 The Associations believe certain revisions to the proposed definitions are necessary. First, as currently drafted, the definition of cybersecurity incident is overbroad in that it includes any unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Cyber incidents of all kinds may jeopardize a portion of a system or some information within it, but in practice, soon be determined to not to cause any harm. But a disclosure requirement that forces registrants to disclose all incidents that could have significant effect—essentially, a requirement to predict at the outset of an incident whether the incident will cause significant harm—will result in disclosure of incidents as material (because they involve some risk of such harm) that are soon determined to be immaterial (because they do not involve any such harm). In other words, by including the concept of jeopardy, or potential harm, the definition will result in over disclosure of incidents or potential incidents that are subsequently determined not to be harmful, much less materially harmful. These inadvertently inaccurate disclosures may result in mispricing of the companys securities, lawsuits, and reputational harm. To avoid this result, the final rule should replace jeopardizes with results in substantial loss of, a phrase that also better aligns with the definition set forth by Congress in CIRCIA.45 Separately, by including physical infrastructure in the proposed definition of information systems (i.e., physical . . . infrastructure . . . for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information), the definition may be read to capture infrastructure storing physical documents and records, and thus to result in a definition of cybersecurity incident that includes the destruction of physical documents and records. We do not believe this is the Commissions intent, and would propose either deleting the word physical or clarifying that the Commission is referring only to physical infrastructure for the processing or storage of electronic data.  Regarding the proposed definition of information systems that includes systems that are merely used, but not owned, by the registrant, it is important to emphasize that registrants are typically limited in their ability to obtain information from service providers that would enable  42  See id.  43  See id. at 16595, 16600 16601, n.80. 44  See id. at 16598; see also id. at 16601. 45  See Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act, § 2242(c)(2).  19 registrants to make a materiality determination. Certain service providers are required to provide certain breach information to registrants either by regulation or contract, but there is no uniform requirement that applies to service providers. As such, while registrants can make materiality determinations with the information they have, they do not have a unilateral ability to obtain relevant information in all circumstances, particularly with respect to information that resides with third parties. The final rule should reflect this reality, by way of a safe harbor or otherwise.  Finally, the Associations request clarification as to the scope of cybersecurity incidents that would need to be disclosed. While the Proposed Rules refer to unauthorized incidents, they include as an example of an incident that would require disclosure, if material, a situation involving the accidental disclosure of data in connection with an action undertaken by the registrant. In the cybersecurity context, deliberate actions are not typically considered unauthorized, even if they result in unintended consequences. It is unclear whether the Commission intends the rule to capture malicious incidents, as drafted, or even more broadly to include unintentional incidents, such as those caused by outages or technology or other errors.  E. The Requirement to Disclose Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material in the Aggregate Requires Clarification The Proposed Rules would also require registrants to disclose, to the extent known to management, when a series of previously undisclosed cybersecurity incidents that were individually immaterial have become material when viewed in the aggregate. The Associations request clarification of the meaning and scope of this requirement, including by reference to a list of non exhaustive examples. The Associations appreciate that the Commission provided one example of when certain incidents may be considered material in the aggregate,46 but in practice, this requirement may be operationally challenging and overly burdensome to attempt to comply with. For instance, it is unclear how far back in time, what type of information, and in what level of depth registrants would be expected to undertake such a review. In addition, registrants information systems, architecture, policies, and procedures are dynamic, as are the risks they face, which would make it extremely challenging to assess what and how to aggregate, and to compare incidents and the root causes of those incidents. In this regard, cybersecurity is very different from, for example, financial accounting and auditing, which are susceptible to much better defined and uniform standards that relatively rarely change.  Finally, the Associations appreciate the Commissions invitation to comment on whether registrants should have to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q, 10 K, or 8 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material  46  See id. at 16599 (noting that while such incidents conceptually could take a variety of forms, an example would be where one malicious actor engages in a number of smaller but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company and collectively, they are either quantitatively or qualitatively material, or both.).  20 in the aggregate[.] 47 The Associations believe that, if required, such disclosure should be provided on Form 10 K. F. Disclosures Concerning Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures Are Unduly Prescriptive  The Proposed Rules would require registrants to disclose in their Form 10 K policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, including as to operational risk, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers, violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risks, and reputational risks.48 Those proposed disclosures would also include a description of the cybersecurity risk assessment program, including whether it engages assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with its cybersecurity risk assessment program, whether it has policies and procedures used to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with third party service providers (as well as contractual and other mechanisms used to mitigate cybersecurity risks with those providers), whether it undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize the effects of cybersecurity incidents, and whether the company has business continuity, contingency, and recovery plans in the event of a cybersecurity incident.49 The Associations are concerned that these contemplated disclosures are too detailed.  These detailed disclosures called for by the Proposed Rules are problematic for a number of reasons: they place outsized emphasis on one risk facing companies; by prescribing the particular points of cybersecurity policies and procedures, the Commission is effectively signaling how registrants should be managing cybersecurity risks; 50 and they would provide information that is less meaningful to investors but may expose the registrant to security risk by disclosing to malicious actors how the registrant manages its cybersecurity risk. The Associations believe these details are not necessary, and that existing rules regarding disclosure of risk management in connection with Managements Discussion and Analysis should suffice. If the Commission does not view existing rules as sufficient, then disclosures in connection with Managements Discussion and Analysis could be supplemented to include a principles based discussion of cybersecurity risk management and strategy.  47  See id.  48  See id. at 16600. 49  See id.  50  See SEC, Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal (March 9, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922 (Again, while cloaked as a disclosure requirement, the proposed rules pressure companies to consider adapting their existing policies and procedures to conform to the Commissions preferred approach, embodied in eight specific disclosure items. The enumerated disclosure topics likely make sense for many public companies, but securities regulators are not best suited to design cybersecurity programs to be effective for all companies, in all industries, across time.).  21 G. Disclosure Concerning Cybersecurity Considerations With Respect to Third Party Service Providers Should Be Limited to Avoid Exposing Registrants to Security Risks  Under the Proposed Rules, registrants would be required to disclose whether and how cybersecurity concerns affect a registrants selection and oversight of third party entities.51  The Associations believe that disclosure of whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect registrants selection and oversight of third parties should only be provided at a high level, as detailed information may provide a roadmap for malicious actors of vulnerabilities or weaknesses at a registrant or on a more widespread basis among companies. Specifically, disclosure should be limited to confirmation that policies and procedures are appropriately applied to third party selection and ongoing oversight as part of a risk based framework covering the relationship life cycle, and registrants should not be required to include detail as to the mechanisms, controls, and contractual requirements leveraged to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to third party providers.  H. Registrants Should Not Be Required to Disclose and Characterize the Cybersecurity Expertise of Members of the Board of Directors Proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to disclose, in proxy statements and Annual Reports on Form 10 K, whether any member of the board of directors has cybersecurity expertise and, if so, the directors name and details sufficient to fully describe the nature of the expertise.52 Proposed Item 407(j) would not define cybersecurity expertise, but would include the following non exclusive list of criteria to be considered in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity: Whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity, including, for example, prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst, security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident response manager, or business continuity planner; [w]hether the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity; and [w]hether the director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity, including, for example, in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning.53 While the Associations agree that cybersecurity is a significant risk that requires appropriate board oversight, we believe the proposed disclosure requirement is problematic. The proposed requirement will have the effect of suggesting that boards without directors with such specific expertise are somehow deficient, and it comes in the context of other proposed requirements that have the overall effect of encouraging companies to supplant directors with expertise overseeing diverse risks and complex institutions with those who have single subject matter expertise akin to that of senior managers.54 As the Commission is aware, however, the  51  See id. at 16607. 52  See id. at 16601. 53  See id. at 16602. 54  See also The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, 87 Fed. Reg. 21334 (Apr. 11, 2020) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 210, 229,  22 board serves an oversight role, and it is not intended to duplicate or supplant management roles to provide subject matter expertise required to manage day to day operations to achieve the registrants goals.  Boards are, by design, deliberative bodies tasked with oversight of numerous, complex, and inter related risks, of which cybersecurity is one.55 To the extent boards, in their discretion, believe they would benefit from additional expertise and insight, they have long found ways to obtain it, including by consulting with independent experts.56 We believe that a board composed of special interest directors is not the best way to advance the collective oversight of these or any other risks, and that registrants are best equipped to identify board members with the collective experience, knowledge, and judgment to oversee the particular risks they face and select and retain competent management. 232, 239, and 240) (noting, at 21359, that the proposed item would require disclosure of whether any member of a registrants board of directors has expertise in climate related risks[.]). 55  See generally Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR Letter 21 3 / CA 21 1: Supervisory Guidance on Board of Directors Effectiveness (Feb. 26, 2021), available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2103.htm (describing five key attributes of effective boards). 56  See Gregg Rozansky, Bank Policy Institute, 2021 Exposure Draft, Guiding Principles for Enhancing U.S. Banking Organization Corporate Governance (Jan. 12, 2021), available at https://bpi.com/guiding principles for enhancing u s banking organization corporate governance/ (for a discussion regarding board composition and the merits of having a board with a diversity of experiences and perspectives to draw upon). An assessment of the collective capabilities of the board and how the board works together is more meaningful than an assessment of individual skills. Accordingly, boards themselves should make their own determinations on how best to ensure an appropriately knowledgeable perspective on technology related matters for purposes of carrying out their oversight responsibilities—i.e., whether for (i) one or more board member(s) to have particular expertise, (ii) the board to retain external experts for briefings or guidance or education (e.g., for board members to be brought up to date on key developments and, more generally, maintain an appropriately knowledgeable perspective and awareness on technology related issues), and/or (iii) the board to rely on their access to the financial institutions own resources or staff with such expertise, as well as assessments by third parties engaged by management. See OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations and Insured Federal Branches; Integration of Regulations, 79 Fed. Reg. 54517 (Sept. 11, 2014) (codified at 12 C.F.R. pt. 30, 168, 170) (clarifying that the board of directors of a large national bank may rely on risk assessments and reports prepared by independent risk management and internal audit to meet its responsibilities to provide active oversight).  23 Pressuring registrants to designate directors with expertise in any single area may  adversely impact their ability to identify and appoint directors with other attributes they believe are appropriate for the oversight of other risks their particular institution may face. Technical experts may not have other critical experience or capabilities complementing skill needs for the board on a collective basis. As the Commission is undoubtedly aware, there are a limited number of cybersecurity experts, and an even more limited number of such experts with experience in other areas critical to the oversight of public companies. Registrants should have the flexibility to choose whether to appoint single subject matter experts to fill the limited seats on a board, particularly at boards of heavily regulated and complex institutions like the Associations members, which must oversee a range of complex, diverse, and potentially inter related risks.  Some registrants may find that an approach of having a single subject matter expert results in less effective oversight overall as one individual naturally assumes outsize responsibility and authority with respect to a critical risk that is the responsibility of the collective board to oversee.  The proposed requirement is separately problematic because it is not clear that the types of expertise given as examples in the Proposed Rules, including having a cybersecurity certification, are necessary or sufficient for oversight of cybersecurity risk at a complex organization. Moreover, registrants current, required disclosures provide investors with ample information as to the experience of members of the board of directors, so there is no risk that investors are not informed of board members relevant experience. 57  If the Commission nonetheless feels that more information is needed, registrants could be required to disclose how the board of directors oversees the cybersecurity risks the company faces. While we do not believe such a requirement is needed, we believe it would more be useful to investors than the disclosure required by the Proposed Rules and would avoid the potential harms we have identified with the proposed disclosure.  * * * The Associations appreciate the opportunity to comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking. The Associations appreciate the Commissions mission to protect the investors, and we believe our recommendations will not diminish that protection, while better protecting the investor community as a whole and the national interest. The Associations intend to continue jointly discussing the Proposed Rules, and look forward to opportunities to engage in discussion  57  See, e.g., Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, 74 Fed.

If material, this disclosure should cover more than the past five years, including information about the persons particular areas of expertise or other relevant qualifications.).

We appreciate the opportunity to help inform the SECs rule making process.  We support the SECs efforts to strengthen cybersecurity disclosures in response to rapidly evolving marketplace needs. We have drafted this letter to provide some background and context to the Commission regarding the CPA professions efforts in the cybersecurity space, which we believe will provide a common foundation for meaningful cybersecurity risk management and reporting to support decision making by investors and other stakeholders. Overall View  As you know, in todays global markets, new cybersecurity threats loom over all public, private, not for profit, and governmental organizations, regardless of the industries or countries in which they operate.  The World Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2021 recognized that cybercrimes are increasingly sophisticated and frequent, resulting in economic disruption, financial loss, geopolitical tensions and/or social instability. In fact, that report identifies the failure of current cybersecurity measures among risks with the highest likelihood of occurrence within the next ten years. 1 When coupled with unidentified vulnerabilities in new and emerging technologies, cybersecurity risk is top of mind for all organizations.  Investors and other stakeholders need access to timely, transparent, and decision relevant disclosures about matters beyond the financial statements. The SEC recognized investors need for consistent, comparable, and reliable information about an organizations environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts in its recent proposed rules mandating certain climate related financial statement metrics and related disclosures. 2 Similarly, many investors and other stakeholders have also identified the need for comparable, reliable, and decision relevant disclosures about the cybersecurity risks of organizations, and most importantly how organizations identify, assess, and mitigate those risks. 1 World Economic Forum, The Global Risk Report, page 7. 2 SECs proposed rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors (March 2022)  2  As the SEC considers cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting, we think it is essential that all market participants work towards a comprehensive global reporting solution designed to provide investors and other stakeholders with valuable insight into the measures an organization is taking to mitigate risks and respond to cybersecurity incidents.  While it is not possible to guarantee breach prevention, organizations that do not have an effective cybersecurity risk management program in place are at serious risk of being unable to meet their operational, financial, and reporting objectives, to the detriment of both short term and long term value creation potential.  In 2017, the AICPA created the freely available Cybersecurity Risk Management Reporting Framework in recognition of the growing prevalence of cybersecurity risk, and of the related need for commonly accepted, comprehensive standards for effective and transparent cybersecurity risk management and related reporting.  The AICPAs Cybersecurity Risk Management Reporting Framework includes two distinct but complementary sets of criteria that may be used by organizations to help provide robust, decision useful cybersecurity information to a broad range of users: • The AICPAs Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program (Description Criteria) sets forth a list of disclosures intended to provide a description of an organizations cybersecurity risk management program. A description prepared in accordance with the description criteria provides users with information about how an organization identifies its sensitive information and systems, the ways in which the organization identifies and manages cybersecurity risks that threaten it, and a summary of processes implemented and operated to protect the information and systems against those risks. Similar to the SECs proposed disclosures, the Description Criteria are designed to assist companies in reporting tailored, meaningful information that is relevant in light of the nature and circumstances in which they operate. Appendix A to this letter provides a mapping of elements of the Description Criteria to the SECs proposed disclosures, which may serve as a useful reference to the SEC in providing registrants with helpful guidance for preparing cybersecurity disclosures should the proposed rule be implemented. In our view, the Description Criteria can serve as a foundation to help management and boards take a more consistent and comparable approach in establishing a cybersecurity risk management program, and in considering the nature and extent of disclosures that would be necessary for investors to understand how the company addresses cybersecurity risk. That said, since the Description Criteria were designed to meet the potential cybersecurity risk management information needs of a wide variety of stakeholders, a subset of this type of reporting is likely most relevant for investors.  • The AICPAs 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (Trust Services Criteria) are outcome based criteria that can be used to evaluate and report on processes and controls that affect the security, availability, and processing integrity of systems and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by those systems.  Specifically, the Trust Services Criteria covering security, availability, and confidentiality can be used to evaluate and report on an organizations cybersecurity efforts. The Trust Services Criteria are an extension of COSOs Internal Control  Integrated Framework, which is most commonly used to evaluate and report on the effectiveness of a registrants internal control 3  over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The Trust Services Criteria, like COSO, do not require organizations to implement a specific array of controls like many existing process and control frameworks do; rather, they are based on the recognition that organizations need to:  o Identify their operational, reporting and compliance requirements  o Identify the cybersecurity objectives that result from these requirements o Identify the threats to the achievement of the objectives and the vulnerabilities of its operations, functions, and systems to threats  o Assess the likelihood and magnitude of the resultant risks to the objectives o Design, implement and operate controls to mitigate those risks to acceptable levels Both sets of criteria, which are attached to this letter, were developed after careful consideration of the set of information elements best able to meet the cybersecurity information needs of a broad range of users. When developing the criteria, the AICPA: • Considered the process and control requirements identified in existing cybersecurity frameworks3 • Identified best practices for cybersecurity risk management and governance  • Solicited feedback from various key stakeholders, including representatives from the public, private, non profit and government sectors, investor community, boards of directors, registrants, cybersecurity experts, and academics, through a series of focus groups and presentations • Followed due process procedures when exposing both sets of criteria for public comment The AICPA regularly updates the criteria for new and emerging best practices and processes. Specific Areas of Comment Reporting on Material Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K  The AICPA supports the SECs proposed requirements to report cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K. We too believe that information about material cybersecurity incidents is needed to provide timely and relevant disclosure to investors and other stakeholders, such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers, to enable them to assess the possible short and long term financial and operational effects on the registrant. The AICPA believes that material cyber incidents should be reported on a timely basis. We also recognize, however, that cybersecurity incidents vary widely; some are easier to evaluate than others.  Therefore, we  3 Specifically, information from the following standards and frameworks was considered: National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure (NIST Cybersecurity Framework or NIST CSF); ISO/IEC 27001/27002 and related standards; US Dept. of Homeland Security requirements for annual FISMA reporting; FFIEC questionnaires; COBIT; COSOs 2013 Internal Control  Integrated Framework; HIPAA Security Rule; HITRUST CSF; PCI DSS; and NIST Special Publication 800 series  4  believe that registrants are likely to benefit from additional guidance in certain areas, including the following, that may prove to be particularly challenging:  • Consideration of the period of time between incident occurrence, detection, and determination of materiality, given that the length of time between each may vary because of the nature of the incident • Determination of an incidents materiality, including the nature and extent of information needed to make that determination • Consideration of timely reporting, including in situations in which law enforcement authorities have requested that the registrant not disclose a material incident for a period of time • Consideration of how individual immaterial incidents should be aggregated when determining materiality, including the effect of the period over which the incidents take place, the correlation between incidents, and the effect of multiple incidents on cybersecurity risk • Consideration of how incidents that occurred at a service provider should be evaluated as material to the registrant  As noted in Appendix A, the Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program also calls for organizations to make certain disclosures about significant cybersecurity incidents. In addition, the definition of cybersecurity incidents to be disclosed is similar to those included in the SECs proposed disclosures. The AICPA supports the SECs position that, when making those disclosures, registrants must weigh investors need for incident disclosures against the risk of providing those disclosures at such a detailed level that the likelihood of a hostile party exploiting a security vulnerability is increased.4 Disclosures about Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports  The AICPA also supports the proposed requirements to update information about cybersecurity incidents that was previously disclosed in quarterly filings. Disclosures of Registrants Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance over Cybersecurity  As cybersecurity concerns grow, investors, consumers, regulators, public advocacy groups, and other stakeholders are demanding greater transparency about how organizations of all sizes and industries manage their cybersecurity risks. Therefore, the AICPA supports the need for robust and transparent cybersecurity disclosures by registrants.  We also agree with the focus of the proposed disclosures on the registrants risk assessment process, which is critical to establishing an effective cybersecurity risk management program. Without identifying and assessing the unique risks that may prevent a registrant from achieving its cybersecurity objectives, the registrant is unable to design effective policies and procedures to mitigate those risks. In addition, periodic reassessment of risks and control monitoring are necessary elements of an effective cybersecurity program. In addition, we agree that an effective cybersecurity risk management program must address the cybersecurity risks introduced by third parties with whom registrants do business. Therefore, we support the proposed requirement that a registrant be required to disclose the policies and procedures it has designed and  4 AICPA Guide: Reporting on an Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program, paragraph 3.18.  5  implemented to manage cybersecurity risks associated with its use of third party service providers, particularly those policies and procedures it uses to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to those providers.  As noted in Appendix A, the AICPA believes many of the SECs proposed disclosures around risk management, strategy, and governance align with the disclosures covered by the AICPAs Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program.  Disclosures of Cybersecurity Risks and Incidents  The AICPA also supports the Commissions proposed requirements for enhanced disclosures to investors and other stakeholders about organizations cybersecurity risks and incidents. We believe that the proposed disclosures would provide more consistent, comparable, and reliable information for investors and additional clarity for registrants. While we recognize that the definition of materiality included in the proposed disclosures is consistent with the definition of materiality as set forth by the Supreme Court, we believe registrants may benefit from additional guidance on how to determine whether a cyber incident is material for disclosure purposes. In addition, we believe additional clarity is needed for registrants to understand how to aggregate similar and dissimilar incidents when determining whether a material cybersecurity incident has occurred.  Disclosures Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise The AICPA agrees that investors and other stakeholders may benefit from disclosures related to board members cybersecurity expertise.  Understanding such matters enables investors to consider the importance a registrant places in effectively managing its cybersecurity risks. As indicated in Appendix A, the AICPAs Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program also cover disclosure of the process for board oversight of the entitys cybersecurity risk management program.  In some situations, however, board members need not be cybersecurity specialists to oversee an organizations cybersecurity efforts; instead, they need only possess sufficient knowledge and understanding of the cyber risks unique to the organization to meet their oversight responsibilities. Registrants should be free to determine the level of board cybersecurity expertise required and the best manner in which to obtain such expertise. Some boards may be able to leverage the deep cybersecurity expertise of senior executives with the organizations, while others may decide to engage independent cybersecurity experts to provide trust and credibility around the organizations cybersecurity efforts. For some organizations, mandating board member cybersecurity expertise may inhibit recruitment of board members who possess other skills or competencies (for example, ESG) that may be more important to the organization. Such a mandate may also constrain efforts to establish a diverse board of directors who possess a different yet complementary set of skills and competencies necessary to effectively oversee the organization. Other Matters  Need for Globally Accepted Cybersecurity Reporting and Evaluation Standards. In its recent proposed rules for climate related disclosures, the SEC indicated its efforts to align its climate related disclosure framework with existing global standards for climate change disclosures.5 Similarly, the AICPA believes that a broad range  5 SEC Release Nos. 33 11042; 34 94478, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, March 2022.  6  of interested parties, including regulators, investors, analysts, and others, would benefit from the adoption of globally accepted cybersecurity reporting and evaluation standards. The reporting standards could be used by registrants to make consistent and comparable cybersecurity disclosures; evaluation standards could be used to determine the effectiveness of an organizations cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures.6  We believe it is essential that all public, private, not for profit, and governmental organizations, and other interested parties work toward a global solution that would provide insight into how organizations leverage their resources to address cybersecurity risks. The AICPA believes the adoption of a globally accepted reporting and evaluation reporting framework would have the following benefits:  • Providing organizations with a common language to use when designing their cybersecurity risk management programs, preparing cybersecurity disclosures and when evaluating the effectiveness of their cybersecurity policies and procedures • Providing decision useful cybersecurity information in a manner that enhances consistency and comparability among organizations  • Reducing the communication and compliance burden on organizations, which often have to comply with a number of diverse cybersecurity frameworks and assessment programs)  Furthermore, the AICPA believes that its Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program provides robust standards that can be used as the basis for a globally accepted cybersecurity reporting framework (as noted previously, the Description Criteria are principles based rather than rules based to support the ability of organizations to meet the differing cybersecurity risk management information needs of a variety of stakeholders). Use of a global set of reporting and evaluation standards, when coupled with CPA involvement, can enhance the trust and confidence users place in cybersecurity information. For example, boards of directors and audit committees may find a CPAs report7 helpful in meeting their oversight responsibilities. Managing Third Party Risks Through SOC 2 Reports. Most organizations rely on third party service providers to perform critical business functions. To achieve their commitments to customers and others and to comply with law and regulations to which they are subject, organizations often need to obtain assurances from those third party service providers that their systems and controls support the organizations objectives. Because of the number of divergent cybersecurity frameworks in the market today, the cybersecurity landscape is a confusing place for organizations, stakeholders and other interested parties who want to know more about service providers cybersecurity efforts. Now, as never before, there is a need for clarity around the types of cybersecurity disclosures that would best meet the information needs of users. As noted in the proposed disclosures around risk management and strategy, this issue can best be addressed by providing investors with consistent, comparable information about how organizations oversee and manage their cybersecurity risks, including the risks that arise from doing business with third party service providers. 6 Ideally, that same disclosure and evaluation criteria could be used by CPAs (or other independent, third party assessors) to provide assurance on that information, if and when the market demands it.  7 In accordance with the AICPAs attestation standards, CPAs may examine and report on whether disclosures included in a description of an organizations cybersecurity risk management program are presented in accordance with the Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program. 7  Part of the AICPAs SOC suite of services, SOC 2 reports were developed to meet the needs of a broad range of users by addressing the processes and controls that affect the security, availability, and processing integrity of the systems used to process users data, and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by those systems. SOC 2 reports include a robust description of the systems used by a service provider to provide services to users and, in most cases, an evaluation of the effectiveness of system controls to achieve the providers service commitments and system requirements. They also generally include an independent CPAs opinion on whether (a) the description is presented in accordance with the AICPAs Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organizations System in a SOC 2® Report and (b) the security policies and procedures are suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve those commitments and requirements. The increased demand for SOC 2 reports over the past several years demonstrates the value that organizations place on such reports for managing a number of third party risks, including cybersecurity, availability, and confidentiality. Assurance  For decades, CPAs have been enhancing the confidence users have in historical financial statements through the audit process. Audited financial statements are trusted because the market understands the benefits of having an independent CPA provide an audit.  Likewise, CPAs can provide assurance on cybersecurity information by applying the AICPAs Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs), while at the same time complying with the AICPAs Code of Professional Conduct and Statements on Quality Control Standards.  These standards require CPAs to be independent, have the appropriate competence and capabilities including sufficient knowledge of the subject matter, follow supervision and review requirements, and incorporate the work of specialists, when necessary, among other requirements. In addition, work performed by CPAs is subject to quality monitoring programs (including reviews of engagements and quality management reviews) intended to enhance the quality of the work performed.  Today, many CPA firms employ both licensed CPAs and information technology and security specialists.  Using a set of suitable criteria (such as the Description Criteria for Managements Description of the Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program and the 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy), CPA firms can provide assurance on an organizations cybersecurity disclosures, and on the effectiveness of its cybersecurity controls and other activities it uses to mitigate identified cybersecurity risks. Boards of directors and audit committees may find CPAs reports on such management prepared information helpful in meeting their oversight responsibilities.8  Structured data  We agree with the SECs proposal that cybersecurity information be provided in Inline XBRL format. Submission in this format allows for the information to be more efficiently searched, consumed, and analyzed by investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. Structuring cybersecurity information in this manner would offer users a cost effective manner to consume this information, similarly to how they consume financial information.  8 A CPA may examine and report on such information in accordance with the AT C sections 105 and 205 of the AICPAs Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements. A CPAs SOC for Cybersecurity examination, performed in accordance with those same standards and the AICPA guide, Reporting on an Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program and Controls, would also result in a CPAs opinion on a description of an organizations cybersecurity risk management program as well as an opinion on the operating effectiveness of the cybersecurity controls within that program.  8  We appreciate the SEC taking leadership on this critical issue and would be pleased to discuss our comments or answer any questions regarding the AICPA Cybersecurity Reporting framework and the views expressed in this letter.

These description criteria are to be used when preparing and evaluating the description of the ser vice organizations system (description) in an examination of a service organizations controls over se curity, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy (SOC 2® examination). This docu ment presents the description criteria for use in that examination. (The AICPAs trust services criteria are not addressed in this document. fn 1 Those criteria are used in a SOC 2® examination to evaluate whether controls stated in the description were suitably designed and operated effectively to provide rea sonable assurance that the service organizations service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria.) .02 Applying the description criteria requires judgment. Therefore, in addition to the description criteria, this document also presents implementation guidance for each criterion. The implementation guidance pre sents factors to consider when making judgments about the nature and extent of disclosures called for by each criterion. This guidance does not address all possible situations; therefore, users should carefully consider the facts and circumstances of the service organization and its environment when applying the description criteria.  Applicability and Use of the Description Criteria SOC 2® Examination .03 The description criteria presented in this document were developed to be used in conjunction with the SOC 2® examination described in AICPA Guide SOC 2® Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Ser vice Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy (guide). The SOC 2® examination is performed in accordance with AT C section 105, Concepts Com mon to All Attestation Engagements, and AT C section 205, Examination Engagements (AICPA, Pro    fn 1 The trust services criteria were issued in 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Con fidentiality, and Privacy and are codified in TSP section 100 (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria). Paragraphs .25 .26 of TSP sec tion 100 provide transition guidance related to the use of those criteria in a service auditors report. 2 ©2018 AICPA  fessional Standards). In that examination, the CPA (known as a service auditor) fn 2 expresses an opin ion about the following: a. Whether the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria b. Whether the controls were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service or ganizations service commitments and system requirements would be achieved if controls oper ated effectively based on the applicable trust services criteria c. In a type 2 examination, fn 3 whether the controls operated effectively to provide reasonable as surance that the service organizations service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. fn 4  .04 A SOC 2® examination is predicated on the concept that, because service organization management is ulti mately responsible for developing, implementing, and operating the service organizations system, ser vice organization management is also responsible for developing and presenting in the SOC 2® report a description of the service organizations system. Service organization management uses the description criteria in this document when preparing the description of the service organizations system; the service auditor uses the criteria when evaluating whether the description is presented in accordance with the de scription criteria. Suitability and Availability of the Description Criteria .05 According to the attestation standards, the attributes of suitable criteria are as follows: fn 5  • Relevance. Criteria are relevant to the subject matter.    fn 2 In the attestation standards, a CPA performing an attestation engagement ordinarily is referred to as a practitioner. However, the AICPA Guide SOC 2® Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Securi ty, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy uses the term service auditor, rather than practitioner, to refer to a CPA reporting on controls at a service organization. Therefore, this document also uses the term service auditor.  fn 3 There are two types of SOC 2® examinations (type 1 and type 2), and the subject matters vary depending on which type of examination the service auditor performs. The subject matters of a type 1 examination are (a) the description and (b) the suitability of the design of the controls to provide reasonable assurance that the service organizations service commitments and system requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. The subject mat ters in a type 2 examination are (a) the description, (b) the suitability of design of the controls to provide reasonable that the service organizations service commitments and system requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, and (c) the operating effectiveness of controls to provide reasonable assurance that the service organiza tions service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. fn 4 This term refers to the trust services criteria in TSP section 100, 2017Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria), that pertain to the category or categories included within the scope of the particular examination. fn 5 Paragraph .A42 of AT C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements (AICPA, Professional Stand ards).  ©2018 AICPA 3 • Objectivity. Criteria are free from bias. • Measurability. Criteria permit reasonably consistent measurements, qualitative or quantitative, of subject matter. • Completeness. Criteria are complete when subject matter prepared in accordance with them does not omit relevant factors that could reasonably be expected to affect users decisions made on the basis of that subject matter. .06 In addition to being suitable, AT C section 105 fn 6 indicates that the criteria used in an attestation engage ment should be available to report users. The publication of the description criteria makes the criteria available to report users. Accordingly, ASEC has concluded that the description criteria presented in this document are suitable and available for use in a SOC 2® examination.  Preparing and Evaluating the Presentation of the Description of the Service Organiza tions System in Accordance With the Description Criteria .07 Service organization management is responsible for the design, implementation, and operation of controls within the system used to provide services to user entities and business partners. In a SOC 2® examina tion, a description of the service organizations system presented in accordance with the description cri teria is designed to enable user entities, business partners, and other intended users of the SOC 2® report (known collectively as report users) to understand the service organizations system, including the pro cessing and flow of data and information through and from the system. The description describes the procedures and controls the service organization has implemented to manage the risks that threaten the achievement of the service organizations service commitments and system requirements. The descrip tion is prepared by service organization management from documentation supporting the system of in ternal control and system operations, as well as consideration of the policies, processes, and procedures within the system used to provide the services. .08 A SOC 2® report is intended for use by those who have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the ser vice organization, the services it provides, and the system used to provide those services, among other matters. As a result, when drafting the description, service organization management can assume that users have such knowledge and understanding. Furthermore, if the users do not have such knowledge and understanding, they are likely to misunderstand the content of the SOC 2® report, the assertions made by management, and the service auditors opinion, all of which are included in the report. For that reason, management and the service auditor should agree on the intended users of the report (referred to as specified parties). Specified parties of a SOC 2® report may include service organization personnel, user entities of the system throughout some or all of the period, business partners subject to risks arising from interactions with the system, practitioners providing services to user entities and business partners, prospective user entities and business partners, and regulators who have sufficient knowledge and un derstanding of such matters.  .09 Though the description is generally narrative in nature, there is no prescribed format for the description. Flowcharts, matrixes, tables, graphics, context diagrams, or a combination thereof may be used to sup plement the narratives contained within the description.    fn 6 Paragraph .25b of AT C section 105. 4 ©2018 AICPA  .10 Additionally, the description can be organized in a variety of ways. For example, the description may be or ganized by components of internal control (the control environment, risk assessment process, control ac tivities, monitoring activities, and information and communications). Alternatively, it may be organized by components of the system (infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data) and supplemented by disclosures of the aspects of the internal control components relevant to the identification and as sessment of risks that would prevent the service organization from achieving its service commitments and system requirements and the design, implementation, and operation of controls to address them. .11 The extent of disclosures included in the description may vary depending on the size and complexity of the service organization and its activities. In addition, the description need not address every aspect of the service organizations system or the services provided by the system, particularly if certain aspects of those services are not relevant to report users or are beyond the scope of the SOC 2® examination. For example, disclosures about a service organizations processes related to billing for the services provided to user entities are unlikely to be relevant to report users. Similarly, although the description includes procedures within both manual and automated systems by which services are provided, it need not nec essarily disclose every step in the process.  .12 Ordinarily, a description of a service organizations system in a SOC 2® examination is presented in accord ance with the description criteria when it (a) describes the system that the service organization has im plemented (that is, placed in operation) to provide the services, (b) includes information about each de scription criterion, to the extent it is relevant to the system being described, and (c) does not inadvertent ly or intentionally omit or distort information that is likely to be relevant to report users decisions. Alt hough the description should include disclosures about each description criterion, such disclosures are not intended to be made at such a detailed level that they might increase the likelihood that a hostile par ty could exploit a security vulnerability, thereby compromising the service organizations ability to achieve its service commitments and system requirements. Instead, the disclosures are intended to ena ble report users to understand the nature of the risks faced by the service organization and the impact of the realization of those risks. .13 A description is not presented in accordance with the description criteria if it (a) states or implies that cer tain IT components exist when they do not, (b) states or implies that certain processes and controls have been implemented when they are not being performed, or (c) contains statements that cannot be objec tively evaluated (for example, advertising puffery). • .14 In certain circumstances, additional disclosures may be necessary to supplement the descrip tion. Managements decisions about whether such additional disclosures are necessary and the service auditors evaluation of managements decisions involve consideration of whether the dis closures may affect information that is likely to be relevant to the decisions of report users. Addi tional disclosures may include the following, for example:Significant interpretations made in ap plying the description criteria in the specific circumstances of the SOC 2® examination (for ex ample, what constitutes a security event or incident) • Subsequent events, depending on their nature and significance Materiality Considerations When Preparing and Evaluating Whether the Description Is Presented in Accordance With the Description Criteria .15 As discussed in paragraph .02, applying the description criteria requires judgment. One of those judgments involves the informational needs of report users. Most SOC 2® reports have a broad range of specified  ©2018 AICPA 5 parties. Therefore, the description is intended to meet the common informational needs of the specified parties and does not ordinarily include information about every aspect of the system that may be consid ered important to each individual report user. However, an understanding of the perspectives and infor mation needs of the broad range of intended SOC 2® report users is necessary to determine whether the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria and is sufficient to meet report users needs.  .16 When evaluating whether the description is in accordance with the description criteria, management consid ers whether misstatements or omissions in the description, individually or in the aggregate, could rea sonably be expected to influence decisions of specified parties to the SOC 2® report. For example, in a SOC 2® examination on controls relevant to privacy, management may discover that is has failed to de scribe a principal service commitment involving compliance with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation. Because such information could reasonably be expected to influence the deci sions of SOC 2® report users, management may conclude that the omission of such information may af fect the decisions of such users. In that case, management would amend the description by including the relevant information. fn 7  .17 Because the description criteria call for disclosure of primarily nonfinancial information, most descriptions will be presented in narrative form. Therefore, materiality considerations are mainly qualitative in nature and center around whether there are misstatements in information that could reasonably be expected to influence report users decisions, including the possibility that relevant information has been omitted. Qualitative factors to be considered include the following: • Whether the description of the service organizations system includes the significant aspects of system processing • Whether the description is prepared at a level of detail likely to be meaningful to report users • Whether each of the relevant description criteria in paragraph .19 has been addressed without us ing language that omits or distorts the information • Whether the characteristics of the presentation are appropriate, because the description criteria allow for variations in presentation Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organizations System in a SOC 2® Ex amination and Related Implementation Guidance .18 To be presented in accordance with the description criteria, a description ordinarily needs to disclose infor mation about each of the requirements (criteria) presented in the left column of the following table, to the extent that the criterion is applicable to the system and the trust services categories included within the scope of the examination. (Materiality considerations are discussed in the previous section beginning at paragraph .15.)    fn 7 If the description has been prepared to meet the informational needs of a specific subset of SOC 2® report users (and the report is restricted to those specific users), management considers whether misstatements (including omissions) may affect the decisions of that specific subset of report users.  6 ©2018 AICPA  .19 The implementation guidance in the right column of the following table presents factors to consider when making judgments about the nature and extent of disclosures called for by each criterion. The implemen tation guidance does not address all possible situations; therefore, service organization management is advised to carefully consider the specific facts and circumstances of the service organization and the na ture of the services provided when applying the description criteria in a SOC 2® examination. Description Criteria Implementation Guidance The description contains the fol lowing information: When making judgments about the nature and extent of disclo sures to include about this criterion, consider the following: DC 1: The types of services pro vided Examples of the types of services provided by service organiza tions are as follows:  • Customer support. Providing customers of user entities with online or telephonic post sales sup port and service management. Examples of these services are warranty inquiries and investigating and responding to customer complaints. • Health care claims management and processing. Providing medical providers, employers, third party administrators, and insured parties of em ployers with systems that enable medical records and related health insurance claims to be pro cessed accurately, securely, and confidentially. • Enterprise IT outsourcing services. Managing, operating, and maintaining user entities IT data centers, infrastructure, and application systems and related functions that support IT activities, such as network, production, security, change management, hardware, and environmental con trol activities. • Managed security. Managing access to networks and computing systems for user entities (for ex ample, granting access to a system and prevent ing, or detecting and mitigating, system intru sion). • Financial technology (FinTech) services. Providing financial services companies with in formation technology based transaction pro cessing services. Examples of such transactions are loan processing, peer to peer lending, pay ment processing, crowdfunding, big data analyt ics, and asset management. DC 2: The principal service com mitments and system requirements A system of internal control is evaluated using the trust services criteria within the context of the entitys ability to achieve its  ©2018 AICPA 7 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance business objectives and sub objectives. When a service organi zation provides services to user entities, its objectives and sub objectives relate primarily to the following: a. The achievement of the service commitments made to user entities related to the system used to provide the services and the system require ments necessary to achieve those commitments b. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding the provision of the services by the system c. The achievement of the other objectives the ser vice organization has for the system. These are referred to as the service organizations service commitments and system requirements. Although service organization management is responsible for designing, implementing, and operating controls to provide rea sonable assurance that it achieves its system objectives, man agement is required to disclose in the description only its prin cipal service commitments and system requirements, as dis cussed in the subsequent section.  Principal Service Commitments. Disclosure of the principal service commitments and system requirements enables report users to understand the objectives that drive the operation of the system and how the applicable trust services criteria were used to evaluate whether controls were suitably designed and operat ed effectively.  Service commitments include those made to user entities and others (such as customers of user entities), to the extent those commitments relate to the trust services category or categories addressed by the description. For example, service commit ments could also include those made as part of the National In stitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) risk management framework for government agencies and other parties.  The service commitments a service organization makes to user entities and others are based on the needs of those entities. In identifying the service commitments to be disclosed, service organization management may begin by reviewing the com mitments it made to user entities. Service commitments may be communicated to user entities in many ways, such as through contracts, service level agreements, and published policies (for example, a privacy policy). No specific form of communication is required.  A service organization may make service commitments on many different aspects of the service being described, including the following: 8 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance • Specification of the algorithm used in a calcula tion • The hours a system will be available • Published password standards • Encryption standards used to encrypt stored cus tomer data Service commitments may also be made about one or more of the trust services categories addressed by the description. As an example, if controls over privacy are addressed by the descrip tion, a service organization may make commitments such as the following:  • The organization will not process or transfer in formation without obtaining the data subjects consent. • The organization will provide a privacy notice to customers once every 6 months or when there is a change in the organizations business policies. • The organization will respond to access requests within 10 working days of receiving the request from its customers.  Service organization management need not disclose every ser vice commitment, but only those that are relevant to the broad range of SOC 2® report users (that is, the principal service commitments). For example, when the description addresses availability, a service organization may make the same system availability commitment to the majority of its user entities. Be cause information about the availability commitment common to most user entities is likely to be relevant to the broad range of SOC 2® report users, service organization management would describe that principal availability commitment in the description.  In other cases, however, a service organization may make a dif ferent commitment about system availability to an individual user entity that requires greater system availability than most user entities. Service organization management ordinarily would not disclose that commitment because it is unlikely to be relevant to the broad range of SOC 2® report users. Because that service commitment is not disclosed in the description, the individual user entity understands that the evaluation of the  ©2018 AICPA 9 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance suitability of design of controls and, in a type 2 examination, the operating effectiveness of controls was made based on the service organizations achievement of its principal service commitments and system requirements (that is, those common to the majority of user entities); therefore, the individual user entity may need to obtain additional information from the ser vice organization regarding the achievement of its specific availability commitment.  When the description addresses privacy, service organization management discloses the service commitments and system requirements identified in the service organizations privacy notice or in its privacy policy that are relevant to the system being described. When making such disclosures, it may also be helpful to report users if service organization management de scribes the purposes, uses, and disclosures of personal infor mation as permitted by user entity agreements.  Principal System Requirements. System requirements are the specifications about how the system should function to do the following:  • Meet the service organizations service com mitments to user entities and others (such as user entities customers) • Meet the service organizations commitments to vendors and business partners • Comply with relevant laws and regulations and guidelines of industry groups, such as business or trade associations • Achieve other objectives of the service organiza tion that are relevant to the trust services catego ries addressed by the description. Requirements are often specified in the service organizations system policies and procedures, system design documentation, contracts with customers, and government regulations. The following are examples of system requirements:  • Workforce member fingerprinting and back ground checks established in government bank ing regulations • System edits that restrict the values accepted for system input, which are defined in application 10 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance design documents • Maximum acceptable intervals between periodic review of workforce member logical access as documented in the security policy manual • Data definition and tagging standards, including any associated metadata requirements, estab lished by industry groups or other bodies, such as the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) • Business processing rules and standards estab lished by regulators, for example, security re quirements under the Health Insurance Portabil ity and Accountability Act (HIPAA) System requirements may result from the service organizations commitments relating to one or more of the trust services cate gories (for example, a commitment to programmatically en force segregation of duties between data entry and data approv al creates system requirements regarding user access admin istration). The principal system requirements that need to be disclosed are those that are relevant to the trust services category or catego ries addressed by the description and that are likely to be rele vant to the broad range of SOC 2® report users. In identifying which system requirements to disclose, service organization management may consider internal policies that are relevant to the system being described, key decisions made in the design and operation of the system, and other business requirements for the system. For example, internal requirements related to the operating margin for the services associated with the system are not relevant to the broad range of SOC 2® report users and, therefore, need not be disclosed.  DC 3: The components of the sys tem used to provide the services, including the following: a. Infrastructure b. Software c. People d. Procedures e. Data Infrastructure. Disclosures about the infrastructure component include matters such as the collection of physical or virtual re sources that supports an overall IT environment, including the physical environment and related structures, IT, and related hardware (for example, facilities, servers, storage, environmen tal monitoring equipment, data storage devices and media, mo bile devices, and internal networks and connected external tele communications networks) that the service organization uses to provide the services.  Software. Disclosures about the software component include matters such as the application programs, the IT system soft ware that supports those application programs (operating sys  ©2018 AICPA 11 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance tems, middleware, and utilities), the types of databases used, the nature of external facing web applications, and the nature of applications developed in house, including details about whether the applications in use are mobile applications or desk top and laptop applications. People. Disclosures about the people component include the personnel involved in the governance, management, operation, security, and use of the system (business unit personnel, devel opers, operators, user entity personnel, vendor personnel, and managers). Procedures. Disclosures about the automated and manual pro cedures implemented by the service organization primarily re late to those through which services are provided. These in clude, as appropriate, procedures through which service activi ties are initiated, authorized, performed, and delivered, and re ports and other information prepared.  A process consists of a series of linked procedures designed to accomplish a particular goal (for example, the process for man aging third party risks). Procedures are the specific actions un dertaken to implement a process (for example, the procedure in place to assess and manage the requisition and engagement of vendors). For that reason, service organization management may find it easier to describe procedures in the context of the process of which they are a part.  Policies are management or board member statements of what should be done to effect control. Such statements may be doc umented, explicitly stated in communications, or implied through actions and decisions. Policies serve as the basis for procedures. The service organization deploys control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action. Reports and other information prepared by the service organi zation may also be included in the description to enable report users to better understand the order of activities performed by the service organization.  System components may also be described using specific tech nical terms that will help create a clearer understanding of the service organizations system and system boundaries. Tech nical terms can also aid report users in understanding the ser vice organizations physical and logical components when con sidering a service organizations impact on the user entities. It may be helpful for service organizations to enhance their sys tem descriptions using open systems interconnect (OSI) seven layer model concepts. An organization could describe how and on which layer specific components of the system are operated, 12 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance for example, with a statement such as this: Encrypted connections are made to the service organization using client virtual private network (VPN) hardware that connects system users via secure shell (SSH) to secure file transfer proto col (SFTP) servers that operate following transport layer security (TLS) standards and pro tocols. Data. Disclosures about the data component include types of data used by the system, transaction streams, files, databases, tables, and output used or processed by the system. When the description addresses the confidentiality or privacy categories, other matters that may be considered for disclosure about the data component include the following: • The principal types of data created, collected, processed, transmitted, used, or stored by the service organization and the methods used to collect, retain, disclose, dispose of, or anony mize the data  • Personal information that warrants security, data protection, or breach disclosures based on laws or commitments (for example, personally identi fiable information, protected health information, and payment card data) • Third party entity information (for example, in formation subject to confidentiality requirements in contracts) that warrants security, data protec tion, or breach disclosures based on laws or commitments When the description addresses controls over confidentiality and privacy, management would address, at a minimum, all the system components as they relate to the information life cycle of the confidential and personal information used in providing the service within well defined processes and informal ad hoc procedures. Boundaries of the system. Not all activities performed at the service organization are part of the system being described. De termining the functions or processes that are outside the bound aries of the system and describing them in the description may be necessary to prevent report users from misunderstanding the boundaries of the system. Therefore, if there is a risk that report users might be confused about whether a specific function or  ©2018 AICPA 13 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance process is part of the system being described, the description needs to clarify which processes or functions are included in the examination. For example, the following functions or processes at the service organization may be outside the boundaries of the system being described: • The process used to invoice user entities for the services provided by the service organization. • The conversion of new user entities to the ser vice organizations systems. For some service organizations, such conversions are handled by an entirely different system than the one being described.  • The receipt of data from sources outside the sys tem being described. An example is a payroll processing system that receives information in puts from an employer in a ready to process state, which limits the responsibility of the ser vice organizations system to processing the in puts provided by the employer to produce direct bank deposits to specified bank accounts. Third Party Access. Vendors, business partners, and others (third parties) often store, process, and transmit sensitive data or otherwise access a service organizations system. These third parties may provide components of the system. Service organi zation management may need to describe the components of the system provided by such third parties. Such disclosures may include, for example, the nature of the third parties access and connectivity to the service organizations system. DC 4: For identified system inci dents that (a) were the result of controls that were not suitably de signed or operating effectively or (b) otherwise resulted in a signifi cant failure in the achievement of one or more of those service commitments and system require ments, as of the date of the de scription (for a type 1) or during the period of time covered by the description (for a type 2), as appli cable, the following information: Judgment is needed when determining whether to disclose an incident. However, consideration of the following matters as they relate to the system being described may help make that determination:  • Whether the incident resulted from one or more controls that were not suitably designed or oper ating effectively  • Whether the incident resulted in a significant failure in the achievement of one or more of the service organizations service commitments and system requirements 14 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance a. Nature of each in cident b. Timing surrounding the incident c. Extent (or effect) of the incident and its disposition • Whether public disclosure of the incident was required (or is likely to be required) by cyberse curity laws or regulations  • Whether the incident had a material effect on the service organizations financial position or re sults of operations and required disclosure in a financial statement filing • Whether the incident resulted in sanctions by any legal or regulatory agency • Whether the incident resulted in the service or ganizations withdrawal from material markets or cancellation of material contracts Disclosures about identified security incidents are not intended to be made at a detailed level, which might increase the likeli hood that a hostile party could exploit a security vulnerability, thereby compromising the service organizations ability to achieve its service commitments and system requirements. Ra ther, the disclosures are intended to enable report users to un derstand the nature of the risks faced by the service organiza tion and the impact of the realization of those risks. Assume that the service organization identified a security breach that resulted in the service organizations failure to achieve one or more of its service commitments and system requirements. The breach, which occurred six months prior to the start of the period covered by the description, had not been fully remediated during the period covered by the description. In this example, management would likely need to disclose the incident in the description to enable report users to understand the nature of the risks faced by the service organization and the impact of the realization of those risks. In addition, service organization management should consider whether to disclose known incidents at a subservice organiza tion, regardless of whether management has elected to use the inclusive or carve out method. DC 5: The applicable trust ser vices criteria and the related con trols designed to provide reasona ble assurance that the service or ganizations service commitments and system requirements were achieved TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria), presents the criteria for each of the trust services categories. A description is presented in accordance with this criterion when it includes information about each of the criteria related to the trust services category or categories covered by the description (applicable trust ser vices criteria), including controls related to the control envi ronment, risk assessment process, information and communica  ©2018 AICPA 15 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance tion, monitoring activities, and control activities. For example, if the description addresses availability, management would provide information about the controls it has implemented to address the common criteria in the trust services criteria and the additional trust services criteria for availability. DC 6: If service organization management assumed, in the de sign of the service organizations system, that certain controls would be implemented by user entities, and those controls are necessary, in combination with controls at the service organization, to provide reasonable assurance that the ser vice organizations service com mitments and system requirements would be achieved, those comple mentary user entity controls (CUECs) Complementary User Entity Controls. CUECs are those con trols that service organization management assumed, in the de sign of the system, would be implemented by user entities and are necessary, in combination with controls at the service or ganization, to provide reasonable assurance that the service or ganizations service commitments and system requirements would be achieved. Usually, a service organization can achieve its service com mitments and system requirements without depending on the implementation of CUECs at user entities because the service organization restricts its service commitments and system re quirements to those matters that are its responsibility and that it can reasonably perform. Consider trust services criterion (CC) 6.2:  Prior to issuing system credentials and granting system access, the entity registers and authorizes new internal and external users whose access is administered by the entity. For those users whose access is administered by the entity, user system credentials are removed when user ac cess is no longer authorized.  CC 6.2 limits the service organizations responsibilities because the criterion requires only that the system register a user (iden tified by the user entity as an authorized user) and issue system credentials to that user after the user entity supplies the service organization with a list of authorized users. The user entity is responsible for identifying the users and supplying the service organization with a list of authorized users. If the user entity provides a list that inadvertently includes employees who are not authorized, the service organization has still met the criteri on. Accordingly, identifying the authorized users and com municating that information to the service organization are not considered CUECs. The description is presented in accordance with this criterion if the CUECs are complete, accurately described, and relevant to the service organizations achievement of its service commit ments and system requirements.  User Entity Responsibilities. In addition to CUECs, user enti ties may have other responsibilities when using the system. Those responsibilities are necessary for the user entity to derive 16 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance the intended benefits of using the services of the service organ ization. For example, the user of an express delivery service is responsible for providing complete and accurate recipient in formation and for using appropriate packaging materials. Such responsibilities are referred to as user entity responsibilities.  Trust services criterion CC 2.3 states [t]he entity communicates with external parties regarding matters affecting the function ing of internal control. This would include communication of user responsibilities. However, because user entity responsibili ties can be voluminous, they are often communicated through other methods (for example, by describing them in user manu als). Consequently, disclosure of user entity responsibilities in the description is usually not practical. Instead, management ordinarily identifies in the description the types of communica tions it makes to external users about user entity responsibili ties. The form and content of such communication is the re sponsibility of service organization management. When service organization management communicates user entity responsibilities only to specific parties (such as in con tracts with user entities), management considers whether other intended users of the SOC 2® report are likely to misunderstand it; in that case, management should limit the use of the report to those specific parties. If service organization management does not want to limit the use of the report, management would in clude the significant user entity responsibilities in the descrip tion of the service organizations system to prevent users from misunderstanding the system and the service auditors report. In that case, the report would be appropriate for the broad range of SOC 2® users.  When service organization management includes significant user entity responsibilities in the description, management evaluates those disclosures as part of its evaluation about whether the description is presented in accordance with the de scription criteria. DC 7: If the service organization uses a subservice organization and the controls at the subservice or ganization are necessary, in com bination with controls at the ser vice organization, to provide rea sonable assurance that the service organizations service commit ments and system requirements are achieved, the following: a. When service or Inclusive method. When service organization management elects the inclusive method, the relevant aspects of the sub service organizations infrastructure, software, people, proce dures and data are considered part of the service organizations system and are included in the description of the service organ izations system. Although the relevant aspects are considered a part of the service organizations system, the portions of the system that are attributable to the subservice organization would be separately identified in the description. Such disclo sures include the aspects of the internal control components relevant to identification and assessment of risks that would prevent the service organization from achieving its service  ©2018 AICPA 17 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance ganization man agement elects to use the inclusive method: i. The nature of the ser vice provid ed by the subservice organization ii. The controls at the sub service or ganization that are nec essary, in combination with con trols at the service or ganization to provide reasonable assurance that the ser vice organi zations ser vice com mitments and system require ments are achieved  iii. Relevant aspects of the sub service or ganizations infrastruc ture, soft ware, peo ple, proce dures, and data iv. The portions of the sys commitments and system requirements and the design, imple mentation, and operation of controls to address them.  The description would separately identify controls at the ser vice organization and controls at the subservice organization. However, there is no prescribed format for differentiating be tween the two. Carve out method. When service organization management elects the carve out method, consideration may be given to dis closure of the identity of the subservice organization when such information may be useful to user entities or business partners who want to obtain information about and perform procedures related to the services provided by the subservice organization. Complementary subservice organization controls (CSOCs) are controls that service organization management assumed, in the design of the system, would be implemented by subservice or ganizations and are necessary, in combination with controls at the service organization to provide reasonable assurance that the service organizations service commitments and system re quirements were achieved. When using the carve out method, the description would identify the types of CSOCs that the sub service organization is assumed to have implemented.  It is important that the description also includes the subservice organizations responsibilities for implementing those CSOCs and indicates that the related service commitments and system requirements can be achieved only if the CSOCs are suitably designed and operating effectively during the period addressed by the description.  To be meaningful to report users, management includes only CSOCs that are specific to the services provided by the system being described. CSOCs may be presented as broad categories of controls or as control objectives rather than as individual controls.  Service organization management may wish to include in the description a table that identifies those instances in which ser vice commitments and system requirements are achieved solely by the service organizations controls and those in which a combination of controls at the service organization and CSOCs are needed to provide reasonable assurance that the service or ganizations service commitments and system requirements were achieved. Examples of CSOCs include the following: • Controls relevant to the completeness and accu racy of transaction processing on behalf of the 18 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance tem that are attributable to the sub service or ganization b. When service or ganization man agement decides to use the carve out method: i. The nature of the ser vice provid ed by the subservice organization  ii. Each of the applicable trust ser vices crite ria that are intended to be met by controls at the sub service or ganization iii. The types of controls that service or ganization manage ment as sumed, in the design of the ser vice organi zations sys tem, would be imple mented by the sub service or ganization that are nec essary, in service organization • Controls relevant to the completeness and accu racy of specified reports provided to and used by the service organization • General IT controls relevant to the processing performed for the service organization • Data centers are protected against a disruption in power supply to the processing environment by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The description is presented in accordance with this criterion if the CSOCs are complete, accurately described, and relevant to the service organizations achievement of the service commit ments and system requirements related to the system being de scribed.  Other matters. A service organization that uses multiple sub service organizations may prepare its description using the carve out method for one or more subservice organizations and the inclusive method for others. Regardless of the method service organization management selects, the description needs to disclose controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organizations service commitments and system requirements are achieved, which include controls that the service organization uses to monitor the services provided by the subservice organization. Such monitoring controls may include, but are not limited to, a combination of the following: • Testing of controls at the subservice organiza tion by members of the service organizations internal audit function • Reviewing and reconciling output reports • Holding periodic discussions with the subservice organization personnel and evaluating sub service organization performance against estab lished service level objectives and agreements • Making site visits to the subservice organization • Inspecting type 2 SOC 2® reports on the sub service organizations system  ©2018 AICPA 19 Description Criteria Implementation Guidance combination with con trols at the service or ganization, to provide reasonable assurance that the ser vice organi zations ser vice com mitments and system require ments are achieved (commonly referred to as comple mentary subservice organization controls or CSOCs)  • Monitoring external communications, such as complaints from user entities relevant to the ser vices performed by the subservice organization DC 8: Any specific criterion of the applicable trust services criteria that is not relevant to the system and the reasons it is not relevant  If one or more applicable trust services criteria are not relevant to the system being described, service organization manage ment includes in the description an explanation of why such criteria are not relevant. For example, an applicable trust ser vices criterion may not be relevant if it does not apply to the services provided by the service organization. Assume user entities—not the service organization—collect personal information from the user entities customers. When the description addresses controls over privacy, service organi zation management would not disclose in its description the user entities controls over collection; however, the reason for that omission would be disclosed. In contrast, the existence of a policy prohibiting certain activities is not sufficient to render a criterion not applicable. For example, when the description ad dresses controls over privacy, it would be inappropriate for ser vice organization management to omit from the description dis closures of personal information to third parties based only on the fact that the service organizations policies forbid such dis closures. Instead, the description would describe the policies and related controls for preventing or detecting such disclo sures. 20 ©2018 AICPA  Description Criteria Implementation Guidance DC 9: In a description that covers a period of time (type 2 examina tion), the relevant details of signif icant changes to the service organ izations system and controls dur ing that period that are relevant to the service organizations service commitments and system require ments Significant changes to be disclosed consist of those that are likely to be relevant to the broad range of report users. Disclo sure of such changes is expected to include an appropriate level of detail, such as the date the changes occurred and how the system differed before and after the changes. Examples of significant changes to a system include the follow ing: • Changes to the services provided  • Significant changes to IT and security personnel • Significant changes to system processes, IT ar chitecture and applications, and the processes and system used by subservice organizations • Changes to legal and regulatory requirements that could affect system requirements • Changes to organizational structure resulting in a change to internal control over the system (for example, a change to the legal entity) Transition Guidance .20 The description criteria presented in this document (2018 description criteria) have been designed to be used in conjunction with the use of the 2017 trust services criteria set forth in TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy in a SOC 2® report. The 2018 description criteria will be codified as DC section 200 in AICPA, Description Crite ria. The description criteria included in paragraphs 1.26 .27 of the AICPA Guide Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy (SOC 2®) (2015 description criteria) will be codified as DC section 200A.  .21 When preparing a description of the service organizations system as of December 15, 2018, or prior to that date (type 1 examination) or a description for periods ending as of December 15, 2018, or prior to that date (type 2 examination), either the 2018 description criteria or the 2015 description criteria may be used. (To ensure that the 2015 description criteria are available to report users, such criteria will remain in DC section 200A through December 31, 2019.) During this transition period, management should identify in the description whether the 2018 description criteria or the 2015 description criteria were used.  .22 When preparing a description of the service organizations system as of or after December 16, 2018, (type 1 examination) or a description of the system for periods ending as of or after that date (type 2 examina tion), the 2018 description criteria should be used. ©2018 AICPA 21 Appendix — Glossary .23 For purposes of this document, the following terms have the meanings attributed as follows: applicable trust services criteria.

The boundaries of a system are the specific as pects of a service organizations infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data necessary to provide its services. When systems for multiple services share aspects, infrastructure, soft ware, people, procedures, and data, the systems will overlap, but the boundaries of each system will differ. In a SOC 2® engagement that addresses the confidentiality and privacy criteria, the system boundaries cover, at a minimum, all the system components as they relate to the life cycle of the confidential and personal information within well defined processes and informal ad hoc procedures. business partner.

Notice to Readers The 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy presents control criteria established by the Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) of the AICPA for use in attestation or consulting engagements to evaluate and report on controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of information and systems (a) across an entire entity; (b) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; (c) within a function relevant to the entitys operational, reporting, or compliance objectives; or (d) for a particular type of information used by the entity. In developing and establishing these criteria, ASEC followed due process procedures, including expo sure of criteria for public comment. BL section 360R, Implementing Resolutions Under Section 3.6 Committees, fn 1 designates ASEC as a senior technical committee with the authority to make public statements without clearance from the AICPA council or the board of directors. Paragraph .A44 of AT C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, fn 2 indicates that criteria promulgated by a body designated by the Council of the AICPA under the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct are, by definition, considered suitable.  This version of the trust services criteria has been modified by AICPA staff to include conforming changes necessary because of the issuance, in March 2020, of a new SOC examination. In a SOC for Supply Chain examination, a practitioner examines and reports on the effectiveness of controls (suitabil ity of design and operating effectiveness) relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of a system or the confidentiality or privacy of information processed by a system that produces, manufac tures, or distributes products.  These changes, which have been reviewed by the ASEC chair, were made to provide greater flexibility for use of the trust services criteria in a SOC for Supply Chain examination. It is important to note that these changes do not alter in any way the trust services criteria used to evaluate controls in a SOC 2®, SOC 3®, or SOC for Cybersecurity examination.    fn 1 All BL sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards.  fn 2 All AT C sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards.  Page 3 For users who want to see all conforming changes made to this version of the trust services criteria, a red lined version is available at https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocu ments/trust services criteria redline 2019.pdf. Background .01 The AICPA Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) has developed a set of criteria (trust services criteria) to be used when evaluating the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems, or the confiden tiality or privacy of the information processed by the systems at an entity, a division, or an operating unit of an entity. In addition, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or pri vacy of a particular type of information processed by one or more of an entitys systems or one or more systems used to support a particular function within the entity. This document presents the trust services criteria. .02 As in any system of internal control, an entity faces risks that threaten its ability to achieve its objectives based on the trust services criteria. Such risks arise because of factors such as the following: • The nature of the entitys operations • The environment in which it operates • The types of information generated, used, or stored by the entity • The types of commitments made to customers and other third parties • Responsibilities entailed in operating and maintaining the entitys systems and processes • The technologies, connection types, and delivery channels used by the entity • The use of third parties (such as service providers and suppliers), who have access to the entitys system, to provide the entity with critical raw materials or components or operate controls that are necessary, in combination with the entitys controls, to achieve the systems objectives • Changes to the following: — System operations and related controls  — Processing volume  — Key management personnel of a business unit, supporting IT, or related personnel  — Legal and regulatory requirements with which the entity needs to comply  • Introduction of new services, products, or technologies An entity addresses these risks through the implementation of suitably designed controls that, if operat ing effectively, provide reasonable assurance of achieving the entitys objectives. Page 4 .03 Applying the trust services criteria in actual situations requires judgment. Therefore, in addition to the trust services criteria, this document presents points of focus for each criterion. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), in its Internal Control — Integrated Framework (the COSO framework), fn 3 states that points of focus represent important characteristics of the criteria. Consistent with the COSO framework, the points of focus in this document may assist management when designing, implementing, and operating controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. In addition, the points of focus may assist both management and the practi tioner when they are evaluating whether the controls were suitably designed and operated effectively to achieve the entitys objectives based on the trust services criteria. .04 Some points of focus may not be suitable or relevant to the entity or to the engagement to be performed. In such situations, management may customize a particular point of focus or identify and consider other characteristics based on the specific circumstances of the entity. Use of the trust services criteria does not require an assessment of whether each point of focus is addressed. Users are advised to consider the facts and circumstances of the entity and its environment in actual situations when applying the trust services criteria. Organization of the Trust Services Criteria .05 The trust services criteria presented in this document have been aligned to the 17 criteria (known as princi ples) presented in the COSO framework, which was revised in 2013. In addition to the 17 principles, the trust services criteria include additional criteria supplementing COSO principle 12: The entity deploys control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action (supplemental criteria). The supplemental criteria, which apply to the achievement of the entitys objectives relevant to a trust services engagement, are organized as follows: • Logical and physical access controls. The criteria relevant to how an entity restricts logical and physical access, provides and removes that access, and prevents unauthorized access • System operations. The criteria relevant to how an entity manages the operation of system(s) and detects and mitigates processing deviations, including logical and physical security deviations • Change management. The criteria relevant to how an entity identifies the need for changes, makes the changes using a controlled change management process, and prevents unauthorized changes from being made • Risk mitigation. The criteria relevant to how the entity identifies, selects, and develops risk miti gation activities arising from potential business disruptions and the use of vendors and business partners .06 In addition to the 17 principles in the COSO framework, certain of the supplemental criteria are shared amongst all the trust services categories (see the section Trust Services Categories). For example, the    fn 3 ©2019, Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). All rights reserved. See www.coso.org.  Page 5 criteria related to logical access apply to the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy categories. As a result, the trust services criteria consist of • criteria common to all five of the trust services categories (common criteria) and • additional specific criteria for the availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy categories. .07 The common criteria provide specific criteria for addressing the following: • The control environment (CC1 series) • Communication and information (CC2 series) • Risk assessment (CC3 series) • Monitoring of controls (CC4 series) • Control activities related to the design and implementation of controls (CC5 series) The common criteria are suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of controls to achieve an entitys sys tem objectives related to security; no additional control activity criteria are needed. For the categories of availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, a complete set of criteria consists of (a) the common criteria and (b) the control activity criteria applicable to the specific trust services category or categories addressed by the engagement. The criteria for each trust services category addressed by the engagement are considered complete only if all the criteria associated with that category are addressed by the engagement.  Trust Services Category Common Criteria Additional Category Specific Criteria Security X N/A Availability X X (A series) Processing Integrity (Over the Provision of Services or the Production, Manu facturing, or Distribution of Goods) X X (PI series) Confidentiality X X (C series) Privacy X X (P series) .08 The practitioner may report on any of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integ rity, confidentiality, or privacy, either individually or in combination with one or more of the other trust services categories. For each category addressed by the engagement, all criteria for that category are usually addressed. However, in limited circumstances, such as when the scope of the engagement is to report on a system and a particular criterion is not relevant to the services provided by a service organi zation, one or more criteria may not be applicable to the engagement. For example, when reporting on Page 6 privacy for a service organizations system, criterion P3.1, Personal information is collected consistent with the entitys objectives related to privacy, is not applicable for a service organization that does not directly collect personal information from data subjects. Trust Services Categories .09 The table in paragraph .24 presents the trust services criteria and the related points of focus. In that table, the trust services criteria are classified into the following categories: a. Security. Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access, unauthorized dis closure of information, and damage to systems that could compromise the availability, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information or systems and affect the entitys ability to achieve its objectives.  Security refers to the protection of i. information during its collection or creation, use, processing, transmission, and storage and  ii. systems that use electronic information to process, transmit or transfer, and store infor mation to enable the entity to meet its objectives. Controls over security prevent or detect the breakdown and circumvention of segregation of duties, system failure, incorrect pro cessing, theft or other unauthorized removal of information or system resources, misuse of software, and improper access to or use of, alteration, destruction, or disclosure of in formation. b. Availability. Information and systems are available for operation and use to meet the entitys ob jectives.  Availability refers to the accessibility of information used by the entitys systems as well as the products or services provided to its customers. The availability objective does not, in itself, set a minimum acceptable performance level; it does not address system functionality (the specific functions a system performs) or usability (the ability of users to apply system functions to the performance of specific tasks or problems). However, it does address whether systems include controls to support accessibility for operation, monitoring, and maintenance. c. Processing integrity (over the provision of services or the production, manufacturing, or distri bution of goods). System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to meet the entitys objectives.  Processing integrity refers to the completeness, validity, accuracy, timeliness, and authorization of system processing. Processing integrity addresses whether systems achieve the aim or purpose for which they exist and whether they perform their intended functions in an unimpaired manner, free from error, delay, omission, and unauthorized or inadvertent manipulation. Because of the number of systems used by an entity, processing integrity is usually only addressed at the system or functional level of an entity. In a SOC for Supply Chain examination, processing integrity re fers to whether processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to produce, manu facture, or distribute goods that meet the products specifications. Page 7 d. Confidentiality. Information designated as confidential is protected to meet the entitys objec tives.  Confidentiality addresses the entitys ability to protect information designated as confidential from its collection or creation through its final disposition and removal from the entitys control in accordance with managements objectives. Information is confidential if the custodian (for ex ample, an entity that holds or stores information) of the information is required to limit its access, use, and retention and restrict its disclosure to defined parties (including those who may other wise have authorized access within its system boundaries). Confidentiality requirements may be contained in laws or regulations or in contracts or agreements that contain commitments made to customers or others. The need for information to be confidential may arise for many different reasons. For example, the information may be proprietary, intended only for entity personnel.  Confidentiality is distinguished from privacy in that privacy applies only to personal infor mation, whereas confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive information. In addition, the privacy objective addresses requirements regarding collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information. Confidential information may include personal information as well as other information, such as trade secrets and intellectual property. e. Privacy. Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of to meet the entitys objectives.  Although confidentiality applies to various types of sensitive information, privacy applies only to personal information.  The privacy criteria are organized as follows: i. Notice and communication of objectives. The entity provides notice to data subjects about its objectives related to privacy. ii. Choice and consent. The entity communicates choices available regarding the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information to data subjects. iii. Collection. The entity collects personal information to meet its objectives related to pri vacy. iv. Use, retention, and disposal. The entity limits the use, retention, and disposal of personal information to meet its objectives related to privacy. v. Access. The entity provides data subjects with access to their personal information for re view and correction (including updates) to meet its objectives related to privacy. vi. Disclosure and notification. The entity discloses personal information, with the consent of the data subjects, to meet its objectives related to privacy. Notification of breaches and incidents is provided to affected data subjects, regulators, and others to meet its objec tives related to privacy. vii. Quality. The entity collects and maintains accurate, up to date, complete, and relevant personal information to meet its objectives related to privacy. Page 8 viii. Monitoring and enforcement. The entity monitors compliance to meet its objectives related to privacy, including procedures to address privacy related inquiries, complaints, and disputes. .10 As previously stated, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of infor mation and systems, or the confidentiality or privacy of the information processed by the entity. As such, they may be used when evaluating whether the entitys controls were effective to meet the criteria relevant to any of those categories (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or priva cy), either individually or in combination with controls in other categories. Application and Use of the Trust Services Criteria .11 The trust services criteria were designed to provide flexibility in application and use for a variety of differ ent subject matters. The following are the types of subject matters a practitioner may be engaged to re port on using the trust services criteria: • The effectiveness of controls within an entitys cybersecurity risk management program to achieve the entitys cybersecurity objectives using the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality as control criteria in a SOC for Cybersecurity examination. fn 4  • The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls included in managements de scription of a service organizations system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy throughout a specified period to achieve the entitys objectives based on those criteria in a type 2 SOC 2 engagement. A type 2 SOC 2 engagement, which includes an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls, also includes a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. A type 1 SOC 2 engagement addresses the same subject matter as a type 2 SOC 2 engagement; however, a type 1 SOC 2 report does not contain an opinion on the operat ing effectiveness of controls nor a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the ser vice auditor and the results of those tests. fn 5  • The design and operating effectiveness of a service organizations controls over a system rele vant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy in a SOC 3 engagement. A SOC 3 report contains an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls but does not include a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests.    fn 4 AICPA Guide Reporting on an Entitys Cybersecurity Risk Management Program and Controls (the cybersecurity guide) provides practitioners with performance and reporting guidance for a SOC for Cybersecurity examination.  fn 5 AICPA Guide SOC 2® Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization: Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, or Privacy, issued in 2018, contains performance and reporting guidance for SOC 2 examinations.  Page 9 • The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls of an entity, other than a service organization, over one or more systems relevant to one or more of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy (for example, a SOC for Supply Chain examination). • The suitability of the design of an entitys controls over security, availability, processing integri ty, confidentiality, or privacy to achieve the entitys objectives based on the related trust services criteria. fn 6  .12 Practitioners generally do not use the trust services criteria when engaged to report on an entitys compli ance, or on an entitys internal control over compliance with laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grant agreements. If the practitioner is engaged to report on compliance with laws, regulations, rules, con tracts, or grant agreements in connection with an examination of the design and operating effectiveness of an entitys controls (for example, in a privacy engagement performed in accordance with AT C sec tion 105 and AT Csection 205, Examination Engagements), the compliance portion of the engagement would be performed in accordance with AT C section 105 and AT C section 315, Compliance Attesta tion. .13 Many of the trust services criteria include the phrase to meet the entitys objectives. Because the trust ser vices criteria may be used to evaluate controls relevant to a variety of different subject matters (see par agraph .11) in a variety of different types of engagements (see paragraphs .20 .23), interpretation of that phrase depends upon the specific circumstances of the engagement. Therefore, when using the trust ser vices criteria, consideration is given to how the entitys objectives referred to in the criteria are affected by the subject matter and scope of the particular engagement. .14 For example, consider the following engagements: • In a SOC 2 engagement to examine and report on a service organizations controls over the secu rity, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system, management is re sponsible for meeting its commitments to customers. Therefore, the objectives in a SOC 2 en gagement relate to meeting its commitments to customers and system requirements. Commit ments are the declarations made by management to customers regarding the performance of one or more of the entitys systems. Such commitments generally are included in written contracts, service level agreements, or public statements (for example, a privacy notice). Some commit ments are applicable to all customers (baseline commitments), whereas others are designed to meet individual customer needs and result in the implementation of processes or controls, in ad dition to those required to meet the baseline commitments. System requirements refer to how the system should function to achieve the entitys commitments to customers, relevant laws and reg ulations, or guidelines of industry groups, such as trade or business associations.    fn 6 AT C section 9205, Examination Engagements: Attestation Interpretations of Section 205, addresses an engagement such as this in Interpretation No. 2, Reporting on the Design of Internal Control (AT C sec. 9205 par. .04 .14). That doc ument states that a practitioner may examine the suitability of the design of controls under AT C section 205, Examination Engagements. Paragraph .10 of AT C section 205 provides guidance on how a practitioner should report when the en gagement is over controls that have not yet been implemented.  Page 10 • In a SOC for Supply Chain engagement to examine and report on an entitys controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system used to pro duce, manufacture, or distribute products, management is responsible for establishing principal system objectives. Such objectives are embodied in the product commitments the entity makes to customers, including producing or manufacturing a product that meets product performance specifications and other production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. Commitments may also relate to other matters (for example, conforming with a variety of other standards and criteria such as the risk entity management framework issued by the National Institute of Stand ards and Technology, the cybersecurity standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization [ISO], or the Food and Drug Administration regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures included in Code of Federal Regulations, Electronic Records; Electron ic Signatures, Title 21, Part 11). • In an entity wide SOC for Cybersecurity examination, the entity establishes cybersecurity objec tives. Cybersecurity objectives are those that could be affected by cybersecurity risk and, there fore, affect the achievement of the entitys compliance, reporting, and operational objectives. The nature of an entitys cybersecurity objectives will vary depending on the environment in which the entity operates, the entitys mission and vision, the overall business objectives estab lished by management, and other factors. For example, a telecommunication entity may have a cybersecurity objective related to the reliable functioning of those aspects of its operations that are deemed to be critical infrastructure, whereas an online dating entity is likely to regard the privacy of the personal information collected from customers to be a critical factor in achieving its operating objectives. fn 7  .15 As an example of how the different subject matters and engagement scopes affect the use of the trust ser vices criteria, consider trust services criterion CC6.4: The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, da ta center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the entitys objectives. .16 In the SOC 2 engagement example discussed in paragraph .14, the phrase to meet the entitys objectives in CC6.4 usually would be interpreted as follows: The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, da ta center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the service organizations commitments and system requirements. .17 In addition, criterion CC6.4 would only be applied as it relates to controls over the trust services catego ry(ies) relevant to the system(s) included within the scope of the SOC 2 engagement.    fn 7 The practitioners responsibility is similar to that in AT C section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which requires the service auditor in a SOC 1® engagement to determine whether the control objectives stated in managements description of the service organizations system are reasonable in the circumstances.  Page 11 .18 In the SOC for Cybersecurity examination example in paragraph .14, the phrase to meet the entitys objec tives in CC6.4 usually would be interpreted as follows:  The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, da ta center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the entitys cybersecurity objectives. .19 In addition, criterion CC6.4 would be applied as it relates to controls within the cybersecurity risk manage ment program (a) across an entire entity; (b) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; (c) within a function relevant to the entitys operations, reporting, or compliance objectives; or (d) for a particular type of information used by the entity, depending on the scope of the SOC for Cybersecurity examina tion. Professional Standards Governing Engagements Using the Trust Services Criteria Attestation Engagements .20 Examination engagements and engagements to apply agreed upon procedures performed in accordance with the AICPA Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements fn 8 (SSAEs or attestation standards) may use the trust services criteria as the evaluation criteria. The attestation standards provide guidance on performing and reporting in connection with an examination, review, fn 9 and agreed upon procedures engagements. Under the attestation standards, the CPA performing an attestation engagement is known as a practitioner. In an examination engagement, the practitioner provides a report in which he or she expresses an opinion on subject matter or an assertion about the subject matter in relation to an identi fied set of criteria. In an agreed upon procedures engagement, the practitioner does not express an opin ion but, rather, performs procedures agreed upon by the specified parties and reports the results of those procedures. Examination engagements are performed in accordance with AT C sections 105 and 205; agreed upon procedures engagements are performed in accordance with AT C section 105 and AT C section 215, Agreed Upon Procedures Engagements. .21 According to the attestation standards, the criteria used in an attestation engagement should be suitable and available to report users. Attributes of suitable criteria are as follows: fn 10   fn 8 Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, is effective for practitioners reports dated on or after May 1, 2017.  fn 9 Paragraph .07 of AT C section 305, Prospective Financial Information, prohibits a practitioner from performing a re view of internal control; therefore, practitioners may not perform a review engagement in accordance with the attestation standards using the trust services criteria.  fn 10 Paragraph .25b of AT C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements.  Page 12 • Relevance. Criteria are relevant to the subject matter. • Objectivity. Criteria are free from bias. • Measurability. Criteria permit reasonably consistent measurements, qualitative or quantitative, of subject matter. • Completeness. Criteria are complete when subject matter prepared in accordance with them does not omit relevant factors that could reasonably be expected to affect decisions of the intended us ers made on the basis of that subject matter. .22 In addition to being suitable, AT C section 105 indicates that the criteria used in an attestation engagement must be available to users. The publication of the trust services criteria makes the criteria available to report users. Accordingly, ASEC has concluded that the trust services criteria are suitable criteria in ac cordance with the attestation standards. Consulting Engagements .23 Sometimes, the trust services criteria may be used in engagements that involve the performance of readiness services, in which a practitioner may assist management with the implementation of one or more new in formation systems within an organization. fn 11 Such engagements typically are performed under the consulting standards. In a consulting engagement, the practitioner develops findings and makes recom mendations for the consideration and use of management; the practitioner does not form a conclusion about or express an opinion on the subject matter of the engagement. Generally, consulting services are performed only for the use and benefit of the client. Practitioners providing such services follow CS sec tion 100, Consulting Services: Definitions and Standards. fn 12  Trust Services Criteria .24 The following table presents the trust services criteria and the related points of focus. In the table, criteria and related points of focus that come directly from the COSO framework are presented using a normal font. In contrast, supplemental criteria and points of focus that apply to engagements using the trust ser vices criteria are presented in italics. Finally, criteria and points of focus that apply only when engage ments using the trust services criteria are performed at a system level are presented in bold italics.    fn 11 When a practitioner provides information systems design, implementation, or integration services to an attest client, threats to the practitioners independence may exist. The Information Systems Design, Implementation, or Integration interpretation (ET sec. 1.295.145) of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, provides guidance to practitioners on evalu ating the effect of such threats to their independence.  All ET sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards.  fn 12 All CS sections can be found in AICPA Professional Standards.

52,Information Technology Industry Council,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128354-291122.pdf,"Promoting Innovation Worldwide  May 9, 2022  Re: ITI Comments on Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (RIN 3235 AM89; File Number S7 09 22)  The Information Technology Industry Council appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. ITI is the premier global advocate for technology, representing the worlds most innovative companies. Founded in 1916, ITI is an international trade association with a team of professionals on four continents. We promote public policies and industry standards that advance competition and innovation worldwide. Our diverse membership and expert staff provide policymakers the broadest perspective and thought leadership from technology, hardware, software, services, and related industries. Cybersecurity and cybersecurity technology are critical to ITI members. Facilitating the protection of our customers (including governments, businesses, and consumers), securing, and protecting the privacy of individuals data, and making our technology and innovations available to our customers to enable them to improve their businesses are core drivers for our companies. Consequently, ITI has been a leading voice in advocating effective approaches to cybersecurity, both domestically and globally. Cybersecurity is rightly a priority for governments and our industry, and we share the common goal of improving cybersecurity. Further, our members are global companies, doing business in countries around the world. Most service the global market via complex supply chains in which products are developed, made, and assembled in multiple countries around the world, servicing customers that typically span the full range of global industry sectors, such as banking and energy. We thus acutely understand the impact of governments policies on security innovation and the need for U.S. policies to be compatible with  and drive  global norms, as well as the potential impacts on our customers. As both producers and users of cybersecurity products and services, our members have extensive experience working with governments around the world on cybersecurity policy. In the technology industry, as well as banking, energy, and other global sectors, when discussing any cybersecurity policy, it is important to consider our connectedness, which is truly global and borderless. ITI supports the SECs intent to improve investors awareness of material cybersecurity incidents and believe that in many instances offering information about cybersecurity incidents and governance procedures can help to improve transparency. However, we also have concerns with the way the proposed rule is currently written, including the fact that it could lead to disclosure of unmitigated vulnerabilities and that it may precede and thus overlap with the CISA rulemaking to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA 2022). As a result, ITI urges the SEC to delay implementation of the proposed rule to provide the SEC and stakeholders the opportunity to work through these challenges and allow the SEC the time to coordinate with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to deconflict the proposed rule with the forthcoming regulations to implement CIRCIA 2022.  Below we offer perspectives on the proposed rule and respond to some of the specific questions posed. We structure our response to reflect 1) our overarching concerns related to the ways in   2 which this rule could serve to undermine cybersecurity, 2) our recommendation that the SEC delay implementation of the rule and work with CISA to streamline this measure with the implementation of the recently enacted CIRCIA 2022 to the extent possible, 3) our recommendation that the rule include safe harbor provisions for law enforcement, national security, and cybersecurity interests, 4) our view that the disclosure requirements undermine the relevance of materiality, 5) our view that the four business day post materiality determination disclosure window may serve to undermine cybersecurity and will not achieve the SECs objectives, 6) our recommendation that the SEC rule avoid requiring disclosure of incidents experienced by third party vendors, and 7) our views on the other proposed disclosures, including related to cyber risk management and governance processes.  I. The SECs proposed rule could result in the disclosure of Incidents prior to the mitigation of vulnerabilities, resulting in increased cybersecurity risks  In our view, which we believe is consistent with the Commissions intent, the resources and focus of incident reporting should first be on the technical realities of the incident response lifecycle from detection and analysis through recovery. ITI appreciates the proposed rules statement that the Commission does not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident.1 However, the rule also states in proposed Item 1.05, a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.2 ITI believes a tension exists between these two positions as it introduces the likelihood that registrants would have to publicly disclose incidents prior to the mitigation of vulnerabilities.  Proposed Item 1.05, as well as the SECs staff guidance back to 2011, fail to adequately take into account industry best practices and federal agency guidance on the handling of vulnerability disclosures.3 As the federal governments own coordinated disclosure program makes clear, public disclosure of unmitigated vulnerabilities increases cybersecurity risks. The U.S. General Services Administration states, we believe that disclosure [of vulnerabilities] in absence of a readily available patch tends to increase risk rather than reduce it, and so we request that you refrain from sharing your report with others while we work on our patch.4 Similarly, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has established a 5 step process for coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) the last of which is disclosure. CISA works with affected organizations to mitigate a vulnerability prior to disclosure.5 Finally, a 2016 Research Report from the National  1 SEC Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf.  2 SEC Proposed Rule, at 22. 3 CISA DHS BOD 20 01, and ISO/IEC 30111 (2019), 29147 (2018), endorsed there, and also by Congress, see the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.  4 U.S. General Services Administration, Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (website last visited Apr. 30, 2022) available at https://www.gsa.gov/vulnerability disclosure policy. 5 CISA Coordinated Vulnerability (CVD) Process (website lasted visited Apr. 30, 2022) available at https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated vulnerability disclosure process#:~:text=CISA%20Coordinated%20Vulnerability%20Disclosure%20(CVD,the%20affected%20vendor(s).  3 Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) found that efforts to improve communication between researchers and vendors should encourage more coordinated, rather than straight to public disclosure.6 The information communications and technology systems supply chain and ecosystem are deeply intertwined, making vulnerabilities and cyber threats potential risk factors for entities without association with one another. Indeed, requirements to disclose sensitive information concerning incidents, let alone vulnerability information, to the public at large stands in direct tension with existing federal guidance to maintain such information in confidence, and follow best practices and international standards for security and the handling of such information and incidents.7 CIRCIA 2022 also provides that any vulnerability information, to the extent it is provided as part of an incident report, shall be protected and handled based on practices consistent with international standards and industry best practices for the handling and disclosure of such information.8 These practices maintain that such information should be kept in strict confidence as its premature disclosure may enable attackers to harm end users and the ecosystem at large.  While the SEC, as noted above, does not expect technical information to be disclosed, it is difficult to envision a public disclosure with the information described in Proposed Item 1.05 for Form 8 K without describing information about the exploited vulnerability. The Commission lays out five new elements for the 8 K disclosure including a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident and the effect of the incident on the registrants operations.9 It will often be the case that registrants have to include information on specific technologies, vulnerabilities, or other technical information to explain the nature and scope of an incident or how that incident impacts registrants operations. For instance, in the SolarWinds Corporations December 17, 2020 (Commission File Number 001 38711) 8 K disclosure on their security incident describes vulnerabilities in its Orion monitoring products. Notably, SolarWinds Corporations 8 K disclosure came after hotfix updates to impacted customers were released to close the code vulnerability when implemented.10 As the SEC notes while discussing current disclosure practices of registrants, it is foreseeable and perhaps even predictable that malicious actors will adapt their strategies and target companies in any industry where there are perceived vulnerabilities.11 The public disclosure of unmitigated vulnerabilities will do just that, providing malicious actors with potentially valuable intelligence on which industries, companies, or vendors to target. We suggest that the Commission make it clear that the SEC will not require companies to submit Form 8 K disclosures until after the vulnerabilities at issue in a material incident have been mitigated.  Finally, we think it is important to highlight that in 2016 the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system suffered an intrusion exposing non public information to be filed on a  6 Vulnerability Disclosure Attitudes and Actions: A Research Report from the NTIA Awareness and Adoption Group. 7 See the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act and CIRCIA at 2245(a)(2)(E), as well as DHS CISA BOD 20 01.  8 See H.R. 2471 § 2245 (a)(2)(B). 9 SEC Proposed Rule, at 21. 10 SolarWinds Corp.

The SEC should delay implementation of this proposed rule and work with CISA to ensure federal coordination to the extent possible  In light of the fact that the CIRCIA f2022 was signed into law in March 2022, adding to an already complex cyber incident reporting landscape, we encourage the SEC to strive to coordinate  and align and deconflict as appropriate  the incident disclosure components of this proposed rule with CIRCIA and other existing sectoral measures. Indeed, to the extent that critical infrastructure owners/operators are also publicly traded companies, they would fall within scope of both that law and this proposed rule, adding further complexity to an already saturated landscape for those companies. Rather than prematurely adding another layer of conflicting and overlapping incident reporting regulations that will necessarily draw legal and cyber incident response resources from the labor intensive, fast paced, and time sensitive work of cyber incident response. We believe that it would be helpful for the SEC to first understand the direction that CISA is heading in with regard to the implementation of CIRCIA 2021, as understanding this context will help inform the direction the SEC takes in appropriately calibrating the proposed rule in a way that helps investors without harming cybersecurity. To be clear, we are not recommending that the SEC mandate the disclosure of all technical details included in an incident report to CISA, as that information would not be useful to investors and the public release of that information could serve to further undermine cybersecurity. Indeed, this is one of the reasons that CIRCIA 2022 provides confidentiality and liability protections for entities that are required to report significant cyber incidents to CISA. Additionally, every significant incident reported to CISA will not be material. However, the SEC should work with CISA to see whether there is certain high level information that overlaps between the two rules and whether reporting can be additionally streamlined to reduce the burden on companies that are subject to both rules. While we understand that the objectives of the SEC and CISA are different, we still believe it would be useful for the SEC to consider if and how to further streamline this disclosure requirement with that required by CIRCIA 2022. As an example, the definition of cyber incident and covered cyber incident may differ, further causing divergence between the two measures. The proposed rule defines cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Although aligned with the definition of cyber incident put forward in OMB M 17 12, the term ‘jeopardizes is concerning in this context, as many companies routinely have incidents that theoretically put data in jeopardy, but current reporting requirements generally require actual indications that data was lost and/or accessed. A mere vulnerability, without any evidence of exploitation, should not trigger disclosure requirements. As we reference above, not  12 Testimony of Chairman Jay Clayton, SEC, before the Committee on Financial Services in a hearing entitled Oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 21, 2018. Available at https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/testimony oversight us securities and exchange commission. 13 Ibid.  5 everything that is reportable to CISA will be reportable to SEC, given the fact that if an incident is not material, it will not be and should not be reportable under the proposed SEC disclosure regime. Beyond that, as CISA undertakes the rulemaking process to further define what constitutes a covered cyber incident for the purposes of the legislation, additional divergence may occur. To maintain consistency, then, we encourage the SEC to adopt the threshold definition of cyber incident as defined in CIRCIA 2022:  (A) at a minimum, require the occurrence of— (i) a cyber incident that leads to substantial loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information system or network, or a serious impact on the safety and resiliency of operational systems and processes; (ii) a disruption of business or industrial operations, including due to a denial of service attack, ransomware attack, or exploitation of a zero day vulnerability, against (I) an information system or network; or (II) an operational technology system or process; or (iii) unauthorized access or disruption of business or industrial operations due to loss of service facilitated through, or caused by, a compromise of a cloud service provider, managed service provider, or other third party data hosting provider or by a supply chain compromise. We also encourage the SEC to proactively engage with CISA as the SEC seeks to implement this proposed rule. Under CIRCIA 2022, referenced above, CISA is tasked with leading an interagency council focused on streamlining incident reporting requirements. This is a mechanism that could prove useful in deconflicting potential requirements and ensuring that a disclosure requirement does not inadvertently undermine cybersecurity. III. The SECs proposed rule should include safe harbor provisions for law enforcement, national security, and cybersecurity interests  The SECs rule will effectively pre empt most state disclosure laws, many of which permit companies to delay data breach notices when law enforcement determines that such notices will impede an investigation. The SECs proposed rules include no such exception, instead stating that [o]n balance, it is our current view that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors would justify not providing for a reporting delay.14 We encourage the SEC to reconsider this position and amend the proposed rule to allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident when there is an active law enforcement investigation underway or when it is in the interest of national security. While states take varying approaches to providing for such exceptions, the language included in Californias data breach law is illustrative: The notification required by this section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The notification required by this section shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that it will not compromise the investigation.15 14 SEC Proposed Rule, at 25. 15 See California Civil Code s. 1798.82, available here: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.82  6 We also note that question 7 of the proposed rule asks whether the rule should allow registrants to delay reporting a cyber incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay based on a written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security. As noted above, we support the inclusion of a safe harbor for a delay due to a national security interest. However, it is not clear how the structure proposed in the rule, where the Attorney General makes a written determination and requests a delay, would work in practice, particularly given it is uncertain whether sufficient information will be available to make such written determinations in a timely manner. This approach would have to be further contemplated, likely concurrently, by the DOJ in order for it to be implementable. Relatedly, the Commission should consider a safe harbor where the public disclosure of the incident would jeopardize remediation of the incident. A public disclosure of a material incident to the SEC runs the risk of tipping off an adversary with multiple footholds on a target network. As indicated by CISA in a 2020 Joint Advisory, depending on the nature of the compromise and sophistication of the adversary the best practice may be to continue uncovering malicious activity to ensure the threat actor has been eradicated from the victims network.16 Additionally, as argued above, public disclosures of unmitigated vulnerabilities not only pose a cybersecurity risk to the registrant, but also to other users of the vulnerable technology. We also encourage the SEC to consider a safe harbor that allows registrants to delay disclosure where disclosure would, in good faith, jeopardize the remediation of a cyber incident or places other entities at risk, prior to the mitigation or patch of a vulnerability being available.  IV. The SECs proposed cyber incident reporting requirements undermine the relevance of materiality and are unnecessary given its own substantial existing cybersecurity guidance As the SEC notes in the proposed rule, the materiality principle has been a foundational element of the disclosure requirements in the federal securities laws since they were adopted in the 1930s and has been fleshed out in a series of Supreme Court cases including TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, and Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano. Additionally, the SEC also points out that it has previously issued substantial interpretive guidance concerning the application of existing materiality driven disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws to cybersecurity risks and incidents, most notably in 2011 and 2018. However, the way the SEC proposes transforming that guidance into a set of new disclosure requirements related to cybersecurity incidents undermines the relevance of materiality in ways that will likely lead to the vast over disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, potentially doing more harm than good to the cybersecurity of registrants and confusing investors, contrary to the SECs intended purpose. While the SEC acknowledges in the proposed rule that materiality is an inherently subjective standard and that a materiality analysis is not a mechanical exercise, but rather must be driven by consideration all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the cybersecurity incident, several of the specific proposed incident reporting disclosure requirements  16 Joint Advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency entitled Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity (AA20 245A) originally released on Sept. 1, 2020. Available at https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20 245a.   7 are inconsistent with this well established approach and do not mesh well with the dynamic nature of cybersecurity incident response.  First, the proposed rule requiring the reporting of a series of previously immaterial cybersecurity incidents that, when analyzed retrospectively, have become material in the aggregate is unworkable. There are clearly many circumstances under which a cybersecurity incident would be immaterial to investors. The present cybersecurity reality as experienced by many large registrants is that they may experience hundreds or thousands of cybersecurity incidents, as defined in the proposed rule, every day. Notably, under the recently passed federal incident reporting law, CIRCIA, the large majority of such incidents will not be defined as significant to be considered as covered incidents so as to trigger reporting requirements, a practical approach which serves the cybersecurity purpose of spurring the sharing cybersecurity incident information to improve operational collaboration and recognizes that companies should not be required to devote limited incident response resources to reporting insignificant incidents. The SEC, however, has included a proposed requirement that registrants must disclose a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents [that] has become material in the aggregate, an approach that will likely lead to over disclosure of immaterial cybersecurity events, particularly amongst risk averse registrants. The securities laws require disclosure of all risks that the company believes are material at the time of disclosure  considering both risk and probability  not risks that are presently immaterial but are potentially material at some unknown point in the future when combined with immaterial risks that have yet to occur. When coupled with the requirement that registrants report any potential material future impacts, the aggregate reporting requirement creates just such an onerous, unbounded obligation continuous lookback over past immaterial incidents to draw inferences and relationships to determine aggregate materiality  requiring a level of public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents well beyond what is required to be confidentially disclosed to CISA under the new law. Rather than providing investors with useful information for informing investment decisions, the current approach, which provides open ended lookback periods and no aggregation criteria, will inundate investors with precisely the avalanche of trivial information the Supreme Court sought to avoid in Basic v. Levinson. We recommend that the proposed series/aggregate reporting requirement be eliminated entirely, or at a minimum, that the SEC include significantly more definitive guidance regarding how, under what circumstances, and over what period incidents are subject to this aggregation requirement Second, the proposed rule requires the disclosure of details regarding material cybersecurity incidents irrespective of the materiality of those specific details. On its face, the proposed rule requires details to be disclosed about cyber incidents that are not material. For example, the proposed modifications to Form 8 k require the disclosure of detailed categories of information (e.g., Whether any data was stolen or altered in connection with the incidents) irrespective of whether those details are themselves material. Whereas these types of details most certainly should be disclosed if they would be material to investors, there is no compelling rationale from a securities law standpoint or a cybersecurity standpoint for the SEC to include a prescriptive requirement that such details be disclosed in all cases. Further, because the nature of incident response is fast moving and ever evolving, companies are likely to over disclose information before fully having their arms around what is relevant (and before being 100% sure of the informations accuracy)  so this set of requirements will also result in the disclosure of an avalanche of trivial information.  8 We recommend, at a minimum, that the SEC clarify that any details it proposes to be disclosed regarding material incidents must also be individually qualified as material. Otherwise, registrants will expend resources reporting immaterial details regarding incidents that are not relevant or helpful to investors. Third, the proposed rules ongoing reporting requirements would require ongoing analysis of present incidents, as well as potential future impacts of both material incidents and immaterial cyber incidents. Under the SECs proposal registrants would need to devote resources to evaluating not only whether all cybersecurity incidents (including ongoing incidents) are material at present and any potential material future impacts on the registrants operations and financial condition, but also to continuously evaluate whether incidents previously determined to be immaterial may become material in the aggregate (as discussed above). The inevitable result of these ongoing review requirements is that companies will spend significant resources analyzing prior cyber incidents, including those deemed not to be material at the time, to assess whether there needs to be an updated disclosure. Requiring registrants to disclose information irrespective of whether it is material to investors, thus resulting in information overload and obscuring material information, is contrary to the SECs express rationale for the rule. We recommend that the SEC eliminate these onerous ongoing reporting requirements.  Finally, we believe the SEC does not provide a compelling justification for the rule. The proposed new incident disclosure requirements appear unnecessary, given the SEC in the proposed rule does not provide any compelling evidence that its existing guidance regarding cybersecurity disclosures is not currently being followed by registrants. Instead, the SEC offers as justification for the new proposed disclosure requirements anecdotal evidence that staff has observed certain cybersecurity incidents that were reported in the media but that were not disclosed in a registrants filings and that the cybersecurity disclosures that were made provide different levels of specificity regarding various details, or that the cybersecurity disclosures varied by the size and type of company. Rather than serving as a justification for the prescriptive requirements in the proposed rule, this stated rationale suggests that the SECs existing guidance is working, because each registrant should always be conducting an individualized, case by case analysis of whether a given cybersecurity incident it experiences is material  so it follows the disclosures, including the level of details and which companies are reporting them, should expectedly vary significantly. V. The SECs proposed four business days reporting timeline is unreasonable because it is likely to harm registrants cybersecurity and unlikely to yield useful information to investors  The SEC sets forth one of the reasons for the four business days post materiality determination timeline for its incident reporting requirement is to significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures. The SEC additionally cites as a rationale for the proposed rule the growing concern that material cybersecurity incidents are underreported, and that existing reporting may not be sufficiently timely. It is telling that the SEC offers citations from CISA cybersecurity officials and others who were referring to the need for new federal cybersecurity reporting requirements (since passed in a new law, CIRCIA), which would require disclosure of   9 significant incidents to CISA  not the public disclosure of potentially insignificant cyber incidents and details. While improving the timeliness of cyber incident disclosures makes sense from a cybersecurity perspective and has been addressed by the passage of the new law, imposing a four day post materiality determination disclosure requirement that does not allow for any delay or other accommodation for cybersecurity purposes does not make sense from a cybersecurity perspective or the perspective of investors, for several reasons. First, the four business days timeline proposed is unreasonable because a registrant can make a materiality determination and still be unlikely to have full, complete, and accurate information from the date of that determination. Requiring public disclosure within four business days of a materiality determination is too short of a timeline for imposing a blanket public disclosure requirement because in many cases a registrant will not have complete and accurate information necessary to make a disclosure useful (rather than misleading) to investors. Also, if a company must disclose early on in its investigation, the companys understanding of the incident may not be sufficiently nuanced and based on further investigation, the picture may change to be less severe, more severe, or just different, with varying degrees of negative cybersecurity impact. For example (1) the incident may look like it was caused by a certain type of attack (e.g., phishing) but further investigation may show credentials were stolen through a different attack method, (2) early on in an investigation, it may not be clear that something is important and/or sensitive so a company may disclose it based on a limited understanding, only to learn that the information is sensitive and should not have been disclosed once a fuller picture is established; (3) a threat actor could rapidly change their TTPs and pivot to a different attack vector/surface if information is disclosed on any remediation actions taken by the registrant; (4) an issuer might disclose that they have been subject to ransomware and/or made payment, and that information is later used by follow on ransomware attackers to target victims for repeat attacks. In all the above circumstances, registrants or other dependent organizations could suffer significant harm if such disclosures are forced to be made public prematurely or before corresponding customer or dependent entity notifications can be made. Second, a company may be able to determine that an incident is material at a stage when publicly reporting it would further compromise the companys security posture because it has not been adequately remediated. Not having exceptions for disclosures that reveal unremediated vulnerabilities would do more harm than good to investors because such disclosure may expose registrants to further incidents. Requiring disclosure of unremeditated incidents within four days would not enhance an investors ability to evaluate the companys management of cyber risks, but is potentially disastrous from a cybersecurity standpoint, and likely to do more harm than good to the value of investors investments in impacted registrants, because such disclosures may expose registrants to further incidents, compromise, or breach. While the SEC says it doesnt expect a registrant to disclose specific, technical information in such detail…that it would impede the registrants response or remediation, inevitably requiring companies to file Form 8 K on accelerated timelines would result in the disclosure of sensitive security related technical information, possibly including information that jeopardizes national security. The contents of the disclosure would include a description of the nature and scope of the incident, as well as the incidents impact on the registrants operations. Such disclosures could contain technically sensitive information on still unresolved vulnerabilities that could impact vendors or other users of that same vulnerable technology, potentially making the SEC disclosure a roadmap for other malicious actors. The uncertainty around the materiality standard, the   10 accelerated nature of the deadline and the potential liability attached to under disclosing are additional exacerbating factors. Ideally, as explored further in Section I of our paper, the SEC will modify the proposed disclosure requirements to clarify that information on unresolved vulnerabilities should be explicitly excluded from any public disclosures. At a minimum, the SEC should modify the rule to allow for a delay in reporting beyond four days to provide registrants with a reasonable opportunity to remediate active vulnerabilities. Third, as explored further in Section III, not allowing for exceptions to the four day reporting requirement for active law enforcement investigations puts registrants further at risk without sufficient corresponding benefits to investors. The information disclosed to the public on a material incident within four business days would not be complete and accurate information and could indeed be counterproductive if one of the goals is to improve cybersecurity practices amongst registrants. The SEC should provide an exception to the disclosure requirements during the pendency of an active law enforcement investigation into the incident, including to provide a safe harbor as discussed above.  VI. The SECs proposed rule should not require the disclosure of incidents experienced by third party technology vendors or service providers The SEC highlighted companies increasing reliance on third party service providers for information technology services… as one of the reasons cybersecurity risks have increased.17 As with the proposed rule for investment advisers and companies, the SECs proposed definition of information systems includes information resources owned or used by the registrant…In response to question 10, we encourage the SEC to consider the definition of information systems to include, information resources owned or controlled by registrants. Such a limitation would more accurately capture a registrants responsibilities over the cybersecurity incidents experienced on their systems and network. Alternatively, the SEC could include a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant. Registrants should only be required to disclose a cyber incident that happens on their own systems, not those of third party vendors or service providers. This is the case for a number of reasons. First, in the event of a cybersecurity incident at a third party vendor, public companies may have difficulty obtaining timely information to make a materiality determination for information systems they do not own or to provide sufficient details that would be required under the proposed rules. A third party vendors lack of responsiveness or slow response (both technically and in terms of information sharing) could also put companies at risk of violating this regulation through no fault of their own. Information often trickles in slowly as the vendors understanding of the incident evolves. Second, the third party vendor or service provider challenge also raises security concerns, as laid out in greater detail above. Under the current language of the proposed rule registrants would be in a position to publicly disclose information on unmitigated vulnerabilities or active threats against other potential victims and/or their own customers. Third, a disclosure on third party vendor or service provider incidents could also potentially run afoul of contractual obligations between the parties. As such, registrants should not be required to disclose unmitigated or ongoing  17 SEC Proposed Rule, at 7.  11 cybersecurity incidents. Finally, data centers, which are registrants, should have a safe harbor from 8 K disclosure of cyber incidents which merely pass through their physical or virtual infrastructure and attack a data center tenant. We propose that where the attack does not target or impact the services the data center is providing (e.g., connection to the Internet backbone, power, cooling), only the tenant/target should be required to assess the materiality of an incident and make a disclosure under the proposed rule.  VII. While we believe several of the proposed disclosure requirements related to cyber risk management processes will help to improve investors awareness, we also have concerns about the prescriptive nature of some of the disclosure requirements ITI recognizes that cybersecurity is an important part of corporate governance and there is value to investors in receiving information about a companys cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, their oversight of cybersecurity risks, and the board of directors cybersecurity expertise. Requiring increased transparency around cybersecurity risk management practices is important for shareholders to make informed decisions about their investments. Shareholders should have access to information about which public companies are effectively addressing the risks of the negative impacts of cyber security breaches. While we are generally supportive of the overarching disclosure requirements, we are concerned that the SECs proposed governance disclosure is a very detailed, one size fits all approach, which implies best practices that might not make operational sense for companies. But, as a result of requiring this type of disclosure, it is inevitable that companies will devote resources to making performative changes to their cybersecurity governance to fit with these disclosures and those that do not will open themselves up to unnecessary liability. Indeed, one could envision a scenario where a company suffers a cybersecurity incident and then has to deal with a nuisance Caremark lawsuit based on whether it did or did not comply with these best practices as dictated by the SEC, an agency that is not best positioned to be determining or setting these standards. Further, we are also concerned that requiring the public disclosure of specific, detailed information relating to cyber risk management programs and processes could provide a roadmap to malicious cyber actors who could use such information to identify vulnerabilities in registrants cyber defenses and tailor attacks accordingly. Even so, we appreciate that there is benefit to disclosing certain information to investors. Below we offer additional responses to the SECs questions to ensure the rule meets the SECs intent to provide decision useful information concerning whether and how a registrant is managing cybersecurity risks [which] could impact an investors return on investment while avoiding requiring disclosures of details that could undermine the cybersecurity defenses of the registrant.18  Question 17 of the proposed rule asks whether the SEC should adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed and whether there are other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed or excluded. ITI recommends that the SEC adopt (b)(i) and (b)(iv) of section 106(b) and (c), with the changes referenced below, and exclude proposed disclosures (b)(ii) b(iii), (b)(vi), b(vii), and b(viii), which we believe are too prescriptive and specific to disclose. 18 SEC Proposed Rule, at 11.  12  Item 106(b)(iv): We recommend merging sections (b)(iv) and (b)(v) into one disclosure that reads as follows: The registrant undertakes activities to prevent, detect, minimize [and/or respond to] the effects of cybersecurity incidents.  o We believe that both disclosures can be captured under one heading, as at a high level this reflects the basic structure of a cyber risk management program. We encourage the disclosure here to remain high level, allowing for flexibility in how companies choose to implement their cyber risk management programs.  Question 21 of the proposed rule asks whether a registrant should have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures.  We believe a registrant should be required to explicitly state if they have not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures. Cybersecurity breaches can damage a companys financial condition and have indirect consequences to the overall health of the company as well. If an organization does not have adequate cybersecurity controls and defenses, shareholders have a right to know and factor in that risk to their investment decisions. Question 22 of the proposed rule asks whether certain disclosures under Item 106 would have the potential to undermine a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity.  Item 106(b)(vi): We recommend the deletion of section 106(b)(vi): Previous cybersecurity incidents informed changes in the registrants governance, policies and procedures, or technologies. Providing this information could disclose details about how registrants are protecting their enterprise and therefore undermine the cybersecurity defenses of the registrant. Such detailed disclosure could have the unintended result of making the registrant more vulnerable to cyberattacks. In addition, we oppose requiring registrants to disclose a cyber incident before it has been mitigated. Otherwise, cybercriminals could target the registrant and other companies and their affected customers, employees, or other constituents. Question 23 of the proposed rule asks whether the SEC should exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs and how any exemption would impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants.  We do not think the SEC should exempt any categories of registrants from proposed Item 106(b), including smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs. All organizations are potential targets by threat actors, who typically cast a wide net and are indiscriminate in their threat activities. Further, it is often smaller organizations that have implemented the weakest cybersecurity defenses and are least mature in their basic cyber hygiene protections, such as regularly patching software, ensuring devices are properly configured, using multi factor authentication, and enforcing least privileges to systems and   13 data. Increased transparency with respect to companies cybersecurity risk management is valuable to investors when making investment decisions, regardless of filer type.  Question 24 asks whether the SEC should provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or ABS issuers. While we believe an overall delay in implementation of the SEC rule is warranted, we do not think the SEC should significantly delay compliance with Item 106 provisions based on the category of registrant, but instead provide for a period of transition for compliance. Cybersecurity risk assessment programs should be a foundational and strategic function of all organizations, no matter the age, size, or industry. A decision to delay compliance would signal that cybersecurity risk assessment is only relevant to specific segments of companies, when the reality is that all organizations are potential targets by threat actors. It is to the benefit of companies, their customers, and their shareholders to ensure that adequate cybersecurity controls and defenses are implemented without exception or the ability to skirt compliance due to a technicality. Question 25 30 ask about disclosures related to the board of directors cyber expertise. While we agree there is some value in informing investors about whether a registrants board of directors has an oversight role regarding cybersecurity, including an oversight role regarding registrants cybersecurity risk management practices, we have several concerns with this disclosure. We believe that such disclosures could serve to unnecessarily influence the composition of the board of directors, as publicly traded companies will try to fill board seats in order to align with the disclosure requirement to avoid appearing that they do not take cybersecurity as seriously as other companies.19 In this vein, we think it important to emphasize that there is currently a significant shortage of cybersecurity talent. While companies may want to fill seats with candidates that have cyber expertise to align with the proposed disclosure requirements, there is unlikely a robust enough set of candidates that have cybersecurity expertise and are also qualified to hold a seat on the board of directors. So, it will be effectively impossible for all publicly traded companies to fill their board of directors with candidates that have cyber expertise. Additionally, larger public companies may be able to offer better incentives to those individuals with cyber expertise, putting smaller public companies at a disadvantage in terms of attracting and retaining those individuals. In general, ITI believes that some of the disclosures specified in Item 106 regarding a registrants policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, a registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks, and managements role and relevant expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies would be beneficial in promoting transparency.  ***  We appreciate the opportunity to share our perspective with the SEC. While we understand the objectives of the rule are to improve investor awareness of cybersecurity related factors, we are concerned that it may in fact serve to undermine cybersecurity if not appropriately calibrated. We  19 See Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Pierce here: https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery  14 encourage the SEC to delay implementation of the proposed rule until CISA has further implemented its own rulemaking pursuant to CIRCIA 2021, so as to have a more fulsome understanding of the cyber incident reporting landscape. We are always happy to discuss our views further.",3
53,"Vincent J. Morales, PPG Industries, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128345-291106.pdf,"May 9, 2022 Page 2 these steps are taken that an issuer will be able to determine whether the incident is material. It may take several days for an issuer to determine if the incident is still ongoing, how to mitigate the incident and if sensitive information was stolen, and if so, how much.  Requiring a Form 8 K filing within four business days of the determination of materiality could lead to a number of misleading false positives, as issuers may feel the need to file a Form 8 K before they have had a chance to fully assess the severity of the incident.  Because the Proposed Rules state that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident,1 issuers will be required to make a materiality determination at the same time that they are actively repelling an attack. For example, a retailer learns that its customer credit card database was accessed by an unauthorized party, which appears on its face to be material, so the retailer files a Form 8 K. But after several days, the retailer determines that unauthorized party did not download customers credit card information. Arguably, this incident only would have been material if the credit card numbers were stolen, but because that appeared to be the case at first, the Form 8 K filed to report the incident likely caused unnecessary harm to the company, its reputation and its stock price. Moreover, reporting within four business days could hinder the response to the incident.  For example, a perpetrator targeting many companies could use certain targets as a test to see if they discover the attack within four business days, and if so, change tactics, regardless of the level of detail required in the Form 8 K. In addition, PPG believes that delaying a Form 8 K during the time an active law enforcement investigation regarding the incident is underway or if requested by the Attorney General is warranted, as the premature disclosure could tip off the perpetrator and render an investigation ineffective.  Providing issuers with the flexibility to respond to the incident before making a public disclosure would better protect the issuer, other companies and investors.  B. The Commission should adopt a more principles based approach to risk management disclosure.  Proposed Item 106(b) of Regulation S K solicits a level of detail that could provide a potential bad actor with information that could endanger the issuer. In its 2018 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, the Commission stated that a company need not make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts—for example, by providing a ‘roadmap for those who seek to penetrate a companys security protections.2 However, PPG is concerned that the disclosures required by proposed Item 106(b) could provide just such a roadmap. PPG supports disclosure of principles based information about issuers cybersecurity governance and risk mitigation activities, but PPG believes that the prescriptive requirements of Item 106(b) could put companies at risk. Principles based disclosures can provide significant information to investors about the issuers cybersecurity governance framework and risk mitigation actions without compromising the issuers security.  1 File No. S7 09 22: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure at p. 22. 2 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 83 Fed. Reg. 8166 (26 February 2018). Release Nos. 33 10459, 34 82746.  May 9, 2022 Page 3 C. Issuers should not be required to disclose the existence of a cybersecurity expert on the Board of Directors.  Principles based disclosure about an issuers cybersecurity risk governance should be sufficient for investors to determine if the issuer has appropriate risk management oversight in place. The requirement to disclose whether the issuer has a cybersecurity expert on the Board of Directors could evolve into a market expectation that all issuers have an expert on their Board. PPG does not believe that the Commissions disclosure rules should be a de facto governance requirement. Thousands of companies would become subject to this requirement simultaneously, many of which would need to add a new director to their Board. To meet this requirement, issuers may have to create a new seat on the Board solely for a cybersecurity expert. Unlike the experience necessary to be an audit committee financial expert, the requirements of proposed Item 407(j) are so specific that there likely is not a large pool of director candidates with this level of expertise who also have the general leadership and business experience to serve as a director of a public company. Directors can gain expertise on cybersecurity (or many other company risks) through educational opportunities, table top exercises and from the issuers own cybersecurity team. Issuers would be better served having a cybersecurity expert with the qualifications set forth in proposed Item 407(j) on their management team, rather than on the Board. PPG appreciates this opportunity to provide feedback and our perspectives on the Proposed Rules. For the reasons set forth above and those in the comment letters submitted by the National Association of Manufacturers, the New York Stock Exchange and other manufacturers, PPG respectfully requests that the Commission consider these comments when formulating the final cybersecurity disclosure rules.

My name is Rocio Baeza. I am a working professional, wife, mom to 2, and a data privacy advocate. I am the CEO and Founder of CyberSecurityBase, a Chicago based consultancy that specializes in the small dollar lending space, helping Legal and Compliance Executives with information security and compliance initiatives. Our professional services include serving as our clients outsourced security and compliance team, developing and implementing a customized set of information security1 policies and procedures, performing audits, conducting gap assessment, and/or providing SOC2 readiness support. After graduating with a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Chicago, I started my professional career at CashNetUSA. CashNetUSA was a rising payday lender that grew into what is now known as Enova International, a publicly traded company with an international presence in the financial services and data analytics space. While employed at Enova, I supported recognizable brands, including Cash America, NetCredit, QuickQuid, Pounds to Pocket, and Enova Decisions. My professional background provides me with a unique perspective that I seek to share, to educate regulators, influence regulation and guidance from agencies that regulate the financial services industry. The end goal is to ensure that regulations protect the everyday American consumer from negative impact resulting from inadequate protection of personal information processed by the financial services industry. This is congruent with the SECs mission to protect Main Street investors and others that rely on the markets to secure their financial future. Since my time at Enova, I have supported clients on a consultant basis, spoken at professional trade events, and voiced concerns with the current state of the cybersecurity field to regulators. At the local level, this includes assessing data security measures for the Chicago CityKey ID (a government issued ID card for Chicagoans). 1 Note that the terms information security, security, and cybersecurity are used interchangeably and have the same meaning: the protection of data that is available in a digital format 1 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 At the federal level, this includes providing commentary to the proposed changes to the GLBAs Safeguards Rule, participating in the FTCs Safeguards Rule Virtual Workshop in July 2020. In 2021, I submitted commentary to additional areas, including the CFPBs Section 1033  Consumer Access to Financial Records Proposed Rule and Request for Information and Comment on Financial Institutions Use of Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, My work experience includes roles in various key roles, including data analytics, product management, IT risk management, cybersecurity, and compliance. Combined with my early journey as a CEO, I have a unique perspective that can provide insights that will help the SEC in finalizing the proposed rules. As it relates to enhanced and standardized disclosure on the registrants cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, the proposed amendments are too subjective. If implemented as described, my concern is that they will create a significant reporting burden to registrants and provide no meaningful information for an investor that wants to understand a registrants cybersecurity risk management capabilities. In the following paragraphs, I will illustrate what I mean and then follow with recommendations for a more effective approach. The SEC is considering amending Form 10 K to require disclosure of a registrants policies and procedures, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. As worded, the proposed amendment implies that a registrant is able to identify and manage cybersecurity risks with the mere existence of policy and procedures. This is incorrect. An organization needs to establish a number of foundational elements before it can assess cybersecurity risks. We stress the importance of these foundational elements, when developing and implementing cybersecurity programs with our clients. These include: ● data inventory: this clarifies the data held by the organization ● data flow diagram: this illustrates how the organization receives data and where it flows after it in its possession ● IT asset inventory: this tracks where the organization processes and/or stores data ● 3rd party vendor inventory: this tracks the parties that exchange data with the organization ● data security and privacy requirements inventory: this tracks laws, regulations, standards, and/or frameworks that the organization is required to follow (or has made commitments to follow) ● cybersecurity vision: this clarifies the results that the organization desires from its cybersecurity program 2 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 ● cybersecurity risk tolerance: this defines what is acceptable and what is not Only after this information has been gathered, can an organization start the process of assessing cybersecurity risks. I urge the SEC to consider amending Form 10 K to require that the registrant disclose the following information with the following structure. Disclosure Item Response Data Inventory Does the registrant have a data inventory? The data inventory is a record of the data held by the registrant and serves as the authoritative data inventory. _Yes _ No Has the data inventory been reviewed within the last 90 days? _Yes _ No Will the data inventory be reviewed and updated in the next 90 days? _Yes _ No Data Flow Diagram Does the registrant have a documented data flow diagram? The data flow diagram is a visual illustration that demonstrates how the registrant receives data and where it flows once it is in its possession. This data flow diagram must serve as the authoritative data inventory _Yes _ No Has the documented data flow diagram been reviewed within the last 90 days? _Yes _ No Will the documented data flow diagram be reviewed and updated in the next 90 days? _Yes _ No IT Asset Inventory Does the registrant have a documented IT asset inventory? The IT asset inventory is an inventory of all systems and/or services (in house or external) that processes and/or stores data in its possession. This IT asset inventory must serve as the authoritative data inventory _Yes _ No Has the documented IT asset inventory been reviewed within the last 90 days? _Yes _ No Will the documented IT asset inventory be reviewed and updated in the next 90 days? _Yes _ No 3 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 3rd Party Vendor Inventory Does the registrant have a documented 3rd party vendor inventory? The 3rd party inventory is a record of all external parties that provides a service to the registrant and indicates the type of data that is exchanged. This 3rd party vendor inventory must serve as the authoritative data inventory _Yes _ No Has the documented 3rd party vendor inventory been reviewed within the last 90 days? _Yes _ No Will the documented 3rd party vendor inventory be reviewed and updated in the next 90 days? _Yes _ No Data Security and Privacy Requirements Inventory Does the registrant have a data security and privacy requirements inventory? The data security and privacy requirements inventory is a record of all laws, regulations, standards, and/or frameworks that the registrant is required to follow (or has made commitments to follow) _Yes _ No Has the data security and privacy requirements inventory been reviewed within the last 6 months? _Yes _ No Will the data security and privacy requirements inventory be reviewed and updated in the next 90 days? _Yes _ No Cybersecurity Vision Does the registrant have a documented cybersecurity vision that has been presented to the Board of Directors? The cybersecurity vision describes the results that the registrant desires from its cybersecurity program. It must have been presented to the Board of Directors _Yes _ No Has the cybersecurity vision been reviewed within the last 12 month period? _Yes _ No Will the cybersecurity vision be reviewed and updated within the next 12 months? _Yes _ No Cybersecurity Risk Tolerance Does the registrant have a documented cybersecurity risk tolerance that has been presented to the Board of Directors? The cybersecurity risk tolerance defines thresholds for behavior, activity, or events that are acceptable (and those that are not) _Yes _ No 4 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 Has the documented cybersecurity risk tolerance been reviewed within the last 12 month period? _Yes _ No Will the documented cybersecurity risk tolerance be reviewed and updated within the next 12 months? _Yes _ No Requiring these disclosures in this format, accomplishes the following: ● It educates registrants of the foundational elements that an effective cybersecurity risk management program requires; These foundational elements are the equivalent of bookkeeping in the field of Accounting ● It removes the subjectivity of the disclosure, and provides clear information to the investor; The existence of a policy or procedure is not useful information for an investor; An investor benefits in knowing if the registrant has a good understanding of the data held, the location of data processing and storage systems, the flows of data, and digital boundaries of the registrants ● It communicates the Boards familiarity with the registrants cybersecurity vision and risk tolerance; The investor benefits in knowing if the registrant has articulated regulatory and stakeholder requirements, vision, and risk tolerance levels and communicated all this information to the Board of Directors ● Most important, it democratizes the concepts needed by organizations that do not have a Chief Information Security Officer; This clarifies the foundational elements that a non experienced security owner needs to be aware of, to help its organization identify and manage cybersecurity risks Having supported online lenders with 3rd party due diligence programs (also known as vendor management programs), and being on both sides of the diligence conversation, I am confident that this reporting format and structure will meet the goals of the proposed rules2. In my experience, asking contextual and specific questions are a more effective way of gathering meaningful information. As proposed, the administrative cost to meet the proposed requirements are greater than the value of the information made available by the proposed disclosures. The SEC is considering amending Form 10 K to require disclosing whether the registrant considers cybersecurity as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation. As worded, the proposed disclosure may encourage registrants to find creative ways to answer yes to this question. A serious executive would never dare to imply that they are running an organization that does not include cybersecurity considerations. Our team has personally 2 Better inform investors about a registrants risk management, strategy, and governance and to provide timely notification of material cybersecurity incidents. 5 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 witnessed this, in advising our clients in cybersecurity and compliance topics during the due diligence phase of a partnership with a US bank. I urge the SEC to consider amending Form 10 K to require that the registrant disclose this information in the following structure and format: Cybersecurity Considerations in Business Strategy Does the registrant have a documented cybersecurity vision that takes into account: the interests of the Board of Directors? _Yes _ No the interests of investors? _Yes _ No the interests of its customer base? _Yes _ No Cybersecurity Considerations in Financial Planning In reviewing the spend for the past 12 months, did the registrant allocate at least 3% of its annual spend to support cybersecurity risk management? (A note for the SEC: The percentage is arbitrary. It is meant to provide some objectivity to the question.) _Yes _ No Has the registrant allocated at least 3% of its budget, for the current budget period? (A note for the SEC: The percentage is arbitrary. It is meant to provide some objectivity to the question.) _Yes _ No Requiring these disclosures in this format, accomplishes the following: ● it removes the subjectivity of the disclosure, and provides clear information for the investor; this clarifies if the registrants cybersecurity vision takes into account the interests of all key stakeholders or only some; The affirmative confirmation to cybersecurity considerations to strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation is not useful information for an investor; An investor benefits in knowing specifics about these areas ● it communicates the resources that the registrant has made available for managing cybersecurity risks in the last 12 month period and the current budget period The SEC is considering amending Form 10 K to require disclosure specified in proposed Item 106 regarding: ● A registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks 6 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 As worded, it is suggested that the proposed disclosure will be an open ended question. Assuming that this is true, this creates a low bar for the registrant to report that the Board is involved at a greater capacity than it actually is. I urge the SEC to consider amending Form 10 K to require that the registrant disclose this information in the following structure and format: Board Oversight Regarding CyberSecurity Risks Has the registrant presented the Board of Directors with results of a security risk assessment performed in the last 12 months? _Yes _ No Has the registrant presented the Board of Directors with remediation plans and progress updates for the top 3 cybersecurity risks? _Yes _ No Has the registrant updated the security risk register to capture the remediation plans and progress updates for the top 3 cybersecurity risks? _Yes _ No Has the registrant made the security risk register available in its entirety to the Board of Directors for awareness and review? _Yes _ No Requiring these disclosures in this format, accomplishes the following: ● it provides registrants with a roadmap for communicating cybersecurity risks to the Board; Historically, cybersecurity reporting has been challenging, because of the translation that the security owner needs to do when discussing cybersecurity with business minded executives ● it provides investors with clarity on specific actions that have been carried out to keep the Board informed on cybersecurity risks The SEC is considering amending Form 10 K to require disclosure specified in proposed Item 106 regarding: ● Managements role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies. As worded, it is suggested that the proposed disclosure will be an open ended question. Assuming that this is true, this creates a low bar for the registrant to report that Management plays an active role and has relevant expertise in managing cybersecurity risks as described. I urge the SEC to consider amending Form 10 K to require that the registrant disclose this information in the following structure and format: Management Role and Experience in Managing CyberSecurity Risks 7 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 Has the registrant performed a security risk assessment within the last 12 months and that is documented? _Yes _ No Does the security risk assessment capture the criteria used for the evaluation and categorization of identified security risk or threats faced by the registrant?3: _Yes _ No In the last 12 months, has the registrant assessed at least 80%4 of its IT assets, to measure compliance to the documented security policy requirements? In other words, has management set the expectation that the documented security policy requirements are to be applied to all IT assets? Or only specific IT assets? _Yes _ No In the last 12 months, has the registrant communicated to the Board the percentage of IT assets that have been assessed for compliance to the documented security policy requirements? _Yes _ No Currently, does the registrant have a set of documented procedures that align to the documented security policy requirements and reflect current practices being performed by the registrant? _Yes _ No In the last 12 months, has the registrant communicated to the Board the percentage of security policy requirements that are not supported by documented procedures (or do not align to current practices being performed by the registrant)? _Yes _ No Does the registrant affirm that the security policy and procedures align to the letter and substance of the published Privacy Policy (or Privacy Notice)? _Yes _ No Requiring these disclosures in this format, accomplishes the following: ● it introduces standardization and rigor to the security risk assessment process; This is important, as the cybersecurity industry has not yet matured to have an established standard for assessing security risk; this creates a disadvantage for the registrant that relies on external support and may not have the skillset to determine if a service provider is providing a quality security risk assessment ● it provides Management and the Board with visibility on the efforts around implementing and operationalizing security policy at the IT system level; Historically, the cybersecurity industry has failed in providing meaningful reporting to C level executives and the Board. This can be remedied by guiding Management on the importance of delivering customized security reporting that is contextualized to the IT systems that support the business 4 80% is an arbitrary figure; The goal here is that this metric be quantifiable; 3 Note that this aligns to the 2021 update to GLBAs Safeguards Rule (314.3 Standards for safeguarding customer information) 8 of 9 Comments to the SECs Proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22 ● it provides Management and the Board with visibility on the compliance levels for its IT systems; Historically, the cybersecurity industry has failed in providing meaningful reporting to C level executives and the Board. This can be remedied by guiding Management on the importance of delivering customized security reporting that is contextualized to the IT systems that support the business ● it clarifies to Management that a documented policy is not sufficient to manage cybersecurity risks; When regulations start by requiring security policy, it tends to shift the focus away from meaningful activity to administrative activity that comes off as robust, but ineffective, because of the lack of focus placed on operationalizing supporting procedures across the data processing environment level ● it sets the expectation that the Privacy Policy (also known as a Privacy Notice) that is public facing, needs to align to the information security policy, which is directed to internal teams; This is a gap that has been created because of the misalignment between legal and security industries, that can start to be remedied with the proposed rules In closing, I appreciate the invitation to provide comments on the proposed Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure by Public Companies. This is an important matter, as it impacts institutional and everyday investors. Please consider this information and these recommendations as you finalize the rules.

Because of these concerns we urge the Commission to rescind its proposal in its cmTent fonn. Founded in 1919, the National Restaurant Association (the Association) is the leading business association for the restaurant and foodse1vice industty, representing more than 14.5 million employees, nearly 10 percent of the nations workforce. As the nations second largest p1ivate sector employer, with nearly one million locations across the country, the restaurant industty is a vital driver of the U.S. economy. While 90% of restaurants across the countty have less than 50 total staff, restaurants of all cuisines and sizes routinely safeguard their most valuable assets. Whether it is putting cash and receipts in a register or safe, maintaining the highest standards when selecting, storing, and prepa1ing food, or providing a safe and secure environment for customers and employees alike, protection is a priority for restaurant operators. Seeming our customers personal infmmation is no different operators work tirelessly to strengthen their cyber defenses to help avoid being victimized by threat actors because they recognize that data security is crncial to a restaurants success in todays digital economy.

Harmonization of Potentially Duplicative or Conflicting Requirements Between Cyber Incident Reporting for Clitical Infrastrncture Act (CIRCIA), Other Data Breach Laws, and SECs Proposed Rules Earlier this year, as part of the $1.1 ttillion spending package, Congress passed the Cybersecmity Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastmcture Act (CIRCIA), which requires companies deemed to fall within a critical infrastmcture sector to notify the Cybersecmity and Critical Infrastructure Agency (CISA) within 72 hours of a significant cyber incident and, in the case of ransom ware, provide notification within 24 hours of making a payment.2 The Association believes that CIRCIA represents an important step 1 SECs Cybersecurity Risk Management. Strategy.

Washing ton, DC 20036 11 towards increasing federal government oversight of data security incidents, especially in the wake of last years Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nations Cybersecurity, and the potential implications for American businesses resulting from the ongoing Russia Ukraine conflict. However, CIR.CIA does not identify which of the critical infrast:rncture sectms will be considered covered entities, nm does it specify what will be considered a covered cyber incident under the law these key definitions will be finalized as pait of CISA s mlemaking process scheduled to take place over the course of the next two years.3 Until these definitions cai1 be agreed upon, the Association believes it will be challenging for the SEC to hannonize the potentially duplicative and/or conflicting repo1ting requirements between CIR.CIA and its own proposal. In addition to general ambiguities surrounding CIR.CIA, companies must a.heady comply with a wide airay data breach ai1d security incident repo1ting obligations at both the state and federal levels. Restaurants across the countly are cunently obligated to report cyber related incidents under the Health Insurance Pmtability and Accountability Act (HIP AA) and the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as well as comply with data breach laws in all 50 states. TI1ese vaiying state laws often contain different requirements for determining whether a breach has occmTed and for tl1e notices that are required, meaning that businesses must consider the scope of the data they collect and store in ordeI to determine whether they ai·e likely to have obligations to repmt m1der the laws of a given state. , ,4 In many cases, these state laws impose vaiying obligations for how ai1d when to notify the identified individuals, Attorneys General offices, and relevant Credit Repo1ting Agencies. While tl1e SEC appears to acknowledge that companies may need to comply with many data b1each disclosure requirements . [that] may coveI some of the material incidents that companies would need to rep01t m1de1 the proposed amendments, but not all incidents, 5 we believe the Commission does not fully appreciate how its proposed mles would ftnther strain restaurants and otheI businesses limited resources to def end against malicious cyber attacks while complying with the multin1de of federal and state laws a.heady on the books. Therefore, the Association urges the Commission to more clearly stipulate how it intends to harmonize this myriad of cybersecmity rep01ting regulations affecting the business community at all levels of government. II. Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K Within 4 Business Days Under its proposed mles, the Commission would amend Form 8 K to add Item 1. 05 to requi1e a company to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within 4 business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecmity incident. The SEC ai·gues that such 1epo1ting would significantly improve the timeliness of cybe1security incident disclosures, as well as provide investms with more standardized and comparable disclosures. 6 While we appreciate the Commissions desiie to collect more data from industty regarding the nature of the cyber tlueats they endure, the proposed 4 day notification timeline would be sho1ter than nearly all cmTently applicable data breach laws that restaurants ClUTently comply with. As mentioned previously, CIRCIA provides a 72 hour notification regime but has not yet come into effect, while most states do not specify an exact timeframe for rep01ting a cyber related incident those that do generally prescribe a 30 45 day timeline for notification to a combination of affected individuals, Attorneys General offices, and other key repo1ting and law enfo1cement agencies. In addition to this lack of harmonization, the Association is concerned tl1at the Commissions proposed 4 day reporting timeframe could imperil a restaurants cyber risk management strategy. Often there are 3 Consolidated Approp,iations Act, 2022 4 https://www.bmT.com/2021112/10/ data breach notification laws in the united states what is required and how is that determined/ 5 SEC Proposed Rules 6 SEC Proposed Rules Enhancing the quality of life for all we serve Restaurant.org I ~ WeRRestaurants 2055 L Street NW, Suite 700, Washing ton, DC 20036 I conflicting and competing priorities early in a cyber incident, and for restaurants and many other businesses, it is colillilon for an incident response plan to take several weeks to determine when the incident was discovered; whether it is ongoing; whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose; the overall effect of the incident on the companys operations; and whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. Even witl1 a pe1fectly operating team following a well constmcted incident Iesponse plan, a restaurant would be extremely haid piessed to meet the Ieporting requirements outlined in the Commissions proposed mles while also fulfilling the plethora of legal obligations at the state and federal levels. Perhaps the most important aspect of a companys incident response plan is their engagement with law enforcement, and the Commissions proposed 4 day disclosme framework could prove detrimental to these agencies ability to conduct a thorough forensic investigation. The prematme and public disclosure of relevant infonnation to the SEC could cause the victim company to accidentally delete or destroy evidence critical to an investigation, as well as jeopardize law enforcements ability to monitor fuither malicious activities. Rapid disclosure also decreases the chance of recovering stolen fuiids, the Iemediation of cryptogrnphic lockers, or the detection of malicious networks, and the Association believes that it is faI more impmtant for restaurants to make approp1iate and confidential disclosures to law enforcement than to make piemature and uninfmmative disclosmes to shareholders and potential investors. III. Disclosure Regarding Material Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports Furtl1er complicating this 4 day repmting Iequirement is how the Commission defines the materiality of a cyber incident. UndeI the proposed mles, an incident would be deemed mate1ial if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consideI this infonnation important in making an investment decision, or if it would have significantly altered the total mix of infmmation available to the investor.7 Additionally, the Commissions proposed addition ofltem 106(d)(2) would require a company to disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immate1ial cybersecmity incidents become material in the aggregate. The SEC says that registrants would be mandated to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both individually and in the aggregate.8 Unf01tm1ately, these mate1iality dete1minations outlined in the Cmmnissions proposed mles will likely prove challenging for companies to make in a calculated and responsible way, especially while forensic investigations are ongoing, and all the relevant facts have not yet come to light. In fact, many of the examples provided in the proposed mles are cybersecurity incidents that may happen with frequency in todays cybe1threat environment despite reasonable infonnation security programs and defenses and that could vaiy in degree of impact from the trivial to the mate1ial, depending on the specific facts of the pa1ticular incident. The proposed rules do not provide substantially greater clarity from prior guidance for when an incident crosses the materiality threshold.,<) The fact that the trigger date for the disclosure requirement is the same date that the materiality determination must be made does not provide companies with enough flexibility given the mles expectation that a business should make this determination as soon as reasonably prncticable after discove1y of the incident. A pa1ticulai·ly impractical suggestion in the proposed rule is that disclosure must occur when individually ilillilaterial incidents become matelial in tl1e aggregate. 10 The SEC made clear that materiality would be dete1mined with reference to existing case law, but the Association is unaware of strong, cleai· case law to reference with respect to aggregate incidents and mate1iality, and such a requirement would be extremely 7 SEC Proposed Rules 8 SEC Proposed Rules 9 https:// da tamatters. sidley. com/new ly proposed sec cybersecurity risk mana gement rules and amendments for pu blic companies 10 SEC Proposed Rules Enhancing the quality of life for all we serve Restaurant.org I ~ WeRRestaurants 2055 L Street NW, Suite 700. Washington. DC 20036 difficult to monitor on a continuing basis. Again, realistically, it may take months of diligent work to dete1mine the full scope of any single ( or multiple) incident(s) given the complexity, scope, and detailed technical work that must be completed during an incident response. As new mate1ial facts come to light during a typical incident rnsponse, previous material disclosures will likely need to be revised, updated, and reported (between annual/periodic reports) to co1Tect or update outdated public infmmation. It is not clear how this will benefit shareholders and would most certainly be an undue burden on companies attempting to comply with various laws and regulations in a responsible fashion. The Association disagrees with the Commissions position that data breaches and security incidents have a material long term effect on share prices, and we believe the SECs proposed rules should pennit reasonable delays for reporting cyber incidents. A reasonable delay provision would be paiticularly helpful in circumstances when a companys contractual obligations would require informing a downstream business paitner of the notification to the government, but law enforcement deems that infonning the affected third party is counter to the investigations best interests. Fmiher, because of the challenges in assessing or quantifying the impact of a cyber incident during its earliest stages, detennining the materiality of one or multiple incidents under the cuITent proposed framework could lead to premature or incorrect disclosures under the 4 day reporting timeline, which would prove more harmful than beneficial to the victim company, law enforcement, and, ultimately, the shareholders themselves. We therefore suggest that the SEC consider including a reasonable delay provision that aligns with the Federal Trade Commissions without unreasonable delay repmting standards for personal health information, and ultimately allows for forensics, understanding of damage or impact, and discussion with regulators and plaintiffs to occur while avoiding potential new ha1ms from premature disclosures. IV. Disclosure of a Registrants Risk Management, Strategy and Govemance Regarding Cybersecurity Risks The SEC is proposing Item 106(b) of Regulation S K to require registrants to provide more consistent and detailed disclosure regarding their cybersecurity 1isk management and strategy. Tue Commission ai·gues that disclosure of a companys relevant policies and procedures would benefit investors by improving their understanding of a companys cybersecurity risk profile. Additionally, item 106( c) of the SECs proposed mies would require disclosure of a compai1ys cybersecurity policies, procedures, and governance strategies, including the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk and a description of managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.11 While the Association appreciates the Commissions desire to better understand publicly traded companies cyber incident policies and governance, we believe this aspect of the proposal would create new potential risks for companies by enlightening bad actors to its cyber incident mitigation strategies. The restaurant industry recognizes the impo1tance of establishing cyber 1isk mitigation policies and ai·e already making great strides in doing so, but the proposal as drafted appears to incentivize specific decision making processes that may or may not be prudent for a particular organization. Revealing the secret sauce behind a companys internal cyber mitigation strategies will only put a bigger target on its back, which ultimately hurts investors by creating more potential for ha1m to the company than it prevents. Additionally, pre existing federal and state data security laws have generally not included a requirement to comprehensively disclose internal policies and procedures unless there is a material weakness in the internal contI ol over financial repo1ting (ICFR). When this does occur, companies typically disclose the nature of the deficiency leading to the mate1ial weakness, tl1eir remediation plans, and any changes in ICFR. They are not cuITently required to provide a detailed desc1iption of the conu·ols themselves. 11 SEC Proposed Rules Enhancing the quality of life for all we serve Restaurant.org I ~ WeRRestaurants 2055 L Street NW, Suite 700, Washing ton, DC 20036 I The Association suggests that the Commission does not include the disclosure of a companys cybersecurity infrastructme in the final rnle unless some kind of confidentiality protection framework is incorporated that would allow companies to demonstrate their preparedness for a potential cyber incident while not creating additional risk exposure for the company and its shareholders. V. Disclosures Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecmity Expertise Finally the SEC proposes to amend Item 407 of Regulation S K by adding paragraph (j) to require disclosure of the cybersecurity expertise of a registrants members of the board of directors. Toe Commissions proposed rnlemaking says, [i]f any member of the boaJd has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such direct.or(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully desc1ibe the nanue of the expeitise.12 The Association recognizes the importance of films maintaining robust governance strncmres and comprehensive compliance programs with a repmting line to escalate cyber issues to senior management and the Board (or Board Committee). We agree with the Commission that Boards should exercise some oversight of cybersecmity programs. However, governance strncmres are different for companies where cybersecurity is mission c1itical (i.e., critical infrastrnctme entities) compared to companies that merely require good cyber hygiene to operate successfully on a day to day basis. Ultimately, the Association believes that the precision of the Board composition repo1ting requirement to disclose the specific degree of their involvement in approving policies and procedures is hard to quantify, overly prescriptive and difficult to implement in a practical way. Instead, we suggest that it may make sense for the Commission to tailor the Board requirements to CISA aligned critical industries. Thank you again for the opp01tunity to comment on the SECs proposed rnlemaking, Cybersecmity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. While we support the policy goals behind the proposed reporting, disclosme, and cyber hygiene requirements, the National Restaurant Association urges the Commission to rescind its proposal in its cmTent fonn due to our concerns about potentially duplicative or conflicting repo1ting requirements in other federal and state laws, the additional data privacy and security concerns the proposal would inherently create, and its overall effectiveness in better informing company shareholders.

The Proposal has two primary components. First, it would require publicly traded companies to disclose their policies and procedures that identify and manage cybersecurity risks; managements role in governing those risks; any expertise of the board of directors in cybersecurity and its oversight of cybersecurity risks; and updated disclosures of previously reported cybersecurity incidents in its Form 10 K. Second, the Proposal would require publicly traded companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents to investors in Form 8 K within four days after determining it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The Proposal builds off previous guidance issued by the staff and the Commission to ensure more standardized and timely disclosures to investors of cybersecurity risks, governance, and incidents. The proposed Item 106 disclosures in Form 10 K will better inform investors of the cybersecurity risks posed to the operations, reputation, and financials of a publicly traded company. Additionally, the proposed Item 1.05 in Form 8 K will inform investors of material cybersecurity incidents promptly, which will minimize the ability of corporate insiders and malicious actors to trade on material, nonpublic information at the expense of investors.

Reg. 16,590 (Mar. 23, 2022). Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 2   Commission should move forward with the Proposal after adding the enhancements described below. BACKGROUND Speaking on the topic of cybersecurity in 2012, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller said there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.3 The former FBI Directors words are just as true now, if not more so, than they were back in 2012. While technology has revolutionized the way corporations conduct business, it has not come without its own set of risks and vulnerabilities. A 2019 survey of cybersecurity professionals reinforces the former FBI Directors statement, with almost half of respondents reporting an increase of cyberattacks on their organization and 79 percent reporting they expect to experience a cyberattack next year.4 The question of whether or not a company will experience a cyberattack is becoming less a matter of if it will happen and more of a matter of when it will happen and how much damage will it cause.  The rise in the sheer number of cyberattacks and their growing sophistication has led many to acknowledge cybersecurity threats as one of the top risks facing the private sector. In the World Economic Forums Global Risks Perception Survey, respondents cited cyberattacks and data fraud or theft as two of the top five global risks. This is in stark contrast with the results from the same survey conducted ten years earlier, which mentioned neither cyberattacks nor data fraud among the top five global risks.5 To help put the perceived risks surrounding cybersecurity into context with other risks posed to companies, the PricewaterhouseCoopers Annual Global CEO Survey found that cybersecurity edged out the COVID 19 global health crisis as the threat CEOs are most worried about over the next 12 months.6 That point bears repeating—CEOs view the potential threat of a cyberattack or data breach to be a greater threat to their company than the risk posed by a global pandemic, a pandemic that has unfolded over two years and exacted a huge toll in human life and economic suffering.  Just as we have seen the economic damage a global pandemic can have on companies of all sizes, we have also seen the crippling effects a major cyberattack or data breach can have on a company. For example, we saw the largest gas pipeline operator and largest meat processing plant in the U.S. forced to halt operations due to a pair of cyberattacks in 2021 that cut off 45% of the oil to the East Coast and halted production of a company that provides one fifth of the U.S.s meat  3  Robert S.

Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 3   supply.7 In addition, malware and ransomware attacks increased in 2020 by 358% and 435%, respectively, from the previous year.8 When you combine the debilitating consequences of a successful cyberattack, combined with the relentless threat of attack, it is no wonder cybersecurity is the top threat to U.S. companies cited by CEOs. Unfortunately, this trend shows little sign of abating in the near future as businesses become more dependent on digitizing their operations and storing more and more valuable data within their networking systems. This all serves as further motivation and riper targets for cybercriminals to ramp up their cyberattacks. For each data breach, experts have estimated that the average cost per record breached was $161 in 2021, a 14.2% increase since 2017.9 While $161 per record may not seem like a large sum of money in isolation, it actually suggests huge collective costs, as cybercriminals are less likely to target individuals and more likely to target businesses and organizations with vast troves of data representing thousands and millions of records. This number also does not account for the financial damage wreaked on the individual consumer or investor who has had their sensitive information breached, which can be debilitating and devastating. In the case of large breaches, the financial damage of a cyberattack or data breach can have consequential and systemic consequences not only in the markets but also on society as a whole. A few large breaches have become case studies on how not to handle a significant cyberattack. In 2014, the company formerly known as Yahoo! Inc., learned that hackers had stolen the usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, and passwords for hundreds of millions of user accounts.10 Although senior management and the legal department at Yahoo! Inc. were well aware of the breach, the company did not disclose the breach to its investors or the public until two years after the attack, in a filing during the process of being acquired by Verizon Communications, Inc.11 The Commission ordered Yahoo! Inc. to pay a $35 million penalty.12  Moreover, Verizon subsequently cut the price it was willing to pay for Yahoo! Inc. by $350 million after news of the data breach was announced.13 After the close of the sale, it was discovered that all three billion Yahoo! Inc. user accounts were affected by the hack. This episode vividly illustrated how not to handle a cyberattack and data breach after one has occurred; just as important, it also showed that a companys failure to have policies and procedures in place to deal effectively with a cyberattack can affect vast numbers of investors. In this case, aside from users having their private information hacked, Yahoo! Inc. investors lost more than $500 million in fines, shareholder lawsuit costs, and a lower sale price due to these failures by the company. Another example of a corporate cybersecurity failure is the Equifax cyberattack and data breach. In 2017, hackers successfully gained access to Equifaxs database of information on 143  7  See Financial Stability Oversight Council, Annual Report 62 (2021). 8  World Economic Forum, The Global Risks Report 9 (2019), https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF Global Risks Report 2019.pdf. 9 IBM, Cost of a Data Breach Report 13 (2021), https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY. 10  Altaba Inc., No. 3 18448 2 (Securities Exchange Commission April 24, 2018).  11  Id. 12  Id. at 9. 13  Vindu Goel, Verizon Will Pay $350 Million Less for Yahoo, N.Y.

Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 4   million American consumers, including social security numbers, drivers license numbers, and more than 200,000 credit card numbers.14 Hackers were able to penetrate Equifaxs systems after Equifax failed to update a critical patch to address a vulnerability in its network. Executives at the company were made aware of the loss of personal identifiable information on July 31, but they did not disclose the breach to the public until September 7 via a press release.15 For five weeks, Equifax insiders withheld knowledge of this breach of sensitive, personal identifiable information from shareholders, investors, policymakers, and the public at large. This cybersecurity failure was further compounded when certain high ranking employees were able to sell their stock in the company during the five week period before the breach was announced to the public.16 After the announcement of the data breach, Equifaxs stock price plummeted 35%, and those employees pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings from selling their stock before disclosure. Equifax later agreed to a settlement of nearly $1 billion with regulators17 and agreed to spend an additional $1 billion on cybersecurity upgrades.18 Both major incidents occurred in spite of the Commissions staff guidance regarding disclosure obligations for cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents issued in 2011. This staff guidance was the Commissions first foray into cybersecurity risk and incident disclosure. At the time, and to this day, the securities laws and rules contained no disclosure requirements specifically relating to cybersecurity risks and incidents.19 However, as the risks posed by cyber threats to publicly traded companies continued to mount, the Commission took the view that those risks and incidents could trigger the longstanding obligation to disclose material information to investors.20 For the first time, the staff guidance laid out an overview of how cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may fall under various types of disclosure obligations, including disclosure as part of a companys risk factors; managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations; description of business; financial statement disclosures prior to, during, and after a cyber incident; and disclosure controls and procedures.21 As a result of the increasing significance of cybersecurity incidents and in the wake of the Yahoo! Inc. and Equifax data breaches, the Commission believed it necessary to provide further guidance in connection with cybersecurity disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws in 2018.22 The 2018 Commission guidance reinforced and expanded upon the 2011 guidance with two additional topics, including the importance of cybersecurity policies and procedures and  14 Examining the Equifax Data Breach: Hearing Before the H.

The increase in remote work has made companies and organizations more vulnerable to cyberattacks through the increased use of teleworking strategies, including virtual meeting applications and virtual private networks.25 Research has found that data breaches where remote work was a factor in the breach increased the total cost of a breach by $1.07 million on average.26 This raises the level of vigilance that all companies must maintain in connection with cybersecurity vulnerabilities and further demonstrates the growing risk cybersecurity poses to corporate America.  OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL  The Commission has proposed several rule amendments governing disclosure of cybersecurity risk management policies, procedures, and incidents by registrants. Specifically, the Proposal would:  • Amend Form 8 K to require registrants to disclose material information about a cybersecurity incident within four business days after the registrant determines a material cybersecurity incident has occurred;  • Amend Forms 10 Q and 10 K to require registrants to provide regular updated disclosures relating to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents, as well as require registrants to amend these forms when individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become material in the aggregate;  • Amend Form 10 K to require registrants to disclose their policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; managements role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing policies and procedures; and the expertise, if any, of the board of directors and its oversight role of cybersecurity risk;  • Amend Regulation S K to require disclosure of any cybersecurity expertise by any member of the board of directors; 23  Id. at 8,167. 24  Id.  25 Financial Stability Oversight Council, Annual Report 62 (2021). 26 IBM, Cost of a Data Breach Report 13 (2021), https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 6   • Amend Form 20 F to require foreign private issuers to disclose cybersecurity policies, procedures, and incidents similar to domestic registrants;  • Amend Form 6 K to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic; and • Require the cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL). COMMENTS  I. Mandatory and uniform cybersecurity disclosure requirements in proposed Item 106 will better inform investors about the cybersecurity risks posed to companies.  The Proposals cybersecurity risk, governance, and incident disclosure requirements in Item 106 of Regulation S K will better inform investors of the cybersecurity risks posed to the operations, reputation, and financials of a publicly traded company. While existing securities laws, regulations, and case law currently require registrants to report material information, there are no disclosure requirements that specifically refer to cybersecurity risks or incidents other than the 2011 staff guidance and 2018 guidance adopted by the Commission. Despite the serious risk posed by cybersecurity to a businesss operations, reputation, and financials, investors are often left to search for piecemeal disclosures regarding cybersecurity risks, policies and procedures, and incidents that management may elect to make in various places in a companys annual and quarterly reports. The Proposals mandatory and uniform cybersecurity disclosure requirements in proposed Item 106 will better inform investors of the cybersecurity risks posed to companies and make it easier to find the relevant information.  As mentioned previously, cybersecurity is often cited by business leaders as the top risk or threat posed to their business. In fact, an analysis of Form 10 K filings of the Fortune 100 companies found that 100 percent of the companies listed cybersecurity as a risk factor in the risk factor disclosure section of their annual report.27 Typically, a company would develop a set of risk management systems to deal with such a pervasive threat, one that executives and companies are acknowledging to investors.28 These policies and procedures would normally be designed to identify, assess, and manage these risks, and they may be subject to oversight by the board and management.29 However, staff in the Division of Corporation Finance have found that of those companies reporting cyber incidents in 2021, many of those same companies did not describe their oversight efforts or policies and procedures related to cybersecurity.30 Notwithstanding the consensus surrounding the risk posed by cybersecurity in corporate America, there is a clear lack  27  Steve W. Klemash, Jamie C. Smith, and Chuck Seets, What Companies are Disclosing About Cybersecurity Risk and Oversight, Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance (Aug. 25, 2020), https://corpgov.law harvard.edu/2020/08/25/what companies are disclosing about cybersecurity risk and oversight/.  28  Release at 16,599. 29  Release at 16,599. 30  Release at 16,599. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 7   of uniformity surrounding how cybersecurity threatens specific business operations and the policies and procedures companies establish to mitigate those risks. While the disclosure of a cyber incident is helpful for investors to understand the risks posed to a companys business operations and financials, how a company responds to mitigate those risks may be just as important. Therefore, a companys cybersecurity policies and procedures disclosures are critical if investors are to truly understand the gravity of the incident and its possible effects on a companys bottom line and stock price. Accordingly, understanding a companys policies and procedures regarding cyberattacks is clearly necessary to assess the companys ability to prevent and blunt the impact of any future attacks. One need look no further than the filing of Form 10 K for Pilgrim Pride Corporation as an example of this phenomenon. In 2021, the largest meat processing plant in the U.S. and the parent of the Pilgrim Pride Corporation, JBS USA Holdings Inc., suffered a crippling cyberattack that led to a halt in nearly all of its business operations, including those of the Pilgrim Pride Corporation.31 After paying an $11 million ransom to the hackers, JBS USA Holdings was able to regain control of its systems and continue with regular business operations. Despite the company losing control of its business operations for an entire day, the disclosures in Pilgrim Pride Corporations Form 10 K devoted only two paragraphs of a 118 page document to the event and other cybersecurity disclosures, all of which were buried under the heading Business and Operation Risk Factors.32 Despite losing control over its business operations, Pilgrim Pride Corporation determined that none of these actual or attempted cyber attacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition.33 The 10 K filing continues with a very broad description of the event, without any mention of the companys cybersecurity policies and procedures. This demonstrates that even when a company suffers a severe cyber incident, they do not always, and in fact rarely, disclose corresponding cybersecurity policies and procedures to give investors any ability to evaluate the likelihood of future attacks and the ability of the company to mitigate and remediate their impact.  Even in instances where a company discloses relevant cybersecurity incidents, board and management oversights and abilities, and policies and procedures in a comprehensive manner, the information is scattered throughout various sections of the Form 10 K. While the 2018 guidance adopted by the Commission successfully identified potential disclosure requirements for companies to think about when disclosing cybersecurity risks, governance, and incidents, it did not solve the problem confronting investors who must search various sections of the Form 10 K for the disclosures. As the Proposal points out, these cybersecurity disclosures may currently be disclosed in:  • Item 105 of Regulation S K (Risk Factors); 31  Fabiana Batista, Michael Hirtzer, and Mike Dorning, All of JBSs U.S. Beef Plants Were Forced Shut by Cyberattack, Bloomberg (May 31, 2021), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021 05 31/meat is latest cyber victim as hackers hit top supplier jbs. 32  Pilgrims Pride Corporation, Annual Report (Form 10 K) 11 (Feb. 18, 2022). 33  Id. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 8   • Item 303 of Regulation S K (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations);  • Item 101 of Regulation S K (Description of Business);  • Item 103 of Regulation S K (Legal Proceedings);  • Item 407 of Regulation S K (Corporate Governance); and • Regulation S X Financial Disclosures.34  The scattered and unpredictable nature of such cybersecurity disclosures, which investors must search to locate in the Form 10 K, diminishes their effectiveness. It would be far more useful for investors to better understand the cybersecurity risks posed to specific companies if these disclosures were more uniform and easier to find, as laid out in the Proposal.  The proposed new Item 106 to Regulation S K in the Proposal would provide investors with a more uniform and comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity risks, governance, and incidents of publicly traded companies. Proposed Item 106 would require disclosure of updates to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents, as well as:  • A registrants policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks;  • A registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks; and  • Managements role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies.35  This will not only enable investors to better understand the cybersecurity risks, governance, and incidents of companies they are currently invested in but also enables them to more easily compare cybersecurity policies and procedures across different publicly traded companies when making investment decisions. As the top risk facing companies, according to the nations CEOs, investors need this information in a readily accessible and readable fashion. In short, the proposed Item 106 to Regulation S K would help investors gain a much better understanding of the always important and potentially catastrophic cybersecurity risks facing publicly traded companies.  The Proposal should be further strengthened to explicitly require registrants to disclose whether or not it has established any cybersecurity policies or procedures. Under the current requirements of the Proposal, a registrant would not have to explicitly state it has not established  34  Release at 16,593 16,594. 35  Release at 16,595. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 9   cybersecurity policies and procedures if it has not done so. The Proposal rightfully asks the question, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures?36 For many of the same reasons we support proposed Item 106, we would answer that question in the affirmative. As mentioned several times throughout this comment letter, cybersecurity is often considered to be the top risk facing companies. Therefore, it is appropriate for companies to disclose to investors if they have established policies and procedures to address this risk. Investors will surely want to know if there are policies and procedures in place at the companies they invest in to mitigate the risks of cyberattacks and data breaches, which can bring with them operational, reputational, and financial harm. Enabling companies that have not established cybersecurity policies and procedures to hide this fact from investors would undermine the intended goals of this Proposal to better inform investors about a registrants risk management, strategy, and governance.37 For these reasons, the Proposal should require companies that have not established policies and procedures to inform investors of this critically important and potentially pivotal lapse in corporate governance. The Proposal should also be strengthened by requiring a simple disclosure to investors of whether or not a registrants cybersecurity risk assessment program has been audited by a third party. The Proposal partly addresses this concern in proposed Item 106(b), which would among other things, require disclosure of whether the registrant engages assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program.38 The Proposal would provide more meaningful insight to investors about the resiliency of a companys cybersecurity risk assessment program if it required a simple disclosure as to whether the companys program was audited by a third party with expertise in auditing cybersecurity risk assessment programs annually. While a company may already have a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment program, the ever changing landscape of cyberattacks makes it necessary to remain vigilant against these attacks, and periodic auditing helps maintain that vigilance. The auditing and testing of a companys cybersecurity risk assessment program by a third party that did not design or establish the program provides an extra check against cyberattacks by malicious actors. The audited status of a cybersecurity program would therefore provide investors with additional information with which they could assess a companys approach to managing cyber risk. Yet according to analysis of the annual reports of a representative group of 100 companies, only 17% of companies indicated that their policies and procedures were audited by a third party.39 A clear disclosure in the Form 10 K would better inform investors about the cybersecurity risks posed to a companys business operations, reputation, and financials.   36  Release at 16,601. 37  Release at 16,590. 38  Release at 16,600. 39  Vaishnavi Ravishankar, Olivia Mooney, and Nore Hader, Stepping Up Governance on Cyber Security, Principles for Responsible Investment 5 (2018), https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5134.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 10   II. The Proposals incident reporting requirement will inform investors of material cybersecurity attacks and data breaches in a timely manner and minimize the opportunity for corporate insiders and malicious actors to benefit financially.  The Proposals cybersecurity incident reporting requirement will enable investors to learn about the operational, reputational, and financial risks to a company from a cyberattack in a timely and standardized manner. Despite past guidance issued by the Commission, the current cybersecurity incident reporting system is a hodgepodge of disclosures in Form 8 K, press releases, or periodic reports, including instances when a cybersecurity incident is reported through a press release but not reported in any filings with the Commission.40 The Proposal would help ensure appropriate disclosures are made, in a standard form, and in a centralized location.  The Proposals requirement that companies file Item 1.05 of Form 8 K within four days after experiencing a material cybersecurity incident will empower investors with important, timely, and standardized information regarding the operational, reputational, and financial risks to a company of a cyberattack or data breach. Additionally, Item 1.05 of Form 8 K will provide companies with a clear, standardized way of relaying this material information to investors, without having to wrestle with decisions about how to disclose a cyber incident. Thus, as cybersecurity risks continue to pose a top risk to companies, the Proposals Item 1.05 of Form 8 K will help protect investors in a way that is fair and efficient from the standpoint of issuers. The Proposals four day disclosure requirement will have the added benefit of minimizing the period of time corporate insiders and malicious actors will have to trade on material, nonpublic information before that information is disclosed to the public. As mentioned previously, the Equifax data breach was a case study in policy and procedure failures in responding to a cyberattack and data breach. More than five weeks passed from the time the company learned of the data breach and its disclosure to the public via a press release. During this five week period, multiple corporate insiders sold large amounts of their stock in Equifax, pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars prior to the public disclosure of the massive cyberattack.41 Additionally, the four day disclosure requirement would minimize the time during which hackers can profit from their own attacks in the markets. Hackers often target companies in search of a ransom payment or the opportunity to sell stolen data on the dark web, but they also have been known to sell information about their impending cyberattack to other bad actors or short a stock themselves to receive an additional financial benefit from their schemes.42 The Proposals four day disclosure  40  Release at 16,594. 41  See Press Release, Department of Justice, Former Equifax manager sentenced for insider trading (Oct. 16, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/usao ndga/pr/former equifax manager sentenced insider trading.; Press Release, Department of Justice, Former Equifax employee sentenced for insider trading (June 27, 2019), https://www.justice.gov/usao ndga/pr/former equifax employee sentenced insider trading.  42  See Bradley Barth, Ransomware gang offers traders inside scoop on attack victims so they can short sell their stocks (Apr. 23, 2021), https://www.scmagazine.com/news/security news/ransomware/ransomware gang offers traders inside scoop on attack victims so they can short sell their stocks (An entry on the DarkSide Leaks site dated April 20 states: ‘Now our team and partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and other stock exchanges. If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to provide Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 11   requirement will substantially reduce the amount of time corporate insiders and malicious actors have to trade on inside information at the expense of investors.  The Proposal should further be strengthened by expanding the class of cyber incidents that trigger the reporting obligation. The Proposal currently includes a non exhaustive list of examples of cybersecurity incidents that may trigger the four day disclosure requirement, including an incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered.43 This example should be expanded to account for evolving kinds of cyberattacks that do not steal or alter company data but nevertheless generate illicit profits from the attack and have significant and adverse impacts on a business. As we saw in the Pilgrim Pride Corporation case, ransomware attacks can cripple a companys ability to conduct business without stealing or altering data. A ransomware attack has the ability to lock companies out of their own systems until a ransom is paid, as was the case with Pilgrim Pride Corporation. Thus, for example, the Proposal should provide that any cyberattack that ultimately extracts any form of payment from a company should be considered an example of a cybersecurity incident that would trigger the proposed Item 1.05 disclosure. The need to broadly define the reportable incidents is clear. Despite the cyberattack shutting down operations at one of the largest meat packing companies in the world, Pilgrim Pride Corporations mention of the attack in its 10 K filing made it clear they did not believe this met the standard for a material event.44 If all companies were to view cyberattacks through the same lens used by the Pilgrim Pride Corporation, then even attacks that have the ability to shut down business operations would be viewed as non material events for which full disclosure was  unnecessary. If allowed to prevail, this view would undermine the purposes of the Proposal.  Therefore, the Proposal should take as broad a view as possible to ensure that any ransom or other payment related to a cyberattack requires disclosure.

FEI is a leading international organization comprised of members who hold positions as Chief Financial Officers, Chief Accounting Officers, Controllers, Treasurers, and Tax Executives at companies in every major industry. CCR is FEIs technical committee of approximately 50 Chief Accounting Officers and Corporate Controllers from Fortune 100 and other large public companies, representing more than $13 trillion in market capitalization. CCR reviews and responds to pronouncements, proposed rules and regulations, pending legislation, and other documents issued by domestic and international regulators and organizations such as the U.S. SEC, PCAOB, FASB, and IASB. This letter represents the views of CCR and not necessarily the views of FEI or its members individually.  Executive Summary  We commend the Commissions efforts to build on the existing regulatory framework and interpretive guidance for cybersecurity disclosure, and to enhance the availability and comparability of information disclosed about cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incidents. As business operations become increasingly reliant on data and technology, cybersecurity continues to be a high priority for registrants, and we support the Commissions focus on increasing transparency to inform investors about the risks and incidents associated with such trends. In our letter, we include specific feedback and considerations on issues related to reporting on an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, information resources that are used but not owned, and the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents that have become material in the aggregate.  Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on an Item 1.05 Form 8 K  We support the Commissions decision to use the date on which a cybersecurity incident is deemed to be material, rather than the date of discovery, to trigger the four business day filing deadline for an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Focusing disclosure on incidents that are material to investors will streamline the reporting  2  process and help investors more easily identify decision useful cybersecurity impacts. In the following sections, we provide specific suggestions and considerations related to materiality determinations, the definitions of key terms, and additional risks that could arise when cybersecurity incident reporting conflicts with other legal obligations or highlights ongoing vulnerabilities.  Materiality Determination We believe that many registrants already disclose material cybersecurity incidents in accordance with previous SEC staff guidance issued in 2011 and 2018. The proposed amendments will provide additional structure to the reporting of such incidents, which will likely drive greater consistency in the timing and scope of disclosures. However, we believe that registrants may face certain challenges associated with making materiality determinations in accordance with more specific incident reporting requirements. For example, some situations may present clear facts and circumstances that allow management to make a materiality determination coincident with discovering a cybersecurity incident,1 while at other times, determining the materiality of a cybersecurity incident may be more difficult and require significantly more effort to assess downstream impacts. In these situations, there is an increased risk that judgments made about materiality, particularly judgments based on indicators that correlate with the passage of time (e.g., a sustained decline in sales or increase in costs associated with business interruption) could be second guessed. To mitigate these concerns, we encourage the Commission to affirm in the final rule that, in regard to both the materiality assessments of cybersecurity incidents and the timeliness of such assessments, well reasoned2 judgments made by management will be deemed appropriate3 to the extent they are supportable. Definitions of Key Terms We recommend that the Commission remove the concept of jeopardizes from the definition of cybersecurity incident. The use of such a term implies that a vulnerability alone could trigger an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, which we do not believe is the Commissions intent. We recommend revising the definition such that it is clear that an Item 1.05 Form 8 K would be triggered only upon the occurrence of a material event, rather than upon the occurrence of an event that creates a vulnerability that could lead to a material event in the future should the vulnerability be exploited.  We also recommend that the Commission work closely with other government agencies, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to align the definitions of cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems to the extent possible. Such coordination is particularly relevant as CISA begins  1 See page 28 of the proposing release. 2 On page 24 of the proposing release, the Commission mentions the need for a well reasoned, objective approach when assessing whether a cybersecurity incident is material. 3 This approach would align with messaging that has consistently been provided by the SEC staff over many years. For example, in response to increased uncertainty during the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, SEC Chief Accountant Sagar Teotia issued a public statement noting that the Office of the Chief Accountant has consistently not objected to well reasoned judgments. Similar remarks have previously been made by the Division of Corporation Finance, such as when Associate Chief Accountant Todd E. Hardiman stated that reasonable judgment is the foundation of our financial reporting system.  3  rulemaking on cybersecurity incident reporting in accordance with the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act.4 Under the SECs proposed rule, determining cybersecurity reporting obligations would necessitate coordination between multiple departments, and relatively consistent definitions across government agencies would streamline cross functional communication and understanding and promote more consistent disclosure by registrants. Nevertheless, as the Commission contemplates aligning definitions with other organizations, we believe it will be important for businesses to be able to distinguish material incidents under SEC reporting from substantial incidents under CISAs pending rulemaking given the differences in objectives between the two agencies. In this regard, we recommend that the Commission prioritize clarity over alignment.  Additional Risks from Reporting Cybersecurity Incidents We understand that the SEC has provided some flexibility around the level of detail that registrants must include when describing the nature and scope of cybersecurity incidents in an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. We also acknowledge that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors may justify not providing for a reporting delay in some situations. However, we believe that there may be circumstances where a reporting delay is warranted due to conflicting legal obligations under federal, state, or international law, or when disclosure is likely to alert a malicious actor and lead to significant incremental harm to a registrant or its employees, customers, or business partners. In such situations, we recommend that the Commission provide a mechanism by which registrants may, within four business days of determining that a cybersecurity incident is material, submit confidential notice to the SEC informing the Commission of a delay in filing an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. In a subsequent consultation, the registrant and SEC could meet to discuss the facts and circumstances around the delay and determine when filing the Item 1.05 Form 8 K would be appropriate. The following non exhaustive list includes several examples where we believe such an exception would be appropriate: • When law enforcement has been granted a court order that restricts a registrant from making public disclosure regarding an ongoing investigation related to the cybersecurity incident. • In issues of national security where the Attorney General or other competent authority requests a delay in reporting a cybersecurity incident, or a written request for a delay has been submitted to the Attorney General or other competent authority. • When a foreign regulatory authority restricts a registrants ability to comply with the proposed cybersecurity incident reporting requirements. • When disclosing details of a material cybersecurity incident could put a registrant or its employees, customers, or business partners at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents by alerting malicious actors to significant vulnerabilities and threat channels that might be further exploited. 4 On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, which will require reporting of covered cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours after a covered entity reasonably believes that a covered cyber incident has occurred.  4  While we understand the importance of providing investors with information about material cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner, we believe it is important for the Commission, at a minimum, to consider the potential incremental harm to investors that may result when registrants are required to prematurely disclose details of incidents while vulnerabilities still exist. In this regard, we believe that the proposed requirements to (1) describe the effect of an incident on a registrants operations, and (2) indicate whether an incident has been remediated, could potentially inform malicious actors as to the success or failure of their attacks before appropriate remedial measures are complete. We urge the Commission to conduct additional outreach to fully understand the potential security implications of requiring disclosure in such cases prior to moving forward with the proposed disclosure requirements and issuing a final rule. Information Resources that are Used but Not Owned  Some registrants may not currently be able to obtain information needed to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them. In some situations, third party contracts may need to be aligned with the scope of the proposed rule to allow for materiality assessments to be communicated within a reasonably practicable timeframe5 for information resources used but not owned by a registrant. Registrants may also need time to design a comprehensive framework and implement robust processes around third party relationships to allow materiality determinations and any required incident reporting to occur in accordance with the proposed rule. Therefore, while registrants work through such implementation challenges, we recommend that the Commission provide a temporary safe harbor that would limit the liability of registrants to making a reasonable effort to obtain and evaluate information from any impacted third party information resource when evaluating the materiality of cybersecurity incidents.  Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material in the Aggregate  We support the Commissions decision to require disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K, as opposed to on Form 8 K, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate. However, there may be challenges in operationalizing the proposed disclosure requirement as written. For example, determining what constitutes a series of incidents may prove challenging due to the complexity and potential number of incidents to evaluate. Furthermore, without clarification, we expect diversity in practice to emerge in interpreting the meaning of series and determining the period over which related6 incidents must be aggregated.7 To mitigate these challenges, we recommend clarifying the meaning of series and limiting the period over which registrants are expected to track a series of incidents to a reasonable period. We also recommend that the Commission  5 As outlined in the proposed Instructions to Item 1.05 on page 127 of the proposing release. 6 Page 33 of the proposing release includes a statement that registrants would need to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality. 7 Page 34 of the proposing release includes an example in which a number of smaller but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company are aggregated, but it is unclear over what period registrants would continue to aggregate such attacks.  5  conduct further field testing to determine whether a clarified definition of series would be consistently interpreted and could be effectively operationalized by registrants. We believe more effort in this regard will ultimately yield more comparable and decision useful disclosure for investors.  Conclusion  We appreciate this opportunity to provide feedback on the Commissions proposed rule on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure. We thank the Commission for its consideration of our comments and welcome further discussion at your convenience.

Sullivan, CPCU, AIC, AIM, AIS, Sr. Director, Emerging Risks, American Property Casualty Insurance Association",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128335-291090.pdf,"2 | P a g e Incident Reporting  We encourage the SEC to reconsider the timing for disclosing a material cybersecurity incident and to permit a filing delay under certain enumerated circumstances.  Under the proposed rules, registrants must disclose a material incident within four business days after the registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident it has experienced is material, even if the vulnerability remains active, no patch or fix has been made available, law enforcement has requested a delay, or an investigation remains ongoing. As described in more detail below, this requirement complicates a registrants ability to respond in a controlled manner, frustrates law enforcement efforts, may increase the severity of an incident, and could be exploited by bad actors, including to attack other companies that may be unaware of the vulnerability in question. To alleviate some of these concerns, we recommend the SEC provide an option to a registrant to delay reporting for up to 30 days (as opposed to four days) after the materiality determination under the following circumstances: (1) where a registrant reasonably believes that disclosure of the cybersecurity incident would materially disadvantage the registrants ability to contain and remediate the incident, or (2) at the request of law enforcement. If filed after four days, the Form 8 K disclosure could be required to include a discussion of the registrants rationale for the filing delay. We believe that permitting a registrant to delay the filing for a short period of time strikes an appropriate balance between timely disclosure to shareholders and an opportunity for a registrant to achieve the best resolution for itself and its shareholders. Allowing up to 30 days for disclosure would also bring the SECs proposal in line with data breach disclosure requirements at the state level. The SEC should allow an extension of cybersecurity incident disclosures because companies need flexibility to employ a variety of methods and strategies to respond to and remediate an incident. In some instances, registrants may need to monitor a situation before reporting in order to best contain and mitigate the incident. In others, law enforcement may recommend a course of action that could extend beyond four days, or the incident may stem from a third party vendor and a registrant may be dependent on the third party to conduct an appropriate investigation and to provide relevant information.  For example, if a registrant were to find malware or ransomware on its system that had not yet been triggered, the best approach may be to watch the activity on the system (for more than four days) to identify an approach to contain the malware/ransomware before it spreads. Disclosing the event would alert the bad actor about what the registrant knows which may accelerate the bad actors efforts to the registrants detriment. Likewise, delaying public disclosure may also be necessary in a situation where a zero day incident is discovered or where an incident is not yet widely known but is believed to have a potentially significant impact (e.g., SolarWinds and Log4j). In these instances, reporting the incident publicly before a patch has been issued would put the registrant and other companies defending against the attack at a disadvantage compared with malicious actors seeking to exploit the vulnerability.  3 | P a g e Public disclosure of real or perceived system vulnerabilities prior to remediation may also put other bad actors on notice and provide an opportunity for vulnerabilities to be exploited. Moreover, premature public disclosure would lead to numerous inquiries from outside parties, such as regulators, shareholders, and the media. An unintended consequence of premature disclosure is that registrants may have to divert much needed attention and resources away from the incident response to handling those inquires. Investors would also receive incomplete information that will likely change as the incident investigation progresses. Instead, the SEC should allow sufficient time to remediate a cyber incident prior to any mandated public disclosure. Safe Harbors APCIA supports the SECs inclusion of safe harbors for failing to timely file a Form 8 K disclosure, and we would expect the safe harbor to extend to any reporting delay. (See Proposed Rules §§ 13a 11(c) and 15d 11(c)). The safe harbor appropriately recognizes the fluid nature of cybersecurity incidents, materiality assessments, and corrective efforts. Third Party Breaches APCIA recommends clarifying the proposed definition of information systems, which the rule currently defines as information resources owned or used by the registrant…. (Emphasis added.) The language used by would require that a registrant disclose a cybersecurity incident of a third party provider, which could include, for example, an incident impacting a shared data center. However, registrants using third party providers may not receive timely notice of the incident and may not receive the information that a registrant is required to provide in its Form 8 K. Worse, requiring disclosure of vendors in the event of a data breach could expose a registrant to new threats from malicious actors seeking access points to the registrants systems. To address these concerns, the definition of information systems should be limited to systems managed by a registrant or systems managed at a registrants direction. Alternatively, we encourage the SEC to clarify that a registrants filing requirement for a cybersecurity incident involving a third party provider is not triggered until the registrant has received actual notice of the incident and has made the materiality assessment. Even with this clarification, a registrant would be required to make reasonable inquiries of the third party provider to obtain the information needed for the required disclosure. We further recommend that the safe harbor described in the proposed rules (§§13a 11(c) and 15d 11(c)) be extended to include, in addition to failing to timely file, deficiencies in the disclosure to the extent the missing information was not available from the third party.  Threats APCIA is concerned that the examples of cybersecurity incidents that may be subject to disclosure include circumstances where a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to publicly disclose sensitive company data. This could potentially require disclosure simply because someone makes a threat, even if the bad actor does not actually have access to a registrants data. Such disclosures are unnecessary and would be potentially misleading or confusing for investors. In addition, we are concerned this requirement could lead to a whole new class of attack, where a bad actor could attempt to extort a company by demanding payment in exchange for the bad actor not making a threat that would trigger a public disclosure.  4 | P a g e  To address these concerns, this example should clarify that threats do not need to be disclosed unless there is cause to believe a malicious actor actually possesses or has access to sensitive company data. Previous guidance from the SEC already establishes criteria that should be used by companies to determine the materiality of an incident. However, this example and others seem to lower the existing threshold and introduce more uncertainty. Series of Incidents We are also concerned with the proposed requirement for companies to disclose, to the extent known to management, when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate. This would potentially require companies to go back several years or an indefinite period to determine whether cybersecurity incidents are material. Materiality may change with additional investigation, and the point at which the four business day reporting requirement begins is unclear. It is also unclear what creates a series of incidents—multiple attacks from the same attacker, multiple attacks originating from the same country, multiple attacks of the same type from different attackers, etc. To create a more workable standard, the proposal should set a one year limitation to the analysis of when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate. The proposal should also specify what constitutes a series of incidents. Registrants should not be required to consider individually immaterial incidents unless the incident took place within the last year and the incidents are clearly connected. A longer lookback period would be overly burdensome for companies, with limited or no benefit to investors. Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance Risk Management and Strategy APCIA strongly urges the SEC to reconsider the proposed rules requirement for registrants to disclose their cybersecurity risk oversight, strategy, policies, and procedures. These disclosures would provide a blueprint of a companys vulnerabilities to malicious actors, causing significant new threats to both insurers and their policyholders. Moreover, insurers are already subject to substantial cybersecurity governance and compliance requirements at both the state and federal levels. In response to escalating cyber risks and increasing regulation, insurers and their policyholders have adopted robust security controls, and insurers continue to invest in new technologies designed to help public and private sector policyholders minimize and protect against cyber threats. Requiring disclosure of these strategies would neutralize their effectiveness and potentially harm the nations cyber resilience. It could even lead to potentially more cyber attacks to the extent companies are required to disclose details that would relate to their cyber insurance coverage. Further, it is unclear how investors would benefit from these disclosures. In any event, the inherent risk involved with disclosing a companys cybersecurity strategy far outweighs any benefit the disclosures would provide.  5 | P a g e Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise Finally, the SEC should reconsider mandating disclosures about the cybersecurity expertise of members of a companys board of directors. If enacted, these disclosure requirements would likely transform into a de facto requirement for registrants to find board members with cybersecurity expertise because the absence of such board expertise may be misconstrued by the public as a signal that a company does not take cybersecurity seriously. Perceived gaps in cybersecurity expertise on the board could also lead to a proliferation of securities litigation, including for companies that, in fact, have robust cybersecurity controls. However, no evidence has been provided by the SEC that this would improve the cybersecurity posture of registrants or provide additional benefits to investors. Since companies commonly maintain vigorous cybersecurity programs without specific board expertise, these proposed disclosures would provide little, if any, benefit toward furthering the proposals objective of giving investors a better understanding of registrants cybersecurity risk. In fact, the proposal could create new cyber vulnerabilities by exacerbating demand for cybersecurity professionals. By encouraging companies to hire cybersecurity experts to board positions, the field of potential qualified candidates to fill these positions  which is already scarce  would shrink even further. According to the tracking site Cyber Seek (www.cyberseek.org), in the U.S. there are currently 597,767 cyber security positions open within 1,053,468 total jobs, or 56.7% of all positions need to be filled. Additionally, per Cyber Seek, there are only enough cybersecurity workers in the United States to fill 68% of the cybersecurity jobs that employers demand. APCIA is concerned that the knock on effects of this proposal will make it more difficult for insurers and their policyholders to find the talent necessary to stem the increasing and ever evolving threat of cyber attacks.

As the largest public defined benefit pension fund in the United States, we manage approximately $470 billion in global assets on behalf of more than 2 million members. As a global, institutional investor with a long term investment horizon, we seek long term sustainable, risk adjusted returns through efficient capital allocation and stewardship in line with our fiduciary duty. Furthermore, we believe that all investors, whether large institutions or private individuals, should have access to disclosures that allow them to make informed proxy voting and investment decisions. CalPERS Investment Beliefs1 recognize that long term value creation requires effective management of three forms of capital: financial, physical, and human.2 Accordingly, our fiduciary duty requires that we proactively assess whether the companies that we hold in our portfolio are managing capital effectively. Our Governance and Sustainability Principles3 identify robust governance practices as being critical to long term performance; therefore, we expect fair, accurate, timely, and assured reporting about how companies manage these three  1 CalPERS Investment Beliefs, https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/organization/calpers story/our mission vision#investment beliefs.  2 Id. 3 CalPERS Sustainability Principles, https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/forms publications/governance and sustainability principles.pdf.  Page 2 of 4 forms of capital to generate sustainable returns, including how they identify, monitor, and mitigate risks. Moreover, these Principles hold that an effective risk oversight process considers both internal company related risks such as operational, financial, credit, solvency, liquidity, corporate governance, cybersecurity, environmental, reputational, social, product safety; and external risks, such as geopolitical, industry related, systemic, and macro economic. Given the widespread reliance of modern society on technology, cybersecurity is a risk that may have a material impact, to a greater or lesser extent, upon any of these aforementioned risks public companies must navigate. We applaud the prior work of the SEC to highlight and clarify the disclosure obligations of public companies regarding their cybersecurity risks and incidents, including issuing interpretive guidance in 2011 and 2018. We also appreciate the Commissions recognition of the importance that investors place on cybersecurity, as evidenced by its proposed rulemaking for cybersecurity of investment advisors and investment companies4 released earlier this year. We believe the boards of all companies, investment vehicles and external investment managers we invest in and do business with must be accountable for overseeing the use of our capital. It is their duty to ensure their companies function as risk intelligent organizations, and we believe the adoption and implementation of that proposed rulemaking will strengthen cybersecurity preparedness and improve the resilience of investment advisers and investment companies against cybersecurity threats and attacks. I. RISK MANAGEMENT, STRATEGY & GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE Beginning with the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2017 (S. 536 by Senator Jack Reed (D RI))5, we have consistently supported6 legislative efforts to require publicly traded companies to disclose in their annual reports or annual proxy statements, whether any member of their governing body, such as a board of directors, has expertise or experience in cybersecurity issues. Similarly, the Proposed Rule would address the increasing prominence of cybersecurity threats in our financial markets and the broader economy by requiring the disclosure of cybersecurity expertise on corporate boards. Specifically, we believe boards of directors should set out specific risk tolerances and implement a dynamic process that continuously evaluates and prioritizes risks7 as detailed previously. Further, we agree with the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) that, Effective cybersecurity risk management starts with the board. Users should expect companies of various sizes, industries and cyber risk profiles to bring different strategies, in varied stages of  4 SEC Proposed Rule S7 04 22  Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment Companies, and Business Development Companies. https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR 2022 03 09/pdf/2022 03145.pdf. 5 S. 536, 115th Congress. https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s536/BILLS 115s536is.pdf.  6 CalPERS Letter in Support of S. 536, dated July 26, 2017. https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/legislative regulatory letters/congress senate 536 cybersecurity disclosure act 07 26 2017.pdf.

Page 3 of 4 implementation, in response to this massive and growing challenge.8 We have advocated for board policies and voted our proxies in alignment with these CII recommendations on how boards of directors can effectively and efficiently ensure their companies have developed and implemented an effective cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance framework.9 With this Proposed Rule, the Commission has taken a vital next step to ensure investors have access to periodic disclosures about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risk and the impact of these risks on business strategy; managements role and expertise in implementing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies; and the board of directors oversight role, and cybersecurity expertise, if any. Moreover, the proposed reporting regime for material cybersecurity incidents will allow investors to assess the effectiveness of public companies cybersecurity related policies and procedures. Beyond supporting cybersecurity strategies that address internal company related risks, ensuring board members understanding of the cybersecurity landscape is also vital to their understanding of external company related risks. We believe the board is ultimately responsible for a companys risk management philosophy, organizational risk framework and oversight. The board should be comprised of skilled directors with a balance of broad business experience and extensive industry expertise to understand and question the breadth of risks faced by the company.10 Risks posed by cybersecurity incidents and threats should be understood by board members, and we have long advocated that board members should develop and have cybersecurity expertise. II. INCIDENT REPORTING AND MATERIALITY  CalPERS enthusiastically supports the Commissions efforts to require current and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity incidents. We agree with the Commissions prior guidance that if cybersecurity incidents or risks materially affect a companys products, services, relationships with customers or suppliers, or competitive conditions, the company must provide appropriate disclosure.11 Cybersecurity incidents can have various material impacts on investment and proxy voting decisions; for example, a reasonable shareowner would likely consider information on cyberattack induced product and service disruptions when making such decisions. Just last month, the U.S. Department of Energy and various U.S. intelligence agencies warned energy companies of new malware that targets electricity and natural gas infrastructure systems.12 As part of an effective risk oversight process, cybersecurity considers both internal company related risks and external risks, and any malware attack on a public company that provides energy to the American public should be disclosed to shareowners. The Proposed Rule also includes requirements that registrants report certain cybersecurity incidents. We noted an example of a cyberattack causing a product or service disruption above,  8 Council of Institutional Investors, Prioritizing Cybersecurity, April 2016 https://www.cii.org/files/publications/misc/4 27 16%20Prioritizing%20Cybersecurity.pdf.  9 Id. 10 CalPERS Total Fund Investment Policy, p.76. https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/total fund investment policy.pdf.  11 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, February 26, 2018 https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf.  12 U.S. warns energy firms of a rapidly advancing hacking threat, April 14, 2022 https://www.eenews.net/articles/u s warns energy firms of a rapidly advancing hacking threat/.  Page 4 of 4 but many other types of cybersecurity incidents ought to be reported as material. For example, cyberattacks could ransom a registrants customers confidential information in exchange for cryptocurrency. These kinds of incidents can be time sensitive and can lead to direct harm to a registrants customers, impacting the registrants reputation and bottom line in the process. The Commissions past guidance, while in line with our views, does not go far enough. The Proposed Rule is needed to provide clarity regarding what, when, and how to disclose material cybersecurity incident information. Commission staff appropriately noted that current reporting is inconsistent, may not be timely, and can be difficult to locate.13 The improved standardization of disclosures included in the Proposed Rule adds clarity to the reporting process. III. CONCLUSION CalPERS supports the adoption and implementation of the Proposed Rule to require periodic disclosures of registrants risk management, strategy, and governance regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as more complete and timely disclosures of material cybersecurity incidents, because it ensures that investors have access to crucial decision making information to better assess the ability of corporate management to adequately address cybersecurity risks. Moreover, it helps to promote capital market efficiency by providing greater insight into the extent to which companies are focused on data security and the protection of consumer information.

In this effort, the AIC develops, analyzes, and distributes information about the private equity and private credit industries and their contributions to the U.S. and global economy. Established in 2007, and formerly known as the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, the AIC is based in Washington, D.C. The AICs members are the worlds leading private equity and private credit firms, united by their commitment to growing and strengthening the businesses in which they invest.2 The AIC has supported and continues to support transparency as it relates to cybersecurity risks in the public markets. Because the AIC membership includes registered investment advisers (RIAs) that invest in the public markets, as well as RIAs with publicly traded parent entities, 1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, SEC Release No. 33 11038; IC 34529 File No. S7 09 22; 87 FR 16590 (March 9, 2022) (the Proposing Release). 2 For further information about the AIC and its members, please visit our website at http://www.investmentcouncil.org. 2 the AIC appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on potential challenges that the implementation of the Proposed Item would have on issuers.  This letter contains three sections. The first section identifies the provisions of the Proposed Item that are the subject of this comment letter. The second section highlights the concerns we have in connection with those provisions. The third section proposes alternative solutions and makes recommendations that would further the SECs goals, while alleviating some of the concerns expressed in the second section.  I. The Proposed Items Applicability to Issuers  The Proposed Item includes an amendment to Form 8 K that would require issuers to disclose a material cybersecurity incident in a Form 8 K filing.3 Proposed Item 106(a) defines a cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.4 Issuers would need to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after a determination that the cybersecurity incident was material and must make such materiality determinations as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.5 The disclosure would need to include several details about the incident to the extent known by the issuer, including (1) when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; (2) a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident; (3) whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose; (4) the effect of the incident on the issuers operations; and (5) whether the issuer has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. 6 An ongoing internal or external investigation would not justify a reporting delay.7 II. Why the Proposed Item Is Not Optimal for Meeting the SECs Objectives The stated purpose of the Proposed Item is to address a growing concern that material cybersecurity incidents are underreported and that existing reporting may not be sufficiently timely.8 The Proposed Item is designed to provide timely and relevant disclosure to investors and other market participants (such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers) and enable them to assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity incident on 3 Proposing Release at 16595 96. 4 Id. at 16601. 5 Id. at 16596. 6 Id. at 16624. 7 Id. at 16596. 8 Id. at 16595. 3 the registrant, including any long term and short term financial effects or operational effects. 9 However, as drafted, the Proposed Item could actually undermine the SECs mission of protecting investors because it would likely lead to a deluge of vague and inaccurate disclosures to the market, leading to investor confusion as to the likely financial or operational effects of cybersecurity incidents. In many cybersecurity incidents, very little information is known with any degree of certainty within the first four days, and what is known often turns out to be incorrect or incomplete. For example, suppose a public company first discovers unauthorized activity in its network on a Monday morning. The Company quickly assesses that it was the victim of a ransomware attack, and its defenses appear to have limited the damage to a small number of machines that are not material to its overall operations. The attacker nonetheless claims to have taken a significant amount of data, demands a payment of $1 million, and threatens to release the alleged stolen data if the payment is not made. By Friday morning, in spite of a full scale investigation that commenced immediately, the Company still cannot confirm that the attacker no longer has any access to its network; the Company can neither confirm nor refute the assertion that data has been stolen; and the attacker has not identified the nature of the data that it allegedly stole. This level of uncertainty is very common in the early days of a cybersecurity incident.  If the Proposed Item were in effect, the Company would have to assess whether this event is a material cybersecurity incident that requires Form 8 K disclosure. The Company would start by confirming that it was an unauthorized occurrence on its information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Companys information systems and information residing therein. The Company would then look at the following examples of cybersecurity incidents listed in the Proposed Item that may trigger a Form 8 K disclosure requirement, and conclude that each of them could apply because the company cannot rule out the possibility that the incident is material:   An unauthorized incident that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset (data, system, or network); or violated the registrants security policies or procedures;  An unauthorized incident that caused degradation, interruption, loss of control, damage to, or loss of operational technology systems;  An incident in which an unauthorized party accessed, or a party exceeded authorized access, and altered, or has stolen sensitive business information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, or information that has resulted, or may result, in a loss or liability for the registrant;   An incident in which a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to publicly disclose sensitive company data; or   An incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered. 9 Id. 4 Accordingly, the Company may well conclude that it should make a disclosure, rather than wait for all the relevant facts to become settled, which could take weeks. The Company would understandably be concerned that waiting would create significant risk of a perceived violation of the four business day notification deadline if subsequent investigation confirms the materiality of the incident.  The Company would then go through the list of items that must be included in the disclosure to the extent known, and struggle with each of them because what is known is still very preliminary and could change. For example, as to whether the incident was ongoing, the Company could only say that it might be. As to whether data was stolen, the Company could only say that the attacker has alleged that it has stolen data, and the Company has been unable to confirm that or rule it out, and it does not know whether the stolen data, if any, is sensitive or material. This kind of vague disclosure will confuse investors and could result in an unwarranted plunge in the stock price. If new favorable information about the incident is uncovered over the weekend, the Company would likely feel the need to provide an updated Form 8 K on Monday, which could cause the stock to recover the lost value.  The Proposed Item incentivizes issuers to file placeholder disclosures that contain information that is vague or likely to change, in order to avoid any doubt that they have met the four business day notification requirement. The resulting flood of ambiguous and equivocal disclosures (which will include notifications for cybersecurity incidents that ultimately turn out not to be material) will undermine the SECs investor protection mission because investors will not be able to identify the information that actually matters to their investments. Indeed, given the likely volume of 8 Ks that will be of limited value, investors may become numb to these disclosures  which would undercut the SECs stated purpose of equipping investors and market participants with information to assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity incident on an issuer. Moreover, premature disclosure of cybersecurity incidents will trigger inquires from customers, counterparties, investors, auditors, the media and regulators. Responding to these inquiries consumes an enormous amount of resources and therefore impedes issuers efforts to investigate and remediate what may ultimately turn out to be immaterial incidents. Indeed, issuers will likely want to notify many of these stakeholders before filing the Form 8 K, to avoid them learning about the incident indirectly. As such, the early days of incidents will be consumed with drafting notifications to multiple constituencies, and then constantly redrafting them as new information becomes available, diverting precious resources away from responding to and remediating the incident itself. To reduce these risks, we recommend that the Commission:   Provide a clarification that by using the words determined by the registrant to be material and information known to the registrant, the SEC intends that a determination of materiality that triggers notification in the Proposed Item should be based on information that is known with a high degree of confidence and is unlikely to change.  Expand the notification deadline to five business days to ensure that issuers have at least a calendar week to file a Form 8 K, which will provide additional time for facts to be developed that are unlikely to change.  5  Provide examples of a material cybersecurity incident to limit the confusion that may cause companies to feel obligated to disclose events that could become material, but are not actually material. III. Proposed Alternatives and Recommendations Item 1.05 Clarification The SEC should clarify that the Proposed Item only requires issuers to disclose information that is known with a high degree of confidence and is unlikely to change. Item 1.05 states that if an issuer experiences a cybersecurity incident that it determine[s] . . . to be material, it must disclose certain information regarding the incident to the extent known to the issuer. Without further guidance, it is unclear what degree of confidence the issuer must have regarding whether the information is accurate or likely to change. The public would receive higher quality disclosures that would need fewer updates and revisions with an interpretation in the Final Rule that a determination of materiality that triggers notification should be based on information that is known with a high degree of confidence and is unlikely to change. Extended Timeline We believe that an extended reporting timeline to at least five business days (and therefore at least one calendar week) would better serve the SECs stated goals to provide timely and relevant disclosure to investors and other market participants and enable them to assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity incident. The additional day would (1) provide issuers with the time they will need to develop relevant facts that are not likely to change, (2) use those facts to conduct a meaningful materiality analysis, and (3) assuming the incident is determined to be material, draft a Form 8 K disclosure that will be relevant and helpful to the market. Material Incident Examples Finally, the SEC should provide concrete examples of cybersecurity incidents that it would consider material. Although each incident is unique, examples would help issuers make a materiality determination by providing a benchmark for disclosure, which in turn would increase the quality of disclosures and lessen the number of placeholder disclosures made containing incomplete information that is of little value to investors. Examples of material cybersecurity incidents could include incidents that involve:  Network operational stoppage for more than [x] hours that has caused harm to a significant portion of the business or a significant number of customers;  Confirmed ongoing unauthorized access to the companys network for more than [x] days after initial detection; and  Unauthorized acquisition of sensitive company or customer data that is likely to result in significant business or reputational damage, or harm to a significant number of customers.  6 ***** The AIC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Item and would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have concerning our comments.

ABSTRACT  Constant cyber threats result in: intellectual property loss; data disruption; ransomware attacks; theft of valuable company intellectual property and sensitive customer information. During March 2022, The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a proposed rule addressing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, which requires: 1. Current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents; 2. Periodic disclosures about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; 3. Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures; 4. Board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk; 5. Registrants to provide updates Page 2 about previously reported cybersecurity incidents in their periodic reports; and 6. Cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL).  To paraphrase Lord Kelvins famous observation, you cant manage what you dont measure. How then does the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) craft a disclosure regime that captures in a structured data format all those measurable components of costs that allows management and investors to better understand the true costs incurred in cyber defense and breach mediation? This inquiry logically dovetails into the broader question of externality costs associated with cyberattack that, when ignored by industry, are placed as additional burdens upon government and other institutions (such as municipalities, school systems and universities) and customer citizens when their identity data is stolen and fraud committed against them. SEC chair Gary Gensler states, The economic cost of cyberattacks is estimated to be at least in the billions, and possibly in the trillions, of dollars. Hackers have attacked broker dealers, governmental agencies, meat processors, and pipelines. These attacks can take many forms from denials of service to malware to ransomware. By now, a broad understanding of the pervasive threat of cyberattack from international criminal organizations, nation states, and even poorly capitalized criminal elements are legion. We will not replicate that discussion here, except to briefly mention several recent attacks to illustrate some of the difficulties and challenges in capturing accurate aggregate cost data.  We commend the SEC for their March 2022 issuance of a proposed rule addressing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. In the following pages we recommend that the SEC build upon the March 2022 proposed rule by creating a Cyber Data Disclosure Commission to be comprised of relevant stakeholder groups to investigate and promulgate suggestions for a standardized disclosure regime for cyber data. Our task of creating a template that will define and capture those measurable costs that are necessarily required for a meaningful analysis is multifaceted. Just a few of the many complex issues include:  1. What cybersecurity disclosure information is useful to investors?; 2. What investments in cyber defense are period costs?;  3. Which costs should appropriately be capitalized such as secondary data recovery centers (if any) and amortized over what period of time (for reporting purposes)?; 4. How do we measure known losses?  5. Which imputed costs (if any), such as lost sales, are appropriate for inclusion in our measurement? 6. Can agreement be reached about how reputational costs associated with cyber breaches should be measured (imputed)? Our paper proceeds in seven parts. First, we provide a brief discussion about the difficult challenges associated with capturing cyber threat data. Second, is a brief history of the SEC disclosure regime. Third, we address the economics of cybersecurity. Fourth, we provide a proposed schematic for composition and workflow for an SEC Cyber Data Disclosure Commission. Fifth, we highlight the important implications of this study for the preservation of U.S. national security interests. The American business community is Page 3 a critical link in the national cyber security equation. Any weak link in the system constitutes an unacceptable vulnerability for all citizens. Sixth, we recommend the Commission consider asking Congress to pass legislation creating a Public Company Cybersecurity Oversight Board for publicly traded companies similar to the PCAOB. And last, we conclude. We believe this proposal is significant and represents a timely contribution in fostering better cooperation between all interested stakeholders in cyber hygiene and security.

APPENDIX 67   Page 5 A PROPOSED SEC CYBER DATA DISCLOSURE ADVISORY COMMISSION OVERVIEW  Public disclosure isnt new. Weve been requiring disclosure of important information from companies since the Great Depression. The basic bargain is this: investors get to decide what risks they wish to take. Companies that are raising money from the public have an obligation to share information with investors on a regular basis. Over the decades, theres been debate about disclosure on things that, today, we consider pretty essential for shareholders.  Today, investors increasingly want to understand the climate risks of the companies whose stock they own or might buy. Large and small investors, representing literally tens of trillions of dollars, are looking for this information to determine whether to invest, sell, or make a voting decision one way or another.

These attacks can take many forms from denials of service to malware to ransomware.4 By now, a broad understanding of the pervasive threat of cyberattack from international criminal organizations, nation states, and even poorly capitalized criminal elements are legion.5 We will not replicate that discussion here, except to briefly mention several recent attacks to illustrate some of the difficulties and challenges in capturing 3 See OXFORD ESSENTIAL QUOTATIONS, OXFORD UNIV.

We commend the SEC for their March 2022 issuance of a proposed rule addressing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure,6 to require: 1. Current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents; 2. Periodic disclosures about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; 3. Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures; 4. Board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk; 5. Registrants to provide updates about previously reported cybersecurity incidents in their periodic reports; and  6. Cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline extensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL).7  Proposed Cyber Data Disclosure Advisory Commission In the following pages we recommend that the SEC build upon the March 2022 proposed rule by creating a Cyber Data Disclosure Advisory Commission to be comprised of relevant stakeholder groups to investigate and promulgate suggestions for a standardized disclosure regime for cyber data. Our task of creating a template that will define and capture those measurable costs that are necessarily required for a meaningful analysis is multifaceted. Just a few of the many complex issues include:  1. What cybersecurity disclosure information is useful to investors?; 2. What investments in cyber defense are period costs?;  3. Which costs should appropriately be capitalized such as secondary data recovery centers (if any) and amortized over what period of time (for reporting purposes)?; 4. How do we measure known losses?  5. Which imputed costs (if any), such as lost sales, are appropriate for inclusion in our measurement? 6. Can agreement be reached about how reputational costs associated with cyber breaches should be measured (imputed)?  6 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Exchange Act Release No. RIN 3235 AM89 (Mar. 9, 2022) [Hereinafter Proposed Rule]. 7 Id. Page 8   Our paper proceeds in seven parts. First, we provide a brief discussion about the difficult challenges associated with capturing cyber threat data. Second, is a brief history of the SEC disclosure regime. Third, we address the economics of cybersecurity. Fourth, we provide a proposed schematic for composition and workflow for an SEC Cyber Data Disclosure Commission. Fifth, we highlight the important implications of this study for the preservation of U.S. national security interests. The American business community is a critical link in the national cyber security equation. Any weak link in the system constitutes an unacceptable vulnerability for all citizens. Sixth, we recommend the Commission consider asking Congress to pass legislation creating a Public Company Cybersecurity Oversight Board for publicly traded companies similar to the PCAOB. And last, we conclude. We believe this proposal is significant and represents a timely contribution in fostering better cooperation between all interested stakeholders in cyber hygiene and security. I. CHALLENGES OF CAPTURING CYBER THREAT DATA  The SECs March 2022 issuance of a proposed rule addressing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure states, where possible, we have attempted to quantify the benefits, costs, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected to result from the proposed amendments. In many cases, however, we are unable to quantify the potential economic effects.8 Herein lies the problem and the basis for the contribution made by this paper. The SEC acknowledges that:  [W]e lack information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate. Where we are unable to quantify the economic effects of the proposed  8 See Proposed Rule, supra note 6 at 55. Page 9 amendments, we provide a qualitative assessment of the potential effects and encourage commenters to provide data and information that would help quantify the benefits, costs, and the potential impacts of the proposed amendments on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.9 Not only do regulators need this granular information to formulate effective policy, but management, directors, and investors need structured data presented in a meaningful and comparable format to facilitate decisions about this critically important issue. This proposal presents a schematic to achieve just that. Many Successful Infiltrations Undetected  By now, it is likely that essentially all organizations possessing valuable  information have been successfully penetrated by outside entities. In many cases the data architecture of breached entities has successfully been explored and mapped. Former National Security Agency (NSA) director of research Frederick R. Chang has observed, generally, there are two only types of companies: those that know they have been breached, and those that dont know they have been breached.10 Externalities Abound  Examples of cyber breaches abound of situations presenting difficult to define aggregate cost scenarios. For example, when an airline experiences a data breach that results in flight cancellations, the airline knows how many flights have been cancelled, passengers rebooked on their later flights, and revenue lost forever when passengers take other carriers. Economists would also suggest that impacted passengers, as a result, likely incur costs associated with missed connections, absences from important meetings,  9 See Proposed Rule, supra note 6 at 55. 10 Lawrence J. Trautman, Seletha Butler, Frederick Chang, Michele Hooper, Ron McCray & Ruth Simmons, Corporate Directors: Who They Are, What They Do, Cyber and Other Contemporary Challenges, 70 BUFFALO L. REV. 459 (2022), http://ssrn.com/abstract=3792382. Page 10 unreimbursed unexpected lodging and meal expenses, loss of productive time, etc. Customer loyalty is a very valuable asset to an airline. Should data breaches happen more than once, passengers may change their affiliation loyalty.  In the case of data breaches resulting in the loss of personally identifiable information (PII) such as the Target breach during 2013,11 Mariott (2019),12 or Yahoo (2013),13 all these companies incurred costs resulting from these breaches. However, many of their customers also incurred unreimbursed expenses as a direct result of these breaches, if only in terms of the lost time and expense associated with mitigating adverse credit reporting events. Congress has recently conducted multiple hearings aimed at understanding the adverse impact of nation state supported actors in fraudulently hijacking social media platforms for use as propaganda proxies.14 We suggest that this is not without serious costs to our society.  History of Poor Cyber Threat Information  Our history of failed cyber risk management is punctuated with poor information security cost data. Professor Tyler Moore points to the misaligned enterprise incentives that are pervasive in our experience. Consider how, Information systems are prone to fail when the person or firm responsible for protecting the system is not the one who  11 See Lawrence J. Trautman, Mohammed T. Hussein, Louis Ngamassi & Mason Molesky Governance of The Internet of Things (IoT), 60 JURIMETRICS 315, 332 (Spring 2020),  http://ssrn.com/abstract=3443973.  12 Id. at 333. 13 See Lawrence J.

Page 11 suffers when it fails. Unfortunately, in many circumstances online risks are allocated poorly.15 For example, Professor Moore states: There is an incentive to under report incidents across the board. Banks do not want to reveal fraud losses for fear of frightening away customers from online banking; businesses do not want to cooperate with the police on cyber espionage incidents because their reputation (and their stock price) may take a hit; operators of critical infrastructures do not want to reveal information on outages caused by malicious attack for fear it would draw attention to systemic vulnerabilities. The reticence to share information is only countered by the over enthusiasm of many in the IT security industry to hype threats.16 Consider that, Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure.17 Your authors contend that a necessary very first step in achieving national cybersecurity for all interested stakeholders is to devise a template for the analysis and better understanding of actual costs. In the absence of widespread understanding, no useful cost benefit analysis can be conducted with subsequent mitigation of risk. Definitions  We remain indebted to the Commission for defining the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems in their proposed rule announced during March 2022.18 Accordingly, propose Item 106 and proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05 provide that: • Cybersecurity incident means an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein;  15 Tyler Moore, The economics of cybersecurity: Principles and policy options, 3 INTL J. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION, 103, (2010). 16 Id. at 103, 109. 17 Id. at 103. 18 See Proposed Rule, supra note 6 at 41. Page 12 • Cybersecurity threat means any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. • Information systems means the information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations. What constitutes a cybersecurity incident for purposes of our proposal should be construed broadly and may result from any one or more of the following: an accidental exposure of data, a deliberate action or activity to gain unauthorized access to systems or to steal or alter data, or other system compromises or data breaches.19  II. THE SEC DISCLOSURE REGIME  Innovation doesnt come just from updating software and hardware; it also comes from the manner in which products are offered… Beyond the innovations and technologies, our economy is changing in other ways. Today, investors are demanding additional information from companies beyond what theyve sought historically, with respect to climate risk, human capital, and cybersecurity risk…  Again, ‘no regulation can be static in a dynamic society.   Gary Gensler   Chair   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission   January 19, 202220 Disclosure of material items is at the very cornerstone of U.S. capital formation and securities regulation. SEC Chair Gary Gensler states, We have a key role as the regulator of the capital markets with regard to SEC registrants — ranging from exchanges and brokers to advisers and public issuers. Cyber relates to each part of our  19 See Proposed Rule, supra note 6 at 41. 20 Prepared Remarks: Dynamic Regulation for a Dynamic Society Before the Exchequer Club of Washington, D.C., Gary Gensler, Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange Comm. (Jan. 19, 2022). Page 13 three part mission, and in particular to our goal of maintaining orderly markets.21 In addition, the Commission has, many rules that implicate cyber risk, including but not limited to business continuity, books and records, compliance, disclosure, market access, and antifraud. Our Division of Examinations (EXAMS) has put out various Risk Alerts and statements regarding cybersecurity topics and issued a report in 2020 on Cybersecurity and Resiliency Observations.22 Chairman Gensler states that the work of the Commission assists both SEC registrants and the public in preparation for and management of these cyber risks.23 History In Professor Newmans co authored Article with Professor Lawrence Trautman, he outlines the historical underpinnings of the current US disclosure regime for publicly traded companies.24 In that writing, Professor Newman notes that the current disclosure regime governing the buying and selling of securities was spawned during the early part of the 1900s. Recall the great depression and the collapse in the stock market that occurred in 1929.25 From these events, government recognized that a more formal process needed to be put in place regarding the buying and selling of ownership in companies. The history surrounding the first federal securities law act is a storied one. 21 See Gensler, supra note 3. 22 Id. 23 Id 24 Lawrence J. Trautman & Neal Newman, The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Debate Emerges from the Soil of Climate Denial, 53 U. MEMP. L. REV. (forthcoming),  http://ssrn.com/abstract=3939898.  25 The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in the history of the industrialized world, lasting from 1929 to 1939. It began after the stock market crash of October 1929, which sent Wall Street into a panic and wiped out millions of investors. Over the next several years, consumer spending and investment dropped, causing steep declines in industrial output and employment as failing companies laid off workers. By 1933, when the Great Depression reached its lowest point, some 15 million Americans were unemployed and nearly half the countrys banks had failed. https://www.history.com/topics/great depression/great depression history Page 14 In fact, it took two attempts before congress had an act it was willing to move forward with.26  The first attempt failed due to the initial acts ideological focus. Instead of the informed disclosure regime that we now have, the first attempt was based off of what is referred to as merit regulation. Merit regulation is an approach that would require regulators in essence to pick stock winners and losers; a speculative endeavor at best and one fraught with what are now clear problematic pitfalls that would result if the government was in the business of deciding which stocks may be worthy and which stocks may be unworthy for public consumption.27 Regarding the second attempt. Harvard law professor (and future Supreme Court Justice) Felix Frankfurter was called in to develop a revised bill. Frankfurters team including James Landis, Benjamin Cohen, and Tommy Corcoran drafted a bill following the British securities law approach, based primarily on full disclosure of material information leaving it to investors rather than the government to judge the merits of any stock offer.28 For political reasons, Frankfurters team decided to start with the failed first draft to use as the basis for drafting the piece of legislation that has stood the test of time and is substantively the same document that was drafted some 88 years ago.  As the story is told, Frankfurters team penned the Securities Act of 1933 over a weekend.  To this day, scholars still marvel at the 33 Acts idiosyncratic nature. The  26 See A Brief History of the 1930s Securities Laws in the United States  And the Potential Lesson for Today  Larry Bumgardner, Graziadio School of Business and Management, Pepperdine University  http://www.jgbm.org/page/5%20Larry%20Bumgardner.pdf.  27 See Comparison Between Merit Based Regulation and Disclosure Based Regulation  https://www.mbaknol.com/international finance/comparison between merit based regulation and disclosure based regulation/.  28 See A Brief History of the 1930s Securities Laws in the United States, supra note 26. Page 15 Act has been described as a masterpiece,29 a writing with interwoven complexities and neatly hidden traps,30 an intellectual Tour de Force,31 a complex mental game derived by three exceptional minds.32 The authors can attest that the Act is unique in the way it is constructed; it is all that it is referred to and more. Although the 33 Act as penned back in the early 1930s, is idiosyncratic and complex in its drafting, the 33 Acts underlying premise is a simple one: that investors receive full and fair financial disclosure when companies initially issue stock to investors. Likewise, the Exchange Act of 1934 steps in where the 33 Act leaves off and requires full and fair disclosure of publicly traded companies on a periodic and ongoing basis. The idea being, that investors will have access to company information that is readily available for use in making investment decisions.  Much has been written over the years documenting the many spectacular failures in corporate governance33 and recommending steps to be taken for improvement.34 We will not attempt to replicate these here.  29 LARRY D.

Al Sommer served a three year term as SEC Commissioner during the 1970s, and thereafter was Chair for 13 years of the Public Oversight Board, created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to help monitor accounting firms that audit public corporations.35 As Chair of the SECs 1977 Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure, attorney and professor Sommer stated, Very simply put…if every instance of adultery had to be disclosed, there would probably be less adultery.36 In explaining the Advisory Committees report, Chairman Sommer stated: [T]he Committee recognized that in any society needs and demands will exceed available resources. When that is the case, as it universally is, it is necessary that the scarce resources be allocated. It is axiomatic that such allocation will be best achieved if those involved in allocation decisions have the benefit of reliable, timely and sufficient information. Thus, in making investment decisions, investors are likeliest to make efficient allocations of resources if they have available information with those characteristics.37 Whether they like it or not, recognize it or not, many parties having various roles in the capital formation process (brokers, dealers, corporate management and board directors, investment bankers, venture capitalists, external auditors, and software and data service providers) are unwillingly drawn into the common fight to ensure cybersecurity.  35 Claudia Levy, A.A.

Through their investment decisions, investors are able to bring pressure to bear on directors, officers, investment advisers, broker dealers, and other market participants to serve investor interests. Market participants are incentivized to satisfy investor demands because investors reward and punish by how and with whom they choose to invest and transact… as a regulatory mechanism, disclosure privileges investor choice, favors private ordering over one size fits all mandates, and encourages innovation and competition.40 Climate and ESG Task Force Announced  Demonstrating the recent focus and priority of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), on March 4, 2021 the SEC announced the creation of a Climate and ESG Task Force within the Division of Enforcement.41 Led by Acting Division of Enforcement Deputy Director Kelly L. Gibson, the new task force is a Division wide effort, with 22 members drawn from the SECs headquarters, regional offices, and Enforcement specialized units.42 The Commission states: Consistent with increasing investor focus and reliance on climate and ESG related disclosure and investment, the Climate and ESG Task Force will develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG related misconduct.  The task force will also coordinate the effective use of Division resources, including through the use of sophisticated data analysis to mine and assess information across registrants, to identify potential violations.

Its work will complement the agencys other initiatives in this area, including the recent appointment of Satyam Khanna as a Senior Policy Advisor for Climate and ESG. As an integral component of the agencys efforts to address these risks to investors, the task force will work closely with other SEC Divisions and Offices, including the Divisions of Corporation Finance, Investment Management, and Examinations. Climate risks and sustainability are critical issues for the investing public and our capital markets, said Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee.43  Laws and regulations are constantly in a race to keep up with rapidly changing technological developments.44 For example, during mid February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported, federal regulators are closing in on rules requiring all public companies to disclose their greenhouse gas output. But they are struggling to figure out how much detail to demand about emissions produced by businesses suppliers and customers.45 According to financial market journalists, it appears that, SEC officials drawing up the landmark rules face a balancing act. Many investors are demanding the information so they can judge the risks faced by companies from climate change and  43 Id. 44 See Lawrence J.

[This] newly renamed Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (formerly known as the Cyber Unit) in the Division of Enforcement will grow to 50 dedicated positions.48 The SEC states: Since its creation in 2017, the unit has brought more than 80 enforcement actions related to fraudulent and unregistered crypto asset offerings and platforms, resulting in monetary relief totaling more than $2 billion. The expanded crypto assets and Cyber Unit will leverage the agencys expertise to ensure investors are protected in the crypto markets, with a focus on investigating securities law violations related to: • Crypto asset offerings; • Crypto asset exchanges; • Crypto asset lending and staking products; • Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms; • Non fungible tokens (NFTs); and • Stablecoins. In addition, the unit has brought numerous actions against SEC registrants and public companies for failing to maintain adequate cybersecurity controls and for failing to appropriately disclose cyber related risks and incidents. The Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit will continue to tackle the omnipresent cyber related threats to the nations markets. ‘Crypto markets have exploded in recent years, with retail investors bearing the brunt of abuses in this space.

Grewal, Director of the SECs Division of Enforcement.49 History of Electronic Disclosure: The EDGAR Releases  Development of an electronic disclosure system began in 1983, with a pilot system opened during fall 1984 for volunteer filings with both the Division of Investment Management and Division of Corporation Finance.50 An evaluation of these filings was conducted by the staff between January 1 and June 30, 1994, resulting in a positive assessment of the EDGAR system.51 The Commission by early 1993 began to require, electronic filings through its Electronic Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, EDGAR. This system is intended to benefit electronic filers, enhance the speed and efficiency of SEC processing, and make corporate and financial information available to investors, the financial community and others in a manner of minutes.52 In sum, the Commission recognized that, Electronic dissemination generates more informed investor participation and more informed securities markets.53 The EDGAR filing system now requires that official documents―attached to electronically submitted filings―be formatted as one of the following; HTML, American Standard Code for  49 Id. 50 Mauri L.

Page 22 Information Interchange (ASCII), or, whenever specific criteria are met, Portable Document Format (PDF).54 Extensible Business Markup Language (XBRL)  Now used worldwide by financial regulatory agencies, in recognition of the need for structured automated data analysis, during 2009 the SEC first required issuer submission of data in Extensible Business Markup Language (XBRL) format; in a separate XML file or more recently embedded in quarterly and annual HTML reports as inline XBRL… [these] facts must be associated for a standard US GAAP or IFRS taxonomy. Companies can also extend standard taxonomies with their own custom taxonomies.55 The filer submission histories and XBRL financial statement data currently included in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) currently include forms 10 K, 10 Q, 8 K, 40 F, 20 F, 6 K and their variants.56 Incorporation of this structured data schematic, ensures that facts have a consistent context and meaning across companies and between filings and are comparable between companies and across time.57 The SECs Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposed rule announced during March 2022 provides that registrants be required: [T]o tag information specified by Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and Items 1.06 and 407(j) of Regulation S K in Inline XBRL in accordance with Rule 405 of Regulation S T (17 CFR 232.405) and the EDGAR Filer Manual. The proposed requirements would include block text tagging of narrative disclosures, as well as detail tagging of Quantitative amounts disclosed  54 EDGAR―How Do I, SEC.gov., https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filer information/how do i (last viewed Feb. 19, 2022).  55 EDGAR Application Programming Interfaces, SEC.gov, https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec api documentation.  56 Id. 57 Id. Page 23 within the narrative disclosures. Inline XBRL is both machine readable and human readable, which improves the quality and usability of XBRL data for investors.  Requiring Inline XBRL tagging of the disclosures provided pursuant to these disclosure items would benefit investors by making the disclosures more readily available and easily accessible to investors, market participants, and others for aggregation, comparison, filtering, and other analysis, as compared to requiring a non machine readable data language such as ASCII or HTML. This Inline XBRL tagging would enable automated extraction and analysis of the granular data required by the proposed rules, allowing investors and other market participants to more efficiently perform large scale analysis and comparison of this information across registrants and time periods. For narrative disclosures, an Inline XBRL requirement would allow investors to extract and search for disclosures about cybersecurity incidents reported on Form 8 K, updated information about cybersecurity incidents reported in a registrants periodic reports, a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures, managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, and the board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risk and cybersecurity expertise rather than having to manually run searches for these disclosures through entire documents. The Inline XBRL requirement would also enable automatic comparison of these disclosures against prior periods, and targeted artificial intelligence/machine learning assessments of specific narrative disclosures rather than the entire unstructured document. At the same time, we do not expect the incremental compliance burden associated with tagging the proposed additional information to be unduly burdensome because registrants subject to the proposed tagging requirements are for the most part subject to similar Inline XBRL requirements in other Commission filings.58 Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg SCI)  Speaking during January 2022, SEC Chair Gary Gensler states, I believe we have an opportunity to freshen up Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg SCI).59 Adopted during 2014, Reg SCI covers a subset of large registrants, including stock exchanges, clearinghouses, alternative trading systems, self regulatory organizations (SROs) and the like ― financial infrastructure that is part of the backbone  58 See Proposed Rule, supra note 6 at 49 (internal footnotes omitted). 59 See Gensler, supra note 3. Page 24 of the capital markets.60 In addition, The Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), as a facility of each of the participant SROs, also is subject to Reg SCI.61 Chairman Gensler adds: The rule helps ensure these large, important entities have sound technology programs, business continuity plans, testing protocols, data backups, and so on. The core goal of Reg SCI was to reduce the occurrence of systems issues and improve resiliency when they do occur. A lot has changed, though, in the eight years since the SEC adopted Reg SCI. Thus, Ive asked staff how we might broaden and deepen this rule. For example, might we consider applying Reg SCI to other large, significant entities it doesnt currently cover, such as the largest market makers and broker dealers? To that end, in 2020, the Commission proposed to bring large Treasury trading platforms under the SCI umbrella. At our next Commission meeting, we will consider whether to re propose this rule. Similarly, I think there might be opportunities to deepen Reg SCI to further shore up the cyber hygiene of important financial entities.62  Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  The SECs March 2022 issuance of a proposed rule addressing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure has resulted in both substantial comments received by the Commission,63 and coverage and commentary in the financial press.64 Examples of information useful to investors, and all other stakeholders including those who are responsible for securing Americas national security, is described by The Wall Street Journal when they write, Under proposals from the SEC, the agency expects to know more about how listed companies manage cyber risk. Businesses would be required to disclose which board directors have cybersecurity  60 Id. 61 Id. 62 See Gensler, supra note 3. See also Paul Kiernan, SEC Looks to Boost Cybersecurity Rules, WALL ST.

Page 25 expertise, how often the topic of cybersecurity is discussed and what, if any, oversight the board has over cyber matters.65 Outside the SEC: Others say [the proposed rule] provides much needed clarity on expectations from watchdogs, as cybersecurity has become a core business risk for companies.  ‘I think its a reset, and I think the advantage of this reset is they are being very clear. Theyre telling you what they expect, said Cyrus Vance Jr., partner and global chair of law firm Baker McKenzie LLPs cybersecurity practice. In practice, security chiefs say, this means that chief information security officers and others with cyber responsibilities must learn how to translate cybersecurity data into clear risk information that nontechnical board directors can quickly understand.  This may force some companies to rethink the role itself, said Shaun Marion, CISO at fast food chain McDonalds Corp. He said when he landed his first cybersecurity executive position in 2011, he lacked experience interacting with a corporate board and didnt get much help. ‘My first board meeting was sink or swim, he said. ‘I wouldnt say I swam.  The SECs call for senior leaders and directors to understand and disclose more about their companys cyber security posture will require a strong relationship between the CISO and the board, he said. ‘It will change how we develop the next generation of CISOs, he said, relying less on technical knowledge and more on business risk experience…  Installing directors with cybersecurity expertise can help the rest of the board grasp these issues, said Baker McKenzies Mr. Vance.66 University of Texas law professor Henry T.C. Hu served as the founding Director of the SECs Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial innovation from 2009 2011 (now renamed Division of Economic and Risk Analysis). Professor Hu observes that: Since the depression, the federal governments totemic philosophy as to markets and corporations has been to help ensure a robust informational foundation for private decision makers. The rationale was that a disclosure regime center posted by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission would contribute to informed choices by market participants, furthering efficiency both in the paper economy and in the real economy. Moreover, this informational foundation would enhance corporate governance. Managements would be deterred from behavior unsustainable in the light of day, and the monitoring and disciplining of managements by  65 Id. 66 Id. Page 26 shareholders, as well as the market for corporate control, would be facilitated…  [T]his philosophy was also decidedly incrementalist. The SEC would not venture beyond the realm of information to that of substantive decision making. In the paper economy, the nature and characteristics of the securities offered, the relationships between underwriters and issuers, and the securities offering and trading prices were left to participants and overall market forces. In the real economy, corporate managements would generally be left to make their own decisions as to the deployment of resources, including in the critical area of risk taking. This philosophy stemmed… from Louis Brandeiss deep seated, compellingly expressed belief in the power―and sufficiency―of bringing sunlight to markets.67 Professor Hu contends that the SECs disclosure philosophy and its longstanding implementation methodology… are at the brink of metamorphosis… A new implementation methodology, rooted in a more comprehensive conception of information and facilitated by innovations in computer and Internet technologies, could help address such disclosure challenges.68 Now, approximately 90 years following creation of the SEC, it seems clear that the disclosure paradigm emerged in a simpler time, relied on a simple conception of information and implementation strategy, and was directed at simple goals. The modern process of financial innovation… [is] far more complex than in the past.69 Professor Hu writes: [I]n order to meet the disclosure and other regulatory challenges posed by financial innovation, it is essential that there not only be enough talented traditional lawyers at the SEC, but that there also be enough talented personnel with other skills and backgrounds. A vigorously interdisciplinary approach, enhanced by ‘local knowledge of market realities, is essential to the formulation of public policy in respect of modern capital markets…  To remain vital, the SEC disclosure paradigm must be able to encompass in a meaningful and systematic way the vast complexities of  67 Henry T.C.

A fundamental and comprehensive rethinking is essential.70  III. THE ECONOMICS OF CYBERSECURITY Rapidly Changing Technological Advances The challenge of regulating cyber security is hampered by the constantly expanding development of new and disruptive technologies. For example, in just a little over a decade, development of blockchain based technologies has created many new challenges for the SEC. Multinational criminal organizations have used virtual currencies to pay for the fruits of illegal items and activities. Regulators struggle to understand and craft new schematics to regulate: virtual currencies, distributive autonomous organizations (the DAO), and non fungible tokens (NFTs), just to name a few. Just around the corner may be novel challenges to securities regulation presented by deep fake technology where, Technologies for altering images, video, or audio (or even creating them from scratch) in ways that are highly realistic and difficult to detect are maturing rapidly… and [will] generate significant policy and legal challenges.71 Disruption to the U.S. securities regulation process may also result from advances in Quantum Computing developments.72  70 Id. at 1714. 71 See Chesney & Citron, supra note 38 at 1757 (2019).

Corporate control mechanisms are the means by which managers are disciplined to act in the investors interest.73 Accordingly, outside investors are protected from expropriation by corporate insiders by control mechanisms [that] include both internal mechanisms, such as managerial incentive plans, direct monitoring, and the internal labor market, and external mechanisms, such as outside shareholder or debtholder monitoring, the market for corporate control, competition in the product market, the external managerial labor market, and securities laws.74 Elsewhere, Professor William J. Magnuson proposes a Unified Theory of Data, to set forth harmonized and consistent rules for the gathering, storage, and use of data, and [to] establish rules to incentivize beneficial data practices and sanction harmful ones.75 We believe this proposal deserves serious consideration; but, further comment here is beyond the scope of these remarks.

Page 29 Role of Corporate Directors in Cybersecurity Governance It is a duty and responsibility of corporate directors to govern cybersecurity and cyber risk.76 Publicly traded corporations have a duty to disclose the existence of a data breach based upon at least two distinct authorities: Delaware common law and the SECs 2011 corporate finance disclosure guidance, which identifies material data security risks that companies must disclose under securities law disclosure requirements and accounting standards.77 Accordingly, companies that know about a data breach but fail to disclose it to shareholders, regulators, and consumers, risk potential liability under corporate, breach notification, and securities laws.  Well established in Delaware common law is the concept that directors and officers of a corporation have a fiduciary duty to shareholders and the corporation of disclosure—sometimes referred to as a duty of complete candor.78 Many years ago, Professor Lawrence A. Hamermesh noted that Delaware courts have recognized that a fiduciary duty to disclose all material information arises when directors approve any  76 See H. Justin Pace & Lawrence J.

Over the past decade, we have significantly expanded our understanding of how to build secure and resilient digital networks and connected devices. However, board level capabilities for strategic thinking and governance in this area have failed to keep pace with both the technological risks and the solutions that new innovations provide.81  Professor and former National Security Agency (NSA) Director of Research Frederick R.  Chang warns:  Basically, what directors need to know about cyber is that it is a strategic risk and not just an IT thing. Its easy to think of it as if, there are some routers or some switches or some firewalls that get broken, resulting in exposed data  creating a problem. Its important to step back and reflect upon how cyber is a risk, like any other risk. It can be thought of like an earthquake, or a flood or a fire. Much like an earthquake, flood or fire you cant do anything about it if theres going to be an earthquake and you are located in California. You cant stop the earthquake. All too often, it seems, there is a perception that cyber threat can actually be stopped. It cant be stopped. If a persistent attacker has a really high desire to break through, then theyre going to get through. You cant stop them  and cyber has to be viewed as a risk, like any other risk…there are some things you can do to mitigate it the risk, but you cant eliminate the risk Maybe you can buy insurance, you can bring in some more people to work on cybersecurity, and so forth. But cyber threat is fundamentally something you cant stop and it needs to be viewed at that level. So; what steps does a  79 Id. at 1091. 80 Advancing Cyber Resilience: Principles and Tools for Boards, WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (Jan. 2017). 81 Id. Page 31 board take to have enough intrinsic knowledge about cyber? The task can be a highly technical thing, but it isnt only a technical concern.82 About two decades ago Professors Bushman and Smith crafted a very useful schematic illustrating: three channels through which financial accounting information may affect economic performance [observing] Governance role of financial accounting information operates through channel 2 (Figure 1);83 and predicted interactions between financial accounting regimes and other factors in affecting economic performance (Figure 2).84 We have included these usefil diagrams as an Appendix to this document. The Allocation of Costs  The allocation of costs incurred in cybersecurity efforts is far from a straightforward task. While cybersecurity expenses paid for cyber insurance, or to a consulting firm may seem easy to identify, what portion of corporate information technology expenses should rightfully be included in this calculation. What criteria should be agreed upon so that resulting measurements are comparable across industries? What portion of a secondary data backup facility should be attributed, if any, to cyber risk management? Professors Wolff and Lehr write that an estimate of total costs for any given data breach incident must, consider the costs incurred by all market participants, which  82 Trautman, et al., supra note 10.  83 Robert M. Bushman & Abbie J. Smith, Financial Accounting Information and Corporate Governance, 32 J. ACCT. & ECON. 1, 113 (2001). 84 Id. at 114. Page 32 includes both the parties directly involved, as well as the costs that spillover onto other market participants.85 In addition:  Some of the costs to victims show up as revenues to InfoSec and [cyber insurance] providers, while the payoffs of cyber insurance claims received by victims help offset the costs born by victims… the costs that InfoSec and [cyber insurance] providers incur in developing and providing their services… should be included in the calculus of the total costs of cybercrime.86 Direct and Indirect Corporate Costs  Identification of those direct costs to be included in the computation of cyber expense is a task appropriately assigned to the accounting profession for discussion and determination. While some direct costs will be easily identifiable such as: regulatory compliance costs; fines and settlements; ransomware demands paid; lost business attributable to cyber loss  others will likely best be identifiable with the benefit of audit experience. Professors Wolff and Lehr observe that, it is much easier to estimate and observe direct costs than indirect costs. However, to estimate total costs, we need to estimate both categories of costs, and because indirect costs may be much larger, this poses a significant enduring challenge for estimates of the total economic impact of cybercrime.87 Consider: Direct costs are those that are directly attributable to a particular cause and may be assigned to an identifiable agent who bears the cost. A firm that suffers a data breach that entails the theft of PII data for its customers may need to suspend its on line eCommerce operations while it is responding to or recovering from an attack. The lost sales associated with the business interruption may be relatively easy to estimate. Similarly, the expenditures by the victim firm for InfoSec and CyberIns services and products that are used in detection, prevention, and remediation, including for forensic analysis, system repairs or replacement, notifying customers whose [personally identifiable information] [PII] has been  85 Josephine Wolff & William Lehr, Degrees of Ignorance about the Costs of Data Breaches: What Policymakers Can and Cant Do about the Lack of Good Empirical Data, 16 (2017), https://ssrn.com/abstract=2943867.  86 Id.  87 Id.  Page 33 breached and providing them with credit monitoring services, and/or in paying legal fines or settlements are direct costs that victim firms incur. Losses attributable to fraud perpetrated with the stolen PII are another source of direct cost incurred by the individuals whose PII was breached.  Indirect costs include those that are produced as secondary effects of the incident, or that spillover to others that are not directly involved in the incident. For the victims that are directly involved, the loss of brand reputation or competitive advantage that may adversely impact future sales is a potentially important source of indirect costs from cybercrime. Additionally, the loss of market trust that may slow market growth or increase opportunity costs for all market participants, or the increased likelihood of copycat attacks on other victims are examples of the indirect cost of cybercrime.88 Externalities Professor Tyler Moore has warned that, The [Information Technology] IT industry is characterized by many different types of externalities where individuals actions have side effects on others.89 Professor and seasoned corporate director Trautman recalls a conversation that has been heard in many boardrooms, and it goes like this, even if we spend every dollar we could borrow… We still wouldnt have spent enough on cyber. The North Koreans, Russians, Chinese . . . all these nations are engaged in cyber war. We dont have enough money around here to fight a war… Thats what governments are for…90 This pervasive belief results in many boards just pushing the problem off on the government, on others, on their customers and there are few prosecutions, because cyber failures are so pervasive . . . because every corporation has the same problem. Professor Moore states that, free riding is likely whenever security depends on the weakest link in the chain: firms do not bother investing in security when  88 Id.  89 Moore, supra note 15. 90 See Trautman, et al., supra note 10. Page 34 they know that other players will not invest, leaving them vulnerable in any case.91 What externality costs, if any, should be standardized for inclusion by an issuer? The Impact and Cost of Cyber Crime  Cyber crime takes many forms and continues to evolve in its sophistication. Data breach involving the loss of customer Personal Identifiable Information (PII) remains an expensive proposition for many businesses. During recent years, malware and ransomware has often resulted in substantial expense.92 The theft of intellectual property remains both discovered and undiscovered by many enterprises. From a public policy standpoint to what extent should intellectual property theft require disclosure and, if disclosable, how measured and should it be amortized, and if so, over what period or time, and by what method? In their excellent paper to be presented during June 2022, Professors Anderson, Barton, Böhme, Clayton, Gañán, Grasso, Levi, Moore, and Vasek discuss Measuring the Changing Cost of Cybercrime.93 Observing that Measurement is not straightforward, as cybercrimes frequently cross jurisdictions, and the available statistics are fragmentary,94 the authors:  91 Tyler Moore, supra note 15, citing H.

Page 35 [F]ollow the European Commissions 2007 Communication Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime, which proposed a threefold definition:  1. traditional forms of crime such as fraud or forgery, though committed over electronic communication networks and information systems;  2. the publication of illegal content over electronic media (e.g., child sexual abuse material or incitement to racial hatred);  3. crimes unique to electronic networks, e.g., attacks against information systems, denial of service and hacking.  To have a yardstick with which to measure changes, we break down fraud figures as follows. We split direct costs from indirect costs, accounting for the costs of security (which often cannot be allocated to specific crime types) and for the social and opportunity costs of reduced trust in online transactions. Where possible we decompose the costs of crime still further, splitting the criminals revenue from the costs they impose on others (which are often very much larger).  Figure 1 shows our framework, and its cost categories are as follows.  Criminal revenue is defined as the gross receipts from crime. It does not include the criminals ‘lawful business expenses, but we do need to count criminal inputs, so as to get an accurate estimate of the criminal revenue contribution to GDP. For example, where phishing is advertised by email spam sent by a botnet, we add the criminal revenue of the phisherman (the money withdrawn from victim accounts) and the amount he pays the spammer  possibly split with the ‘owner of the botnet.  Direct loss is the value of losses, damage, or other suffering felt by the victims as a consequence of a cybercrime. Examples include money withdrawn from victim accounts; time and effort to reset account credentials after compromise (for both banks and consumers); and lost attention and bandwidth caused by spam messages.  We do not try to measure distress directly; victims are not generally entitled to sue for it and it is hard to measure. Instead we try to estimate the chilling effect that cybercrime  and the fear of cybercrime  have on economic activity. This brings us to:  Indirect loss is the value of the losses and opportunity costs imposed on society by the fact that a certain type of cybercrime is carried out. Indirect costs generally cannot be attributed to individual perpetrators or victims. Examples include loss of trust in online banking, leading to reduced revenues from transaction fees and higher costs for maintaining branch staff; sales foregone by online retailers when their fraud engines cause them to decline shopping baskets; reduced uptake by citizens of electronic services whether from companies or governments; cancelled operations due to online medical services being unavailable; and efforts to clean up machines infected with botnet malware.  Page 36 Defence costs measure prevention efforts. They include security products such as spam filters and antivirus; security services provided to individuals, such as awareness raising; security services provided to industry, such as website ‘take down services; fraud detection and recovery efforts; law enforcement; and opportunity costs such as the inconvenience of missing messages falsely classified as spam.  Like indirect losses, defence costs are largely independent of individual perpetrators and victims  and even of individual types of cybercrime.  In our model, the total social cost of cybercrime is the sum of direct losses, indirect losses, and defence costs. All our figures are in nominal terms. We neglect inflation, as a 2012 dollar is worth $1.11 in 2019 dollars, and the 11% difference is way below our error margin; interest rates have also been near zero for most of this period. Similarly, differences in exchange rates are insignificant. We are not going to obsessively translate all amounts back and forth between pounds, dollars, and Euros; with the accuracy with which we can work here, these currencies might as well be interchangeable.95  Figure 1 Framework for Analysing the Cost of a Cybercrime96 Role for Cyber Insurance  For many years corporations and their boards have relied upon insurance to mitigate risk.97 It is likely that cyber risk insurance carriers have the best information  95 Id. at 3. 96 Id. 97 See Lawrence J.

Professor Yogesh Malhotra writes, Quantitative modeling of cyber risk for cyber insurance modeling is at a nascent stage characterized by sparse empirical research and reliable data.98 Experience indicates the complex nature of this task, and that the modeler, the decision maker, the regulator, and, all others involved in developing, testing, managing, or using models need to ensure alignment of the models with the reality. That is simpler said than done given… the reality in the context of global cyberspace with increasing interactions is itself dynamically changing.99 Data Privacy  Chairman Gensler has recently observed that customer and client data privacy and personal information were addressed by Congress in the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 and that, The Commission adopted Regulation S P in the wake of that law… require[ing] registered broker dealers, investment companies, and investment advisers to protect customer records and information.100 Agreement should be reached about what  98 Yogesh Malhotra, Risk, Uncertainty, and, Profit for the Cyber Era: Model Risk Management of Cyber Insurance Models Using Quantitative Finance and Advanced Analytics, iv (Jan. 2015), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2553547. 99 Id. at 158; See also Tom Baker & Griffith, Sean J., Predicting Corporate Governance Risk: Evidence from the Directors and Officers Liability Insurance Market. 74 CHICAGO L.

RECOMMENDATION Proposed Working Group Structure We propose that the SEC establish a Cybersecurity Disclosure Study Commission [working title] assigned with the task of obtaining input regarding cyber cost items that should properly be included in these calculations and disclosures. The Commission may be constructed to provide input from identified stakeholders who are recognized opinion leaders among their various constituencies (suggestions to be provided). Each sub committee will meet to discuss and formulate their thoughts for subsequent distribution to all Commission members. Stakeholder input from those parties who need detailed knowledge of their actual costs should help mitigate loss resulting from even external weakest link cyber exposure vulnerabilities. An initial (but incomplete) list of potential commission members is presented below to foster thought and discussion. Valuable input can be expected from the following stakeholders: ABA and Securities Bar Academics and Law Professors Accounting Profession AICPA FASB PCAOB CAQ Business Community Corporate Directors NACD leadership Page 39 Economists Governmental Agencies and National Security Interests [FBI] Commerce Department [NIST] Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  National Security Community [CIA, DHS, DOD, NSA, OTHERS] Insurors of Cyber Risk Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Technology Community  Federal Advisory Act Considerations  We remain indebted to Professor John C. Coffee for bringing our attention to consideration of the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).101 Professor Coffee recalls that he experienced this issue several years ago when the Bharara Task Force on Insider Trading was organized  and it may be easier not to seek Commission approval or designation (and that body was organized by an SEC Commissioner).102 Professor Coffee adds that this problem can be avoided by having no Commission member or sponsorship.103 V. IMPLICATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY  [W]hile [cyber criminals] have become more sophisticated, governments have been sluggish in responding in a meaningful way. As a result, victims are often left to fend for themselves, turning to specialty incident response firms that have developed a niche industry for negotiating decryption. The costs of lost productivity, disrupted operations, inefficiency in markets, and operational recovery likely far outweigh the dollars siphoned out of the worlds economies and dumped into illicit activities from human trafficking to the development of weapons of mass destruction. Thats right  this malware has afforded Kim Jung Uns ability to continue to expand his nuclear arsenal. How is this still only viewed as a cybercrime? Christopher C.

On Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Page 40   During recent years, many examples of nation state sponsored cyber breaches, ransomware, and the use of U.S. domestic social media by foreign interests to create political turmoil through the promulgation of disinformation campaigns are reported.105 Accordingly, weaknesses in cyber defenses among the business community is a threat to national security interests and vice versa. And, of course, the American population at large will suffer from cyber defense weaknesses elsewhere. SEC Chair Gary Gensler states, The interconnectedness of our networks, the use of predictive data analytics, and the insatiable desire for data are only accelerating.106 As observed almost daily, State actors and non state hackers alike sometimes try to target various entities and businesses… To steal data, intellectual property, or money; lower confidence in our financial system; disrupt economies; or just demonstrate their capabilities. All this puts our financial accounts, savings, and private information at risk.107 Chairman Gensler continues, Its not just the economic cost, of course. Cybersecurity is central to national security. The events of the past couple of weeks in Russia and Ukraine have once again highlighted the importance of cybersecurity to our national interest.108 A recent example of the complex nature of the relationship between nation security interests, cybersecurity, and the business community, is illustrated by Professor Charles Duans observations that  Protection, & Innovation, 117th Cong.

For example, during February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reports, Russia, which has positioned more than 100,000 troops around three sides of Ukraine, is stepping up a destabilization campaign involving cyber attacks, economic disruption and a new tactic: hundreds of fake bomb threats.110 The direct costs of war including the financing of troops, transportation, food and supplies  plus lost revenues incurred by any country perceived under threat of invasion due to lost tourist expenditures, lower economic output resulting from uncertainty, and the like. In this case, The Wall Street Journal reports, Russia is the worlds third largest oil producer, and if a conflict in Ukraine leads to a substantial decrease in the flow of Russian barrels to market, it would be perilous for the tight balance between supply and demand.111  Professors Chesney and Citron warn, Public discourse on questions of policy currently suffers from the circulation of false information.112 Sometimes lies are intended  109 Charles Duan, Of Monopolies and Monocultures: The Intersection of Patents and National Security, 36 SANTA CLARA HIGH TECH.

Page 42 to undermine the credibility of participants in such debates, and sometimes lies erode the factual foundation that ought to inform policy discourse.113 Consider: Even without prevalent deep fakes, information pathologies abound. But deep fakes will exacerbate matters by raising the stakes for the ‘fake news phenomenon in dramatic fashion (quite literally). Many actors will have sufficient interest to exploit the capacity of deep fakes to skew information and thus manipulate beliefs… Others will do it simply as a tactic of intellectual vandalism and fraud… In the absence of an agreed reality, efforts to solve national and global problems become enmeshed in needless first order questions like whether climate change is real. The large scale erosion of public faith in data and statistics has led us to a point where the simple introduction of empirical evidence can alienate those who have come to view statistics as elitist. (internal citations omitted)114  The use of deep fake technologies to achieve a deceptive and malicious altering of reality to deceive observers from the truth may present destructive results in many sectors of life, including sound and fair securities markets and the regulation thereof. Professors Chesney and Citron warn: Deep fakes will erode trust in a wide range of both public and private institutions and such trust will become harder to maintain. The list of public institutions for which this will matter runs the gamut, including elected officials, appointed officials, judges, juries, legislators, staffers, and agencies… Particularly where strong narratives of distrust already exist, provocative deep fakes will find a primed audience.  Private sector institutions will be just as vulnerable. If an institution has a significant voice or role in society, whether nationally or locally, it is a potential target. More to the point, such institutions already are subject to reputational attacks, but soon will have to face abuse in the form of deep fakes that are harder to debunk and more likely to circulate widely.115 A Seat at the Table  Your authors believe that inclusion of informed members of the U.S. national security community is necessary to achieve the best result from this project.

PROPOSED PUBLIC COMPANY CYBERSECURITY OVERSIGHT BOARD  We recommend the Commission should seriously consider asking Congress to pass legislation creating a Public Company Cybersecurity Oversight Board for publicly traded companies similar to the PCAOB.116 The PCAOB model is a nonprofit corporation established by Congress to oversee the audits of brokers and dealers registered with the SEC and public companies.117 Approval of the Boards rules, standards, and budget are governed by the SEC, with the five member PCAOB Board appointed to staggered five year terms by the SEC, after consultation with the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Secretary of the Treasury.118 In PCAOBs 2021 Annual Report they state Advancements in technology continue to affect the nature, timing, and preparation of financial information, including preparers controls around financial information, and the planning and performance of audits.119 Also during 2021, PCAOBs Office of the Chief Auditor devoted further attention to [a] research project on data and technology, informed in part by input from a Data and Technology Taskforce, to assess whether there is a need for guidance, changes to PCAOB standards,  116 We remain indebted to Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Law at the George Washington University Law School for this thoughtful, helpful and wonderful suggestion. 117 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 2021 Annual Report at 3., https://pcaobus.org/about/annual report.  118 Id. 119 Id. at 9. Page 44 or other regulatory actions.120 It now appears to us that the area of cyber threat and risk management requires its own focus and resources. VII. CONCLUSION This proposal builds upon the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) efforts to oversee the crafting and maintenance of a cyber risk disclosure regime by recommending a Commission to study the efficacy of adopting a schematic that captures in a structured data format all those measurable components of costs that allows management, boards, investors, regulators, and policy makers to better understand the true costs incurred in cyber defense and breach mediation. Our inquiry logically dovetails into the broader question of externality costs associated with cyberattack that, when ignored by industry, are placed as additional burdens upon government and other institutions (such as municipalities, school systems and universities) and customer citizens when their identity data is stolen and fraud committed against them. Not only do regulators need this granular information to formulate effective policy, but management, directors, and investors need structured data presented in a meaningful and comparable format to facilitate decisions about this critically important issue. This proposal presents a schematic to achieve just that. We believe this proposal is of significant importance and represents a timely contribution in fostering better cooperation between all interested stakeholders in cyber hygiene and security.  120 Id.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 Re: S7 09 22 SEC: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Dear Secretary Countryman:  The Federation of American Hospitals (FAH) is the national representative of more than 1,000 leading tax paying public and privately held hospitals and health systems throughout the United States. FAH members provide patients and communities with access to high quality, affordable care in both urban and rural areas across 46 states, plus Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. Our members include teaching, acute, inpatient rehabilitation, behavioral health, and long term care hospitals and provide a wide range of inpatient, ambulatory, post acute, emergency, childrens and cancer services.  We appreciate the opportunity to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) with our views in response to the Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposed rule, 87 Fed. Reg. 16,590 (March 23, 2022) (Proposed Rule). The FAH agrees broadly with the comments to the Proposed Rule submitted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (Chamber). The FAH comments emphasize certain of the Chambers comments and are based on our members experience serving patients and maintaining critical health care infrastructure. Hospitals and health systems have significant experience in navigating the cybersecurity of such information systems, requiring both expedient and thoughtful assessment and response to cyber threats, as well as allocation of limited resources. Thus, discretion and consistency with existing regulatory frameworks are key elements to be considered within the Proposed Rule. Our registrant members greatly value transparency to guide investors practical decision making; however, a perceived enhancement of such transparency via the Proposed Rule cannot come at the cost of safety and security to 2  patients and vital health care infrastructure, as well as national security. For the reasons set forth below, the FAH believes the Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance provides adequate cybersecurity reporting obligations for our registrant members, including the appropriate provision of information to investors, and urges the Commission to further collaborate with cybersecurity industry participants and other federal agencies with regard to the continued rulemaking process. Reporting Material Cybersecurity Incidents  The Proposed Rule proposes an amendment to Form 8 K to add Item 1.05 to require a public company to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, including information describing (i) when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing, (ii) the nature and scope of the incident, (iii) whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose, (iv) the effect of the incident on the companys operations, and (v) whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. The Commission has set forth a belief that the disclosure of such information within four business days of a materiality determination would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures.1 The FAH has strong concerns with both the timing and required content of such disclosures, including what the Commission deems standardized and comparable information in the cybersecurity context with regard to the determination of materiality, an organizations ability to monitor third parties, unintended effects on patient safety, and coordination with existing state and federal law. Triggering Determination  Cybersecurity disclosures are of a conceptually different nature than many other types of disclosures required by the Commission. In considering whether disclosure should be triggered upon discovery or upon a determination of a material incident, the FAH appreciates the Commissions recognition that disclosure based on a materiality determination is the more practical trigger; however, materiality in the cybersecurity context can be more subjective than the principle of materiality to a shareholders total mix of information otherwise prevalent throughout federal securities law. When considering the impact of a cybersecurity incident, a company may, in some instances, be able to quickly determine that an incident may have a material effect from a regulatory perspective, but unlike other more bright line material disclosures affecting an investors total mix of information (e.g., the resignation of company executives or disclosure of litigation), the determination of whether a cybersecurity incident may be material could take an extended period of time as the assessment of overall impact usually takes place during and sometimes well after the incident is remediated. As a result, in complying with the Proposed Rule, registrants could have to decide whether to disclose a cybersecurity event without the benefit of having any available information with which investors may use to make informed decisions. 1 87 Fed. Reg 16,595 (Mar. 23, 2022). 3 It is unlikely that a company, despite potential ability to identify an incident as material, would simultaneously have adequate material information to disclose to investors, such as the nature and magnitude of the incident, financial impact, or anticipated vulnerabilities or regulatory consequences. For this reason, it also will be impractical for a company to retrospectively consider any immaterial incidents to determine if they are material in the aggregate on an ongoing basis. Likewise, it is impractical for a company to continually reassess its prior determination that an incident was immaterial. The proposed requirement to continually reassess prior incidents or disclose incidents that become material in the aggregate imposes an undue burden on companies that have appropriately handled incidents as they arise to continually reconsider their prior determinations regarding any individual incident  resources with which FAH registrant members may better serve their investors and patients through efficient and quality patient care. Our registrant members appreciate and work to follow the Commissions 2011 and 2018 interpretive guidance concerning reporting of cyber incidents under existing regulation. Compared to this existing guidance, the Commission now contends that the Proposed Rule will allow more comparable disclosures for consideration by investors than current disclosure practices. To the extent the Commission or investors perceive a disparity of disclosure, they observe the disparity inherent in cybersecurity incidents. Incidents may vary greatly in nature, scope, and magnitude of individuals impacted  imposing a four day reporting window will not actualize information for companies they are not yet in a position to have, particularly if an incident is ongoing. The inclusion of requested line items for investor comparison will not cause companies to possess information to disclose for such items even with a companys diligent efforts. Therefore, although the FAH agrees with the spirit of desiring easier comparison for investors, premature disclosures in the cybersecurity space may actually detract from the effectiveness of the disclosure requirement by providing an excess of inconsequential information. In addition, such premature disclosures are likely to cause more confusing and disparate information, not less, due to the lack of visibility companies themselves may have within the short reporting window. Relationship with Vendors  In reference to a companys disclosure obligations, the Commission proposes to define the term cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.2 It further defines information systems as information resources, owned or used by the registrant. (emphasis added).3 Our members utilize third party vendors, such as electronic medical record and similar service providers, relevant to their daily operations. These registrant members generally have less visibility into the security status of these third parties than their internal systems, further confusing any potential materiality determination under the Proposed Rule. Our registrant members cannot always discern when an incident may have occurred or is still in process on information systems used, but not owned, by the respective organization. Any ability to make a  2 87 Fed. Reg. 16,601 (Mar. 23, 2022). 3 Id.  4  materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident on information systems owned by a third party will depend on what the system owner is contractually required to disclose and the required timeframes associated with that disclosure. Although, depending on the nature of the services provided, FAH members may have agreements with third party system owners requiring upstream reporting of cybersecurity incidents, the timing and nature of such reporting is designed to comply with existing regulatory requirements and may not align with the disclosure timing imposed by the Proposed Rule. Even if there were such alignment, third party vendors may have varying views of what constitutes a material reportable incident.  Further, the vast majority of our registrant members vendors are not registrants themselves who would be subject to the Proposed Rule; consequently, under the Proposed Rule, our members may experience insufficient vendor reporting under existing agreements, as vendors would likely be reluctant to disclose information to our registrant members who would then be obligated to publicly disclose details of incidents such vendors may or may not otherwise be obligated to disclose to state or federal authorities, or the public at large. A registrant may find it particularly difficult to obtain this information from a privately held information systems provider, whose resources may be stretched thin as it responds to an incident, potentially resulting in misinformation to the registrant and ultimately to the investors. This potential lack of transparency between hospitals and health systems and their vendors may result in inadequate information on which our members otherwise rely to provide patient care.  Effect on Patient Care  Of particular concern to our members is the Commissions proposed four business day reporting window, requiring disclosure of details of an organizations cybersecurity incident regardless of whether such incidents remain ongoing or have yet to be remediated. As written, an organization would be required to disclose a potentially active cybersecurity incident, which may be unduly burdensome to an organizations limited resources while it works to address the active incident and may adversely impact the outcome of the remediation effort. In addition to the lack of visibility inherent in disclosures under the proposed reporting window, disclosure of ongoing incidents that have not yet been remediated discloses an organizations active vulnerability that may be further taken advantage of by bad actors. Such actors will be told, in real time, that their actions are having a material effect, emboldening them to continue their attack or deploy the same techniques on a secondary target. This risk is too great and significantly undermines the intended goals of such disclosure. The proposed disclosure of a health systems active vulnerability may adversely impact its ability to fully focus on quickly restoring critical systems that have a direct impact on providing care to patients. A cybersecurity incident in the hospital or health system context may involve sensitive patient health information. In the event of an incident, our members need the ability to preserve flexibility and resources to protect and mitigate risk to such sensitive information and cannot provide the level of detail required by the Proposed Rule regarding incidents that have not yet been remediated at the risk of placing their patients information in greater vulnerability.   5  Alignment with Existing State and Federal Law  While the FAH appreciates the Commissions desire to provide greater transparency to investors, we urge the Commission to consider that its Proposed Rule does not exist in a vacuum. Cybersecurity incidents, including breach notification requirements, are already the focus of both federal regulatory oversight and state law. Although the Commission has recognized in the Proposed Rule that organizations are subject to other reporting requirements and exceptions, it asserts that there is a possibility a registrant would be required to disclose [an] incident on Form 8 K even though it could delay incident reporting under a particular state law under the belief that [i]t is critical to investor protection and well functioning, orderly, and efficient markets that investors promptly receive information regarding material cybersecurity incidents.4 This presumption diminishes the value of critical infrastructure both at the federal and state levels and ignores the interagency cooperation that exists in the evolving cyber environment. In addition to other federal laws, HIPAA has its own incident reporting requirements and definitions, including materiality thresholds for disclosures to government authorities, individuals, and media agencies. Other federal agencies, as well as state law enforcement have certain authority to investigate cybersecurity incidents and pursue the bad actors involved. As such, HIPAA and certain other state and federal laws allow a covered entity to delay reporting an incident if the entity is working with law enforcement to investigate the cybersecurity incident. Requiring registrants to report a cybersecurity incident under the Proposed Rule while an active law enforcement investigation is underway would conflict with the intent of HIPAAs reporting delay and may adversely affect law enforcements investigation of a cybersecurity incident and apprehension of the responsible bad actors. Although the FAH believes in the value of informed investors to an efficient market, we question whether the proposed reporting requirements should be preeminent to the rights of individuals whose information is actually affected by an incident or the pursuit of protecting organizations and individuals locally and nationwide via investigation of the perpetrators of an incident. Any rulemaking by the Commission should allow registrants to delay reporting a cybersecurity incident in line with HIPAA and other applicable state and federal law, or where requested by the Attorney General, in order to balance the need for timely disclosure with the pursuit and prosecution of malicious actors. Management, Strategy, and Governance Information to be Disclosed  Value of the Information Disclosed  Under the Proposed Rule, the Commission would amend Form 10 K to require disclosure of (i) a registrants policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, (ii) a registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks, and (iii) managements role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies, as well as propose Items 106(b) and (c) and 407 of Regulation S K, requiring disclosure of whether an organization has certain types of policies, procedures, and governance concerning cybersecurity risks. The Proposed Rule asserts the Commissions view that a  4 87 Fed. Reg. 16,597 (Mar. 23, 2022). 6  companys disclosures concerning its cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance practices would allow investors to.evaluate a registrants risk management and governance practices regarding those risks, and better inform their investment and voting decisions and that such disclosures can improve an investors understanding of the registrants cybersecurity risk profile.5  FAH registrant members are concerned about, and committed to, protecting their information systems and digital assets from cybersecurity threats, as well as providing investors a clear understanding of that commitment from a risk management and governance perspective. However, the required risk management and strategy disclosures should balance improving an investors understanding of an organizations risk profile with the risk of a bad actors understanding of the same risk profile. The proposed requirements for an organization to disclose specific policy types and describe its programs for risk assessment and incident detection may provide a road map for bad actors to easily accessible information on potential targets and the general means by which its malicious actions may go undetected or otherwise cause the most damage. Even where an organization is not required to disclose specific security controls, the existence or absence of certain risk management procedures or governance may allow bad actors a basis on which to target a particular organization. Such misinformed assumptions by malicious actors could make a specific organization more vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, the Commission should alternatively consider requiring that such disclosures provide the registrant companys overall framework for cybersecurity risk management and governance, without providing unnecessary detail of specific policies and procedures or composition of the companys cybersecurity risk management team. The Commission contends that research has not suggested evidence that detailed cybersecurity risk disclosures lead to more attacks, recognizing, however, that the Proposed Rule would require more detailed disclosures than the current rules such that the referenced research is not generally applicable to the proposed reporting requirements. Although the Commission may be comfortable that it has no reason to believe more disclosure may lead to more risk, the FAH is concerned with the absence of evidence under the current rules as a basis on which to assume the safety of more detailed disclosures under the Proposed Rule. Disproportionate Representation of Public Health Systems  In addition to the potential harm for all organizations required to disclose sensitive information regarding their risk management procedures and governance, our registrant members in particular may face disproportionate attention in the health care industry. Our registrant members as compared to their privately held counterparts, will be required to disclose particulars of their cybersecurity policies and procedures, providing additional emphasis on such registrants as targets for a bad actor looking to infiltrate a health system. This disparity may discourage privately held health systems considering registration, thereby reducing optionality for investors seeking to direct resources within the healthcare industry.  5 87 Fed. Reg. 16,594, 16,599 (Mar. 23, 2022). 7  Request for Alternative Structure for Hospitals and Health Systems Although the FAH believes the Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance provides adequate cybersecurity reporting to investors via disclosure obligations for our registrant members, in light of the points above, the FAH respectfully requests the Commission to consider the following in any further rulemaking activity related to cybersecurity:  • Engage in interagency coordination and ensure alignment with those federal agencies that are better suited to online defense, law enforcement, and national security; • Carve out entities subject to compliance with HIPAA or other laws imposing similar reporting of cybersecurity incidents, or, in the alternative, provide greater particularity for determinations of materiality, such as alignment with existing regulatory frameworks, including an entitys obligation to disclose certain incidents pursuant to HIPAA; • Limit an organizations obligation to report a cybersecurity incident to one affecting systems owned by such organization, given the inability to control reporting of privately held vendors, as well as provide safe harbor protection for reporting cybersecurity events affecting resources that are used but not owned by the registrant; • Tie the incident disclosure trigger to a reasonable number of days following remediation of a material event rather than only a determination of materiality in order to allow the organization to focus its resources on remediation and recovery efforts, protect the organization from further vulnerability, and allow appropriate time for all facts and circumstances impacting materiality to be identified; • Align the ability to delay disclosure of incidents in circumstances allowed under existing state and federal law, so as not to impede investigation by appropriate supervisory authorities and law enforcement; and • Reduce an organizations obligation to disclose particulars of its cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance in favor of a general description of risks and mitigation contemplated under the current rules, so as not to aid bad actors in targeting and attacking registrants on the basis of such disclosures. ****************** The FAH appreciates the Commissions dedication toward protecting investors and your consideration of our comments. We look forward to continued collaboration with the Commission to implement effective policies that assist the health care industry in meeting the challenges of the evolving cyber landscape.

Countryman, Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 0609 Security and Exchange Commission proposed rule regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File S7 09 22 Dear Secretary Countryman: Tenable Holdings, Inc. submits these comments in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) proposed rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure,1 (the proposed rule). Tenable appreciates the opportunity to submit comments and believes that the commentary offered will be helpful to the SEC in providing additional information from the cybersecurity industrys perspective on several key elements of the proposed rule. We write in overall support of the proposed rule, with more detailed comments to ensure the final rule meets the SECs stated goals. Tenable is headquartered in Columbia, Maryland. Approximately 40,000 organizations around the globe rely on Tenable to understand and reduce cyber risk. As the creator of Nessus®, Tenable extended its expertise in vulnerabilities to deliver the worlds first platform to see and secure any digital asset on any computing platform. Tenable customers include approximately 60 percent of the Fortune 500, approximately 40 percent of the Global 2000, and large government agencies. We are supportive of efforts to identify and promote the adoption of cybersecurity best practices, information sharing, and standards throughout the global community. Tenable commends the SEC for its initiative and ongoing efforts to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity, and strongly supports the SECs proposed rule that will require public companies to disclose their policies and procedures for 1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf 2 identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, and the board of directors cybersecurity expertise.2 We believe it is important that investors know whether a registrants board of directors has an oversight role regarding cybersecurity governance, including its oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks. Tenable also supports the SECs proposal to require disclosures of cyber incidents with the specific feedback and input included in comments submitted by the Cybersecurity Coalition (attached to this submission).  We recognize the importance of providing decision useful and relevant information to investors to facilitate informed investment decisions. Requiring increased transparency around cybersecurity risk management practices is critically important for shareholders to make informed decisions about their investments. Shareholders should have access to information about whether public companies are taking action to address cybersecurity risks and the negative impacts of cybersecurity breaches. Cybersecurity breaches can damage a companys financial condition. In addition to the costs of remediation from a cyberattack and loss of customers, revenue and reputation, there are risks of shareholder lawsuits, customer lawsuits, increases in insurance premiums and increased scrutiny from external auditors and regulators. Additional consequences of cyber failures include distraction of management, which can result in new problems unrelated to the breach; the trigger of customer audits of a companys cybersecurity defenses, which can lead to the involvement of outside counsel and other third parties; and significant expenses, among others.3 In addition, the proposed disclosure requirements would dramatically improve our cybersecurity preparedness as a nation. We believe that requiring greater transparency of cyber risk practices and oversight forces companies to treat cybersecurity risk as business risk, leading to stronger cybersecurity governance and accountability among corporate leaders and boards and, ultimately, more effective cybersecurity. We strongly believe that this proposal serves as the most significant driver 2 This was a key recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to strengthen the broader cyber ecosystem, https://www.solarium.gov/report. 3 Tenable General Counsel Steve Riddick, Harvard Business Review Article, https://hbr.org/2021/09/the sec is serious about cybersecurity is your company 3 for inciting corporate leadership to pay attention and establish baseline cybersecurity practices and processes. Detailed below are Tenables responses to specific questions as numbered within the proposed rule. Question 17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? We recommend the adoption of Item 106(b) and (c) with the following changes bolded and in brackets: 1) item 106(b)(i): The registrant has a cybersecurity risk assessment program [that continuously assesses cybersecurity risks and implements safeguards designed to control those risks] and if so, provide a description of such program. Tenable believes it would be useful for investors to know if a registrants cybersecurity risk assessment program includes continuous assessments of cybersecurity risks vs. periodic assessments of cybersecurity risks. If a registrant only assesses cybersecurity risks on a periodic basis, such as once per month or once per quarter, the organization is at greater risk of an exploitation than if a registrant continuously assesses cybersecurity risks. Todays threat landscape is highly dynamic and requires organizations to continuously assess and defend against new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors and cyber criminals. We have also observed dramatic decreases between when a new vulnerability is discovered and when it is leveraged in widespread attacks. Periodic assessments of cybersecurity risks would significantly inhibit an organizations ability to respond quickly and effectively to remediate or mitigate these threats. In addition, it would be useful for investors to know whether the registrants risk assessment program includes actions to control or mitigate those risks. As stated above, there are significant costs associated with the remediation from a cyberattack and 4 cybersecurity breaches can damage a companys financial condition. Knowing whether a registrant has plans to control or mitigate cybersecurity risks is necessary for investors to make an informed decision about their investment. It would also be useful for organizations to communicate and track their cybersecurity risk profile using specific key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide additional transparency to investors. Cybersecurity risk should be another metric used by the financial services community to manage risk and incorporate into strategic decisions. Understanding an organizations cybersecurity risk profile could also validate whether their current security measures and controls are implemented and working properly or identify gaps and areas of improvement. 2) Item 106(b)(ii): The registrant engages assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program [and a description of the class of services and solutions those third parties are providing]. We recommend Item 106(b)(ii) also require the registrant to disclose the services and solutions provided by third parties. This information will provide investors access to important information about the registrants cybersecurity risk assessment program they may not otherwise have access to in order to make informed investment decisions. Tenable believes Item 106(b) and (c) with Tenables proposed changes support the intent of the proposed rule to provide decision useful information concerning whether and how a registrant is managing cybersecurity risks [which] could impact an investors return on investment.  Question 21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? Yes. A registrant should have to explicitly state if they have not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures. As stated above, cybersecurity breaches can damage a companys financial condition. In addition to the 5 costs of remediation from a cyberattack and loss of customers, revenue and reputation, there are risks of loss of proprietary information, shareholder lawsuits, customer lawsuits, increases in insurance premiums and increased scrutiny from external auditors and regulators, among other things. There are indirect consequences to cyber failures as well; cyberattacks can distract management and divert resources, resulting in new problems unrelated to the breach; they can also trigger customer audits of a companys cybersecurity defenses, which can lead to the involvement of outside counsel and other third parties, and significant added expenses. If an organization does not have adequate cybersecurity controls and defenses, shareholders have a right to know and factor in that risk to their investment decisions.  Question 22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? In general, Tenable believes that the disclosures specified in Item 106 regarding a registrants policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, a registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks, and managements role and relevant expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies would be beneficial in promoting transparency. Additionally, this transparency should provide an incentive for the registrant to develop, implement, and maintain cybersecurity governance, policies and procedures in line with industry best practices and standards. 6 However, per Item 106(b)(vi), Tenable believes registrants should only be required to disclose at a high level whether [p]revious cybersecurity incidents informed changes in the registrants governance, policies and procedures, or technologies. Requiring the disclosure of specific details about how registrants are changing their programs in response to breaches to protect their enterprise could undermine the cybersecurity defenses of the registrant and make the registrant more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Tenable does not believe other disclosures required under Item 106 would undermine a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts. While there may be incremental risks associated with a registrants disclosures regarding their lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity, we feel the risk to the registrant is outweighed by the risk to a potential investor who is not able to assess a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures. Question 23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? We do not think the SEC should exempt any categories of registrants from proposed Item 106(b), including smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs. All organizations are potential targets of threat actors, who typically cast a wide net and are indiscriminate in their threat activities. Further, it is often smaller organizations that have implemented the weakest cybersecurity defenses and are least mature in their basic cyber hygiene protections, such as regularly patching software, ensuring devices are properly configured, using multi factor authentication and enforcing least privileges to systems and data. Increased transparency with respect to companies cybersecurity risk management is valuable to 7 investors when making investment decisions, regardless of filer type. Question 24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or ABS issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? We do not think the SEC should significantly delay compliance with Item 106, but instead provide for a period of transition for compliance. Cybersecurity risk assessment programs should be a foundational and strategic function of all organizations, no matter the age, size or industry. A decision to delay compliance would signal that cybersecurity risk assessment is only relevant to specific segments of companies, when the reality is that all organizations are potential targets by threat actors. It is to the benefit of companies, their customers and their shareholders to ensure that adequate cybersecurity controls and defenses are implemented without exception or the ability to delay compliance due to a technicality. Question 25. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (Board leadership structure and role in oversight) with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross references in Item 106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? We do not think disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlaps with disclosure required under Item 407(h) with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks. Rather, the two disclosure requirements would supplement each other. Item 8 407(h) of Regulation S K focuses on board governance generally, while certain proposed disclosure in Item 106 focuses on board governance with regard to cybersecurity. If registrants are allowed to hyperlink or cross reference to their 407(h) disclosure, it will place less emphasis on cybersecurity and counter the intent of the proposed rule. In addition, registrants might take that opportunity to provide less detail on their cybersecurity governance policies than is intended by the proposed rule. While board oversight of cyber risks is only one piece of proposed Item 106, it is an important one. Allowing cross references could relegate cyber oversight to a laundry list disclosure of the boards oversight function generally without giving investors the detailed information they need to understand if a board is educated and engaged on cyber risk.  Tenable hopes that this input will be helpful to the SEC in highlighting the elements of the proposed rule that we believe should be modified or left intact to achieve the SECs stated goals, while becoming more consistent with cybersecurity standards and best practices, especially as they relate to cybersecurity policies and practices.

(Proposal)3 Nareit, The Roundtable, and their members have long understood the critical importance of communicating accurate and material business and financial information, including material information about cybersecurity incidents and policies, to real estate investment trust (REIT) and other commercial real estate investors. We have also strongly supported efforts to promote understanding among commercial real estate participants of the nature of cybersecurity risks and policies to prevent and mitigate such risks. Perspective on the Proposal  The Roundtable and Nareit have been strong supporters of policies that promote industry reporting to the federal government on significant cybersecurity incidents. The industry has also worked successfully since 2003 with federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies 1 Nareit serves as the worldwide representative voice for real estate investment trusts (REITs)1 and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in U.S. income producing real estate. Nareits members are REITs and other publicly traded real estate companies throughout the world that own, operate, and finance income producing real estate, as well as those firms and individuals who advise, study, and service those businesses.  2 The Real Estate Roundtable and its members lead an industry that generates more than 20% of Americas gross national product, employs more than 9 million people, and produces nearly two thirds of the taxes raised by local governments for essential public services. Our members are senior real estate industry executives from the U.S.s leading income producing real property owners, managers, and investors; the elected heads of Americas leading real estate trade organizations; as well as the key executives of the major financial services companies involved in financing, securitizing, or investing in income producing properties. 3 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 11038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 2  including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  to mitigate the risks associated with terrorism and criminal activity on a broad array of physical and cyber threats. The real estate industry has also played an important role in fostering information sharing practices between the U.S. government and the business community by creating the Real Estate Information Sharing and Analysis Center (RE ISAC), a public private information sharing partnership between the U.S. commercial facilities sector.4 The RE ISAC, has been designated by the Department of Homeland Security as the conduit for the commercial real estate industry for sharing information about potential physical and cyber security threats and vulnerabilities to help protect commercial facilities and the people who use them. Nareit and The Roundtable are broadly supportive of the SECs efforts to ensure that investors receive accurate and comparable material information regarding company cyber risk management and incidents. However, based on member feedback and analysis of the Proposal, we have a number of concerns arising from the detailed, granular reporting that would be required by the Proposal, and the rigid incident reporting deadlines, which members fear may unintentionally exacerbate cybersecurity risks for issuers and impose burdens unjustified by obvious benefits. Executive Summary   It is vital to harmonize SEC reporting requirements with other federal and state cyber incident reporting requirements.   The Commissions proposed 72 hour reporting window should incorporate flexibility for a reporting delay to accommodate other law enforcement and other contingencies.   Registrants should not be required to report detailed descriptions of their internal cybersecurity gameplans, which could compromise them in any number of ways.  The prescriptive requirements for disclosing risk management, strategy, and governance regarding cybersecurity risk are burdensome and unjustified.   4 The RE ISAC, supported jointly by The Real Estate Roundtable and Nareit, has been designated by the Department of Homeland Security as the conduit for the commercial real estate industry for sharing information about potential physical and cyber security threats and vulnerabilities to help protect commercial facilities and the people who use them, as memorialized in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between the RE ISAC and the Department of Homeland Security was executed on April 2, 2015.   Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 3  Detailed Discussion  Harmonization with other Reporting Requirements.  Over the years, The Roundtable and Nareit have encouraged federal agency officials and lawmakers to work toward harmonizing duplicative and overly burdensome information security requirements that impact regulated businesses, including REITs and other commercial real estate firms. We believe that streamlining cybersecurity reporting requirements benefits real estate companies and their investors alike, by enabling firms to efficiently address cybersecurity matters and providing clarity to their investors, who are often confused by conflicting reporting to multiple governmental agencies. For this reason, we respectfully suggest that as the SEC moves forward with its Cybersecurity Proposal, it work to ensure that its cybersecurity disclosure rules do not conflict with other state, federal, and (in several cases) international reporting requirements. Complying with duplicative and potentially conflicting cybersecurity reporting requirements is not only costly to companies, but may divert corporate resources needed to monitor on going cyber risks and respond to a cyber attack.  We believe that the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 20225, which will require critical infrastructure organizations to report cyber attacks within 72 hours of reasonably believing that an incident has occurred, is particularly relevant to the SECs Cybersecurity Proposal. The Act, which is intended to provide the federal government with a better understanding of the nations cyber threats and facilitate a coordinated national response to ransomware attacks, will require CISAs Director to issue regulations covering, among other matters, the manner, timing and form of reports and the necessary steps to take for information preservation. We believe that it is important to ensure that the requirements of the SECs Cybersecurity Proposal do not conflict with the requirements of this new law.  For these reasons, we urge the SEC to ensure that its cybersecurity disclosure framework is coordinated with other federal, state and local cybersecurity reporting requirements, policies and procedures. We also suggest that the SEC and other policymaking bodies engage in additional collaborative efforts with industry groups with the goal of streamlining corporate disclosure requirements arising from cyber incidents, to ensure that issuers are not distracted by unnecessary requirements and that investors are not confused by duplicative and confusing reporting.  5 On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (the Act), creating new requirements for organizations operating in critical infrastructure sectors to report to the federal government certain cyber incidents and related ransom payments. The Act is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (H.R. 2471). This Act reflects a renewed regulatory focus on cybersecurity risks as cyber threats intensify. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 4  Nareit and The Roundtable look forward to working constructively with the SEC and other federal and state agencies to find a balanced approach to providing investors with meaningful, material cybersecurity risk disclosure and protecting American businesses from cyber attacks while not imposing burdensome regulations on the industry. Reporting Window Should Accommodate Law Enforcement and other Contingencies. The Roundtable and Nareit support reasonably timed and flexible cyber incident reporting to the relevant federal, state and local governmental entities. However, based on discussions with our members, we believe that the Proposals rigidly conceived four business day window to disclose material cybersecurity incidents raises several concerns for REITs and other issuers. Of greatest concern, the Proposal would not provide any flexibility to delay incident reporting because of an ongoing internal or external investigation, including one directed by federal or state law enforcement officials, related to the cybersecurity incident. As an initial matter, upon discovering a cyber incident, many companies may not immediately have comprehensive awareness of the facts and implications of the breach, particularly in the common circumstance of a rapidly evolving cyber incident taking place over several days. Companies may also not be in a position to assess the materiality of the breach within 72 hours, because it may need additional time to determine the nature and magnitude of the attack and the implications for the companys operations. Requiring premature disclosure in such circumstances would effectively force many companies to file a series of sequentially updated reports to the SEC, many of limited utility to investors, or worse, confusing to them. Moreover, diverting critical resources to continuously update disclosure may diminish the effectiveness of the actual response and mitigation efforts. Further, our members also point out that requiring a company undergoing a ransomware attack to report the incident prematurely could exacerbate injury to the company, especially if the disclosure occurs when an intruder is still present in the companys network. We are also concerned that requiring issuers to make a rapid fire, though incomplete or inconclusive, cyber disclosure based on fragmentary information may also expose issuers to additional liability and reputational and litigation risk. Many REITs and other landlords lease space to federal and state government agencies, including some with national security missions. These leasing arrangements are often subject to cybersecurity monitoring and incident reporting regimes that are specific to the nature of the facility, the government tenant, or to the location. Because the Proposals rigid reporting requirements are not coordinated with other governmental reporting regimes, these REITs and other landlords are likely to be confronted with reporting requirements that are, at best duplicative and burdensome, and at worst, conflicting and irreconcilable.   Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 5  We also have concerns that the requirement that issuers make a disclosure to the SEC when … a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate is vague and unworkable. The process of assessing materiality of a series of prior (and perhaps current) incidents in the aggregate would pose significant burdens, forcing companies to expend considerable resources to continuously reevaluate prior events. Moreover, some have raised concerns that reclassification of a prior incident as material in hindsight could give rise to the perception that the issuer failed to properly assess materiality upon prior discovery. In light of these concerns, we urge the SEC to incorporate flexibility in the 72 hour reporting window set forth in the Proposal. At minimum, the SECs proposed cybersecurity rule should include a workable procedure for providing an issuer with a reporting delay upon request, when accompanied by a request from a law enforcement or national security agency.6 Moreover, the reporting window should also include procedures to accommodate circumstances when disclosure within 72 hours would exacerbate injury to the company and/or its shareholders. We also urge the SEC to reconsider the requirements related to reporting prior immaterial cyber incidents, which we believe impose burdens and potential liabilities, without benefit. Registrants should not be required to report detailed descriptions of their internal cybersecurity gameplans, which could compromise them in any number of ways. Both of our organizations support disclosure of relevant and material information about issuer cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures. However, we have significant concerns with the provisions of the Proposal that would require issuers to make detailed disclosure of their policies, procedures, and methods for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, because such disclosures may lead to a degradation of their cybersecurity programs and expose their companies to a range of risks posed by a range of bad actors.  In particular, we believe that issuers should not be required to disclose sensitive details about their cybersecurity monitoring and response programs in SEC filings. Such disclosures may heighten exposure to cyber attack, or otherwise compromise enterprise response. We also note that many issuers rely on third party cybersecurity experts and vendors to assist in the development and maintenance of their cybersecurity policies and procedures. Requiring detailed disclosure of these proprietary systems and programs may be contrary to contractual obligations to protect the intellectual property, or other rights of these third parties. 6 We note that the Exchange Act currently recognizes circumstances when national security concerns temporarily exempt issuers from certain reporting requirements. 15 U.S.C. 78m (b)(3)(A). Because issuers typically experience cyber incidents in pressured time frames, we recommend that the SEC develop a practical procedure that incorporates this principle as it moves forward with its Cybersecurity rulemaking. Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 6  Proposals Required Disclosure of Cyber Risk Management, Strategy & Governance is Burdensome and unjustified. Nareit and The Roundtable agree with the SEC that REITs and commercial real estate issuers, together with all issuers, must have robust processes and internal controls in place to manage and report on cybersecurity risk and incidents, together with board competence to oversee these processes. But we are concerned about the highly prescriptive nature of the requirements set forth in the Proposal and the one size fits all presumption that the prescriptive requirements will be appropriate for all industry sectors. As an initial matter, we are concerned that the Proposals requirements that issuers disclose policies, procedures, and granular information about management roles and responsibilities creates significant pressure to conform internal processes and controls in a manner that may be inappropriate for an any given issuer and of no material benefit to the issuers investors. We believe that disclosing this level of detail does not benefit investors and is likely to be misleading to investors. We are similarly concerned that the requirements that issuers disclose how—and when—the board considers cybersecurity risks in detail is not beneficial to investors and may, again, provide useful information to cyber criminals. We have similar concerns about the Proposals requirement that issuers disclose the cybersecurity expertise of directors and management. We fear that this will pressure companies to hire cyber experts of unproven value to the company, simply to check the box. We note that the Proposal suggests that companies should consider whether directors, or relevant managers, have obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity, which raises additional concerns. Because there is no commonly accepted credentialling, or credentialling body, for a cyber expert, the presence or absence of such a designated expert may mislead investors. Further, as many others point out, there is a limited supply of cybersecurity experts of whatever credentials, suggesting that this requirement inevitably sets many companies up for immediate failure.  Conclusion  Nareit and The Roundtable appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments on this important topic and stand ready to work directly with the Commission as it moves forward to develop a clear, transparent and secure set of cybersecurity disclosure rules. We trust that the Commission will find our comments helpful.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Release No. 34 94382; File No. S7 09 22 Dear Secretary Countryman:  Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft, we, or our) is providing this letter in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the SEC or the Commission) proposed rule, Cyber Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (the Release or the Proposal). Microsoft supports the Commissions broad objective of enhancing and standardizing disclosure regarding cybersecurity incidents, risk management, and governance. The many benefits of information technologys accelerating adoption into company operations come with inherent risks that are the rightful concern of investors. Because of the unique nature of the interconnected technology ecosystem, however, these particular areas of concern, above perhaps any other, demand careful consideration of a broad range of interdependencies and prioritization of efforts to protect the security of our national and global digital ecosystems. As a result, we believe there should be a clear, consistent framework and obligation for private sector organizations to collaborate with the government and other stakeholders when they are impacted by significant cybersecurity incidents. We see appropriate transparency and information sharing as essential to the protection of not just Microsofts security environment but also to strengthen coordinated efforts among the broader security community. We believe public disclosure to investors through SEC filings should be structured in a manner consistent with these broader objectives. Correspondingly, we believe it is imperative  for national security interests and, ultimately, for the investing publics interests  for any rule to be closely coordinated and harmonized with other laws and regulations governing cybersecurity incident reporting and information sharing. We encourage the SEC to work closely with other interested government agencies to establish a unified approach to incident response reporting and disclosure and to achieve shared objectives and priorities.  2  I. Item 1.05 of Form 8 K  The SEC has proposed adding a new Item 1.05 to Form 8 K. Item 1.05 would require a registrant to provide disclosure within four business days of determining it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Although we understand the Commissions desire to maintain consistency with its established four business day window for current reporting of events covered by Form 8 K, we urge it again to consider certain unique characteristics of cyber events in how the four business day window will apply. The Commission should explicitly allow issuers to manage the timing of a Form 8 K filing, even after a materiality determination, when compelling conditions exist such that premature disclosure would result in greater harm to the company, its investors, or the national digital ecosystem.  Risk of providing inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information during dynamic and ongoing evaluations of cybersecurity incidents  Discovery that a cybersecurity incident has occurred initiates a complex and dynamic forensic process to analyze and understand the nature of the attack and attacker, to understand the type of data that might be affected, to assess any operational impact, and to rapidly deploy any potentially mitigating defenses. When this work starts, there is often very little detailed information available. An incident investigation and response effort can last for several months; understanding of it will evolve over that time, and threat actor behavior can change significantly throughout the course of an incident. Modern threat actor behavior also often involves a complex attack chain to overcome current cybersecurity best practices. These attack chains may involve supply chain or third party compromise, social engineering, or insider assisted components. Many investigations are dependent on the collection and analysis of forensic data that may reside outside the boundary of the affected party. As facts are gathered and analyzed, early Form 8 K disclosures made in good faith and based on the best available information may turn out to have been incorrect. Therefore, even when a company may be able to determine a cyber incident is material relatively early in the investigation and response process, an early stage Form 8 K could contain information that proves to be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. Allowing for investigations to be more well  developed before a Form 8 K is filed would result in more accurate and more decision  useful information for investors. Risk of alerting a hostile threat actor Due to their inherently adversarial nature, cybersecurity incidents are unlike any other item for which Form 8 K disclosure is mandated. Hostile threat actors can include criminal networks and nation states who are sophisticated enough to attack multiple organizations simultaneously and react quickly to new information. While an incident is ongoing, the threat actor may still be active in the registrants compromised  3  environment. Even after a company has remediated an incident, the threat actor may still be similarly exploiting other companies, entities, or government agencies. If Form 8 K disclosure were to alert the threat actor before the incident is remediated, then the registrant or others continuing to be simultaneously impacted by a widespread attack may face increased risks different from the initial incident. For example, the threat actor could leverage alternative tactics or additional exploits to more effectively mask intrusions, plant false flag information, destroy indicators of compromise, accelerate data exfiltration, disrupt data integrity, or cause additional harm to the registrant or others across the ecosystem. Further, even if a threat actor has not already compromised multiple organizations, being made aware that its activity has been identified at one company could result in a threat actor accelerating its use of tactics or exploits across the entire digital ecosystem, before other targeted parties could prepare defenses (e.g., before patches for vulnerabilities could be made available or widely implemented), or a before coordinated response with cybersecurity agencies or law enforcement could be established. As noted in Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD 41), certain cyber incidents that have significant impacts on an entity, our national security, or the broader economy require a unique approach to response efforts. These significant cybersecurity incidents demand unity of effort within the Federal Government and especially close coordination between the public and private sectors. Coordinated responses across multiple government agencies, at the international, federal, state, and local level, and involving several companies could be disrupted and undermined by premature public disclosure, making the digital ecosystem less safe. Companies may also be less willing to share information about cyber incidents if they believe it could result in another company incurring a Form 8 K disclosure obligation that would undermine response efforts. Principles based Form 8 K disclosure; law enforcement exception  For these reasons, we believe the SEC should consider alternatives to the four business day reporting period. We recommend the SEC adopt a principles based Form 8 K disclosure requirement, allowing management to exercise discretion and, as appropriate, coordination with cybersecurity, national security, and law enforcement authorities regarding the appropriate timing of filing the Form 8 K. If the Commission decides to adopt a four business day reporting period (or other set reporting period), we believe that the rule must allow for an exception when the registrant is informed by a cybersecurity, national security, or law enforcement agency that a delay of disclosure would serve national security interests or would allow law enforcement to more effectively disrupt or pursue apprehension of the perpetrator.  4  II. Definitions  Cybersecurity Incidents  The proposed rule defines cybersecurity incident as: An unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. We do not believe that an incident that jeopardizes a registrants information systems or information residing therein is an appropriate mandatory Form 8 K disclosure trigger. The Release notes that this definition is derived from PPD 41 and other comparable sources. We believe a key distinction between the objectives or purposes of many of those referenced sources, on the one hand, and SEC reporting, on the other , is that the former sources contemplate confidential reporting to support a law enforcement or national security response. The goal of such confidential reporting and agency response, among other things, is to prevent harm before it occurs. In those circumstances, real time confidential reporting when systems or information are jeopardized is appropriate and necessary. In contrast, we do not believe the same rationale exists for real time Form 8 K disclosure regarding cybersecurity incidents. While an incident may create significant risk of harm  i.e., it may jeopardize a registrants information systems or information — it may not result in harm because a threat actor could be contained, or a vulnerability patched before there is any material impact to the company. Just as Form 8 K does not mandate disclosure of potential material agreements or potential bankruptcies, we do not believe Form 8 K should mandate disclosure of an event that may never materially impact the company. We recommend that the SEC revise this definition so that Form 8 K disclosure is required where there is actual impact i.e., disclosure should be required only if the company is materially affected by a cybersecurity incident. III. Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents That Have Become Material in the Aggregate  The Release creates a requirement to provide disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. The Release notes that registrants should analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality. It does not, however, define what constitutes a series, what it means to be related, or what time period should be assessed. If this requirement is adopted, we believe additional clarity around these terms should be provided. Even if  5  additional clarity were provided, we believe this requirement would present significant challenges for companies and be of limited value to investors. A materiality analysis involves considerations that are different from the analysis conducted to scope, respond to, and remediate an incident. Performing an in depth materiality analysis of a single significant cybersecurity incident is a fact intensive and time consuming process, involving many internal and potentially external constituencies. The Proposal would create an ongoing materiality analysis requirement for every obviously immaterial, even trivial, cybersecurity incident that is arguably part of a series. There would be both significant practical challenges for some companies and limited value in the case of others.  First, a company would have to assess every cybersecurity incident in enough detail to determine whether it related to others or was part of a series. That alone could be a difficult, if not impossible, exercise for some organizations, in part because of the challenge of attribution. Where companies own information resources, they may not have sufficient expertise or resources to focus on tracking threat actors or otherwise determining whether incidents are related, instead prioritizing defensive, remediation, and response activities. Where registrants use information resources owned by others, they may be dependent on context from their providers, which may or may not focus resources on tracking threat actors or whether incidents are otherwise related. Furthering the challenge is that each incident may potentially be part of more than one series. Second, each incident that is determined to be part of a series would have to be evaluated to determine its significance and impact so the company could aggregate it into the overall materiality analysis. That would involve a detailed assessment by business, financial, cybersecurity, and legal resources for incidents that are clearly immaterial.  Third, the analysis for each incident in the series would have to be stitched together into an overall materiality analysis for each series. The overall analysis effort would be ongoing and have to track each incident as it evolves. That would require the gathering and monitoring of facts at a level that is unwarranted for immaterial events, which is in tension with the materiality threshold in the Proposal. The complexity and layered nature of these analyses would render any resulting disclosure of questionable value. Simultaneously, it would open the door for potential second guessing around how a company analyzed any group of events. Microsoft recommends not including this requirement in the final rule.   6 IV.  Cyber Expertise  The proposed rule amends Item 407 of Regulation S K to require disclosure regarding board members cyber expertise. This requirement is a significant expansion of Regulation S Ks Item 401(e)s existing disclosure obligation for companies to discuss the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the conclusion that the person should serve as a director for the registrant. Although the proposed disclosure creates no explicit obligation to have a cyber expert on a companys board, it does create implicit pressure to do so. The rule as proposed invites investors and other stakeholders to question boards with no or minimal cyber expertise among their members as to whether they are equipped to oversee cybersecurity risk. We are concerned that this trend of requiring disclosure of specific expertise will lead to boards being made up of specialists who will lack an overall picture of the business landscape. The best boards are comprised of highly accomplished generalists with deep intellect and acute critical thinking skills. As a board of directors strives to maintain a diverse set of experiences and attributes, it also expects that each member will be able to understand and contribute meaningfully to the oversight of the broad range of material business, risk, and regulatory issues their role requires them to oversee. Managements responsibility includes educating and communicating to the board in a way that enables effective oversight around these issues. As a result, specific areas of substantive expertise may be beneficial but not required among board members. No board should unduly rely on an expert; rather, it should ensure management, or the boards own outside resources, bridge any gaps and answer any questions until the board is satisfied that it, collectively, can effectively discharge its oversight duties.

CTA recognizes the SECs interest in ensuring shareholders have access to information regarding cybersecurity events and practices that can inform or undermine their investments in public companies. Indeed, the SEC has included cybersecurity within its disclosures regarding material risk for many years.3 However, the Proposed Rules purport to expand the nature and scope of these mandatory disclosures in ways that may undermine the cybersecurity practices and goals of public companies and infringe on the efforts of other agencies with operational cybersecurity missions—absent a well developed record to support these changes. The specific disclosures, such as the four day rule, would in some cases require public companies to prematurely disclose vulnerabilities principally for the sake of regulatory compliance rather than for a cybersecurity purpose. The premature public disclosure of a vulnerability before remediation, could have disastrous cybersecurity effects for the disclosing company as well as numerous other organizations, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Given the complicated set of challenges involved in cybersecurity disclosure, the SEC should take additional steps to solicit input and develop a more robust record prior to releasing revised proposed rules. Indeed, cybersecurity is exactly the type of complicated issue the SEC has indicated deserves public input—such as a public notice or hearing with informed testimony and evidence from cybersecurity professionals, as well as government agencies specifically charged with developing and implementing cybersecurity policy and ensuring security in the nations digital ecosystem including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Office of the National Cyber Director—prior to issuing a detailed proposed rule.4 This is an especially important step because other federal agencies are developing cybersecurity management, reporting and other best practices that the Proposed Rules may contradict.  Although the SEC held a roundtable that included some discussion of aspects of cybersecurity disclosure in 2014,5 the cybersecurity landscape has evolved significantly over the last eight years and federal reporting frameworks have evolved along with it. Coming at this time, the SECs disclosure requirement could be seen as prematurely wedging itself into established and evolving cybersecurity practices still in development throughout industry and the government, as discussed in the next section. To avoid such conflicts, CTA urges the SEC to solicit input from the widespread diaspora of stakeholders engaged on these issues outside the present notice  3 As 2011 SEC disclosure guidance notes, material information regarding cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents is required to be disclosed when necessary in order to make other required disclosures . . . as with other operational and financial risks, registrants should review, on an ongoing basis, the adequacy of their disclosure relating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.

This process should include additional engagement with critical infrastructure sectors and the SEC should provide a revised set of Proposed Rules for public comment.  Cyber Related Disclosure Should be Complementary to Industry Best Practices. Any SEC rule should complement—not contradict—established industry practices that support ongoing innovative cybersecurity risk management.6 Companies across the globe have collaboratively developed common approaches to identifying, managing and communicating risk, such as through use of the National Institute of Standards and Technologys (NISTs) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.7 Tools like these help public companies continually enhance their cybersecurity postures, respond to and recover from cyber incidents when they occur, through mechanisms that can be translated, tailored and adapted to meet evolving needs. In addition, industry itself has developed common practices to perform specific tasks through standards, such as the ETSI coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process.8  CTA acknowledges that there are situations where cybersecurity reporting requirements designed to protect our national critical infrastructure play an important role, especially if narrowly tailored to achieve their public policy aim. However, the Proposed Rules would require public companies to report a material cyber incident within four business days of a company determining such an incident has occurred,9 yet do not provide an exemption to this four day requirement to account for the needs of organizations working to remediate the threat, law enforcement or national security activities, nor do they account for companies working through CVD processes. Furthermore, the Proposed Rules would require reporting entities to disclose whether they have completed mitigation of the vulnerability in question, further risking exploitation of the vulnerability by bad actors. Timing needs can vary and critically impact CVD processes, which enable entities to collaboratively address security flaws without aiding malicious actors in additional exploitation of a vulnerability.10 Moreover, this four day requirement may conflict with reporting requirements at other agencies focused on operational cybersecurity, such as CISAs forthcoming rules on cyber incident reporting for  6 See, e.g., J. David Grossman and Mike Bergman, Coordinated Disclosure of Cyber Vulnerabilities is a Win for Consumers and Industry, Consumer Technology Association, https://cta.tech/Resources/Articles/2022/Coordinated Disclosure of Cyber Vulnerabilities is (last visited Apr. 28, 2022) (discussing industry practices and international standards with respect to cyber vulnerabilities disclosures) (Grossman Bergman Blog). 7 NIST, Cybersecurity Framework, https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework (last visited Apr. 28, 2022).  8 ETSI, Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, https://www.etsi.org/standards/coordinated vulnerability disclosure (last visited Apr. 28, 2022). 9 Proposed Rules at 16607. 10 Grossman Bergman Blog. 4 critical infrastructure.11 For these reasons, establishing a required timeline for disclosure would distract from, interfere with or could otherwise lead to incomplete information about an ongoing cyber incident. The proposed rules incident reporting obligations may also negatively impact critical cybersecurity information sharing practices, to the detriment of companies, their investors and the public. Following Presidential Decision Directive/NSC 63, many critical industries have established Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs).12 Information shared with industry and government is designed to help all promptly identify and mitigate significant security risks as identified by member companies. The proposed rule may have an unintended chilling effect on this information sharing. If subject to the Proposed Rules, ISAC members may now hesitate to characterize risks with the appropriate degree of severity, or share them at all, if their decision to share and characterize a risk as critical is later challenged if the company did not disclose a related incident as material. Particularly given the sophisticated, evolving threats faced by the U.S. government and the private sector partners on which it relies, agencies across the federal government should find ways to incentivize—not hinder—cyber threat information sharing. In addition, any rules regarding cybersecurity disclosure should not artificially distort the board appointment decisions of public companies in ways that may not provide meaningful information to shareholders. For example, the Proposed Rules would require companies to disclose whether any members of its board of directors have cybersecurity expertise and describe the nature of that expertise.13 While CTA agrees that cybersecurity already is and should always be among the top priorities for most public companies, cybersecurity expertise by its nature is diverse—it can be both sector specific and dependent on the innovative capabilities of interdisciplinary experts—and likely cannot be adequately quantified in an SEC disclosure. Such a requirement would more likely push companies to check the box with token qualifications among one or more board members, rather than a discerning, holistic suite of risk management experience and expertise—including diverse cybersecurity experience and expertise—that companies apply in their board appointments.   Any Rules Must Contribute to a Coordinated, Dynamic, Adaptive Cybersecurity Approach. To effectively address the cybersecurity challenges facing our nation, the Biden Administration and independent federal agencies are working to coordinate a dynamic, whole of government approach. The National Security Council is leading coordination of this effort given its visibility across relevant agencies, and Congress has specifically directed CISA to lead development of  11 See Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of the 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 117 103, div. Y, H.R. 2471 990, 117th Cong.

Nor should it presume a one size fits all sectors approach.  Any required disclosure should avoid reliance on a calcified compliance checklist that commits companies to practices that become rapidly outdated as the threat landscape evolves. Likewise, care should be taken such that a company is not required by law to disclose information that would unintentionally benefit malicious actors, such as details regarding specific practices or response playbooks.  Should the SEC develop final rules in this proceeding, it should do so with an understanding that different sectors have different needs and each actor in the ecosystem—public or private— must bring its unique expertise and tools to bear to support an operational and collaborative approach to cybersecurity. The SEC should further this process by tailoring its focus to its mission and supporting a proactively harmonized whole of government process—strategically aimed at achieving the governments goals.

Countryman, Secretary US Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: File Number S7 09 22  May 9, 2022  Dear Ms. Countryman: The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) is pleased to comment on the recent rulemaking release describing proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.i As the nations leading organization for director education and certification, with a membership of more than 23,000, NACD extends its support for many of the proposed concepts in this Release. We also encourage the SEC to revise a few concepts. We have made our support for board level oversight of cybersecurity and attendant risks clear in NACDs handbook on Cyber Risk Oversight (February 2020),ii produced in collaboration with the Internet Security Alliance (ISA). Citing the NACD ISA handbook, the Release notes that senior management and boards of directors of public companies have become increasingly concerned about cybersecurity threats. (Release, Note 14), and further that to mitigate the potential costs and damage that can result from a material cybersecurity incident, management and boards of directors may establish and maintain effective risk management strategies to address cybersecurity risks (Proposed Rule, Note 20). Furthermore, the Release appropriately cites NACDs report on The State of Cyber Risk Disclosures of Public Companies (March 2021).iii Turning to the Release itself, we support the consistent disclosure of information in the four main substantive areas covered in the proposed rules according to the Release, namely: material cybersecurity incident and response reporting; cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures; role of management in cybersecurity implementation; and board cybersecurity expertise and oversight. Furthermore, we support use of Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL) for any disclosures as a lever for creating comparability across reporting.  Our work in partnership with our members and with organizations like ISA underscores that the cybersecurity specific roles of the board and management are distinct. Management holds the power to control and mitigate this risk, and to drill deeply into breaches and  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org incidents when they happen. The boards role is to make sure that the corporations cybersecurity program is well managed and that the risk is well controlled. While we support the overarching goals of these proposed disclosure standards and their alignment with the distinct roles of the board and management, we have suggestions for improvement, clarification, or refinement to meet the reality of board level cyber risk oversight. We also urge the commission to review with greater specificity the types of compliance already commonly adopted across organizations before this proposal is completed and enforced. Many registered companies may already be practicing risk management reporting, adhering to cybersecurity compliance frameworks both voluntary and mandated that could translate to easier reporting against the SECs proposed rules. (Examples of frameworks follow after our comments on specific questions in the Release.) Still more companies cybersecurity programs may be too early in their maturity or lacking in funding for the sophistication of reporting requested here. We address these points later in our comment, and hope that the Commission finds these suggestions and comments useful in their final rulemaking. Answers to the Releases Questions  NACD is pleased to address the questions in the Release that matter to our members who sit on the boards of companies registered with the SEC, including especially provisions that pertain to the role and composition of the board of directors. Question 5. The Commission asks for comments on a proposed standard that would require prompt disclosure of a cyber breach after the breach is deemed material, rather than simply after the date of the breach. NACDs Answer. Yes, we support the notion that only material breaches should be disclosed, not any and all breaches. Meanwhile, we agree with the discussion of materiality in the Release, which states, citing court cases, that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision, or if it would have significantly altered the ‘total mix of information made available. This should be up to the companys board and counsel to determine. We would also recommend a reference to materiality standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is continually fine tuning the definition of materiality to meet investor needs. Reference to these standards or another that the Commission identifies as most relevant to this form of disclosure would clarify for reporting companies and investors  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org alike how determinations were made about the materiality of a breach, in whole or in aggregate. Question 17. The Commission asks whether, in addition to the disclosures already in the proposed rule, there are other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures and governance that should be disclosed. NACDs Answer. Yes. One disclosure item that is not in the proposed rule, and which we would recommend, is an affirmative statement that provides assurance to shareholders and other stakeholders that the board plays a role in ensuring adequate company investment in cybersecurity. We also recommend an affirmative statement providing assurance that the board of directors empowers whomever is most senior within the companys cybersecurity program with the resources and reporting lines needed to be a successful business enabler and defender. Finally, we would recommend that the role of internal audit be affirmed as independent when delivering assurance, perhaps periodically in cadence, that cyber risks are well controlled. We would, however, only recommend these points if these assurances could be protected by a safe harbor rule. Question 23. The Commission asks if the rules for disclosing oversight details should exempt, or at least phase in, smaller companies. (The proposed rules lack such an exemption, on the grounds that smaller companies get attacked with relatively high frequency.) NACDs Answer. NACD would support phasing in of the requirement for smaller companies, as long as other safeguards (such as safe harbor and flexibility of definitions) remain in place. In the absence of such safeguards, we would support an absolute exemption for smaller companies. We believe that phasing in should occur because the expertise required will need to be established for some firms to be able to comply with these rules. While there is a national security imperative underlying the Commissions urgency around this rule, other laws have been introduced, voted upon, or passed of late to compel stronger security in smaller businesses—notably the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022, which passed in the Senate in March 2022, and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, which became law in March 2022 when the omnibus spending bill was signed into law. We urge this phased in approach to allow smaller companies to focus on maturing their security operations before being beholden to more fulsome reporting to the board and, eventually, to deeper regulation. We also remind the Commission that these smaller organizations may need to place greater attention and emphasis with compliance and reporting on laws meant to defend the homeland—laws that, in many  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org cases, have tighter time lines for reporting than the SECs proposed time line of four days from the time of determining that a breach was material.  Question 25. The Commission asks about possible redundancy in its proposed additions to Regulation S K,iv namely a new Item 106 (under Business) to mandate more disclosures about cybersecurity risk management and oversight, including use of auditors,v (without mandating a particular framework); and new provisions under Item 407 (under Governance) to mandate disclosure of board expertise in cybersecurity.vi The Commission is asking whether these overlap and if so, what to do. NACDs Answer. This is an important question because Regulation S K, covering narrative disclosures, together with Regulation S X, covering numeric disclosures, forms the very basis of the US disclosure framework. Whatever goes into Regulation S K as a disclosure standard often becomes the operating standard for boards. We appreciate the fact that the SEC is not imposing any particular framework for oversight. We do not believe that these two areas overlap. The question of oversight and the question of expertise are different. A strong framework for oversight can make up for the lack of specialized expertise on the board, because outside expertise can be obtained and consulted by the board; however, the converse is not true. The presence of a cybersecurity expert on a board cannot make up for poor oversight processes, and does not excuse the full board from its oversight duties in this matter. We do believe that disclosure about board level cybersecurity governance should appear in the 10 K, while the disclosure about expertise should appear in the proxy. Furthermore, we believe that these disclosures should appear in the same place in each document. Consistency of placement across documents will facilitate ease of review by interested investors and stakeholders. Question 27. The Commission asks if companies should be required to disclose the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors. NACDs Answer. We support identifying by name any directors with cybersecurity expertise (assuming the proposed safe harborvii clause stays), and indeed would expand the disclosure to include statements on any directors who have received education specific to cyber risk oversight best practices. As written, the proposal may apply only to a narrow margin of directors at registered companies, as only a small portion of directors at publicly traded companies were this type of technologist in their work in management. However, many directors actively seek out ongoing education about cyber risk oversight best practices and developments related to that duty. This education and experience type is not listed explicitly within the definition of expertise within the proposal, and we urge the Commission to expand the  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org definition of expertise to include this education type. The proposed rule makes it clear that responsibility for cyber risk oversight lies with the full board and not any particular individual, and we strongly support this concept.viii Question 28. The Commission asks if a registrant should be required to disclose the lack of a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors. NACDs Answer. We reject this proposed rule. Not every single company will have exposure significant enough to merit the presence of a cybersecurity expert on the board, yet making a disclosure to this effect may act as a false sign of weakness to threat actors that could court trouble for the company. If a company is required to disclose the lack of any role, we propose that they be required to disclose the lack of a designated, management level role responsible for cybersecurity such as the chief information security officer or equivalent. While board level oversight may be achieved sufficiently without an expert on the board, a company must be properly staffed and funded, not to mention led by a strong manager, in order to be able to mitigate cyber risks. Questions 29 through 31. The Commission asks if the mandate to disclose expertise should be accompanied by a required description expertise, or if the current approach of providing a nonexclusive list of examples can work. NACDs Answer. We support the currently proposed approach of giving examples, but not requiring any particular type of expertise. Requiring specific types of expertise may lead eventually to specialization of board roles, a move that may undermine board performance and lead to greater financial risk for companies in the long term. Questions 32 and 33. The Commission asks if disclosure of board expertise should be required in an annual report and proxy or information statement, and if so, where. NACDs Answer. We believe that the most important place for the disclosure of director expertise would be the place in the proxy statement where the board is describing qualifications of directors it is proposing for continued board service. Question 34. The Commission asks if the rules should define expertise in the context of board level cybersecurity qualification.  NACDs Answer. We do not believe that the Commission should define expertise, but the rules should require companies to do so. For this purpose, the rules could contain an example of how expertise might be defined. Whether the Commission defines  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org expertise explicitly or provides examples of how companies might define expertise themselves, we urge the Commission to include points made in our response to Question 27 about inclusion of continuing education about board level cyber risk oversight best practices. Question 35. The Commission asks if certain kinds of companies such as smaller companies should be excluded from the requirement to make disclosures about cybersecurity expertise of any particular director/s. NACDs Answer. While we support exemptions in other areas, we do not believe that it is necessary to exempt smaller companies from the cybersecurity expertise disclosure, provided that all other related aspects of the rules remain intact, as discussed above in Questions 28 (re a safe harbor) and 28 31 (re definitions). Question 36. The Commission asks if commenters support the proposed safe harbor, which clarifies that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under federal securities laws. NACDs Answer. We strongly support this provision in the proposed rules and would recommend in addition a safe harbor for descriptions of oversight. Suggestion for Creating Efficiencies As stated above, we would like to offer some concepts for the Commission to consider ahead of finalizing this rule. • Review commonly used risk management frameworks and align SEC disclosure rules to drive efficiency. Registered companies with mature cybersecurity risk management practices are already complying with a litany of laws and industry relevant compliance frameworks both voluntary and mandated in nature. NACD and ISA in its handbook suggest that companies of all types at minimum measure risk over time against the National Institute of Standards and Technologys Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CF). NIST CF is widely used and translates complex cybersecurity risk concepts into terminology and reports that are well understood by corporate board members. The economic analysis of the Release acknowledges that many companies are beholden by law to use NIST CF, and those companies may be layering other voluntary and mandatory compliance frameworks on top of or alongside it. Some popular examples of other frameworks include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)s Standards 27001 and 27002, and Service Organization Control  1515 N. Courthouse Road, Suite 1200 Arlington, VA 22201  |  Phone |  nacdonline.org Type 2 (SOC 2), which was developed by the AICPA. There are a number of other compliance frameworks that stakeholders in registered companies are demanding be in place in order to do business with those companies, and many already account for cybersecurity corporate governance—especially SOC 2.ix Given current rigor around compliance with best practices and these frameworks, we urge the Commission and its staff to provide guidance on how companies can map current compliance disclosures in these frameworks back to the SECs desired uniformity of disclosure. This would create efficiencies for companies already doing due diligence and provide a road map for boards looking to advise and nurture strong oversight practices and reporting. • Balance the need for consistently reported information with the demands of securing a company and empowering innovation. We also believe that aligning SEC disclosure with compliance measures already in place would empower companies to build security into their products and innovation efforts. Enabling cybersecurity practitioners to focus on those two business areas would create value for shareholders, instead of demanding further time and investment into compliance work that might already be happening in one or more other places. Managers of mature security teams are already spending an outsized amount of time meeting compliance requirements, a task that pulls their attention away from the time sensitive and complex nature of detecting and responding to security incidents— not to mention building a culture of security and innovation within their companies. It might also distract security leaders from reporting clearly to the board on the risks that the company faces and lead to the security organization being underfunded. According to a 2021 survey of global chief information security officers (CISOs) conducted by EY,x one in two surveyed CISOs note that ensuring compliance can be the most stressful part of their jobs. One CISO interviewed—of a major social media platform—noted that he spends between 50 to 60 percent of his time on regulatory matters. Meanwhile, where compliance once was a tool for CISOs to make the case to their boards that the security organization required more fulsome funding, this 2021 survey found that only 18 percent of respondents saw compliance as a way to acquire sufficient budget—down from 29 percent in the 2020 survey by the same firm. To draw a line under this point, it would be prudent to streamline the regulatory demands of this Release with the processes already in place in other state, local, and federal agencies in order to empower the CISO to create a culture of security that supports innovation.  1515 N.

Gleason, President and CEO  William McCracken, Chair National Association of Corporate Directors  Arlington, VA APPENDIX: Five Principles for Cyber Risk Oversight (From Cyber Risk Oversight 2020, Key Principles and Practical Guidance for Corporate Boards, NACD: 2020)  Principle 1: Cybersecurity as a Strategic Risk. Directors need to understand and approach cybersecurity as a strategic, enterprise risk—not just as an IT risk.  Principle 2: Legal and Disclosure Implications. Directors should understand the legal implications of cyber risks as they relate to their companys specific circumstances. Principle 3. Board Oversight Structure and Access to Expertise. Boards should have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise, and discussions about cyber risk management should be given regular and adequate time on board meeting agendas. Principle 4. Enterprise Framework for Managing Cyber Risk. Directors should set the expectation that management will establish an enterprise wide, cyber risk management framework with adequate staffing and budget.  Principle 5. Cybersecurity Measurement and Reporting. Board management discussions about cyber risk should include identification and quantification of financial exposure to cyber risks and which risks to accept, mitigate, or transfer, such as through insurance, as well as specific plans associated with each approach.   1515 N.

To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (Board leadership structure and role in oversight) with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross references in Item 106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? v We are also proposing to add new Item 106 of Regulation S K that would require a registrant to: (1) provide updated disclosure in periodic reports about previously reported cybersecurity incidents; (2) describe its policies and procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats, including whether the registrant considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation; and (3) require disclosure about the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk, managements role in assessing and managing such risk, managements cybersecurity expertise, and managements role in implementing the registrants cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies. vi We also are proposing to amend Item 407 of Regulation SK to require disclosure of whether any member of the registrants board has expertise in cybersecurity, and if so, the nature of such expertise. vii Proposed Item 407(j)(2) would state that a person who is determined to have expertise in cybersecurity will not be deemed an expert for any purpose, including, without limitation, for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), as a result of being designated or identified as a director with expertise in cybersecurity pursuant to proposed Item 407(j). This proposed safe harbor is intended to clarify that Item 407(j) would not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liability imposed on such person as a member of the board of directors in the absence of such designation or identification. This provision should alleviate such concerns for cybersecurity experts considering board service. Conversely, we do not intend for the identification of a cybersecurity expert on the board to decrease the duties and obligations or liability of other board members. viii Conversely, we do not intend for the identification of a cybersecurity expert on the board to decrease the duties and obligations or liability of other board members. ix For more information on the SOC 2 report, visit this webpage: https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report.  x See Cybersecurity: How do you rise above the waves of a perfect storm?, posted on ey.com on July 22, 2021, and available at this URL: https://www.ey.com/en_us/cybersecurity/cybersecurity how do you rise above the waves of a perfect storm#Chapter2",3

The proposed rule concerns Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure with respect to public companies subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Proposal).2 The Commission further requested comments on best practices with respect to such cybersecurity disclosures. SIFMA acknowledges the unquestioned importance of cybersecurity to our country and economy, and to all public companies3 and their investors.4 Accordingly, we applaud the Commission for its continuing attention to corporate cybersecurity risk management. However,  1 SIFMA is the leading trade association for broker dealers, investment banks and asset managers operating in the U.S. and global capital markets. On behalf of our industrys one million employees, we advocate on legislation, regulation and business policy affecting retail and institutional investors, equity and fixed income markets and related products and services. We serve as an industry coordinating body to promote fair and orderly markets, informed regulatory compliance, and efficient market operations and resiliency. We also provide a forum for industry policy and professional development. SIFMA, with offices in New York and Washington, D.C., is the U.S. regional member of the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA). For more information, visit http://www.sifma.org. 2 See Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; RIN 3235 AM89 (proposed Mar. 9, 2022) (the Proposal). 3 Please note that references here to public companies or registrants concern companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 4 See Cybersecurity Resources, SIFMA, available at https://www.sifma.org/resources/cybersecurity resources/; SIFMA Statement on Completion of Quantum Dawn VI Cybersecurity Exercise, SIFMA (Nov. 18, 2021), available at https://www.sifma.org/resources/news/sifma statement on completion of quantum dawn vi cybersecurity exercise/; see also Kevin Eiden et al., Organizational cyber maturity: A survey of industries, MCKINSEY & COMPANY (Aug. 4, 2021), available at https://www mckinsey.com/business functions/risk and resilience/our insights/organizational cyber maturity a survey of industries (finding that banking and healthcare the sectors with the best overall cybersecurity management profiles and that more profitable companies build stronger cybersecurity capabilities). 2  the Commission should distinguish between its role as prudential5 regulator for regulated entities versus its role to assure that public filings under the Exchange Act meaningfully inform investors regarding their investment decisions. As the Proposal stands now, we respectfully submit that the SEC is calling for public disclosure of considerably too much, too sensitive, highly subjective information, at premature points in time, without requisite deference to the prudential regulators of public companies or relevant cybersecurity specialist agencies (like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)). Essentially, such disclosures would benefit cyber attackers more than they would investors. Moreover, the Proposal could be improved by taking into account public companies need to conduct essential internal cybersecurity investigations, coordinate with law enforcement, intelligence and national security agencies, and comply with court orders that may restrict the timing of permissible cybersecurity disclosures. CISA Director Jen Easterlys recently said that CISA is not in the business of stabbing the wounded. 6 The SECs present Proposal, in contrast, would do just that by denying a registrant proper time and focus to remediate and mitigate the impacts of an incident. Further, the Proposal blocks the companys ability to collaborate responsibly with other U.S. agencies (and their foreign counterparts). It also exposes investors to premature, excessive, risky and potentially misleading disclosures. The Proposal strikes the wrong balance by forcing companies to report to the SEC and shareholders prematurely  i.e., before they have an opportunity to collaborate fully with relevant government agencies, and implement effective remediation, mitigation and disruption of the relevant cyber risk. In other words, the Proposals conclusion that, [o]n balance, it is our current view that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors would justify not providing for a reporting delay [for law enforcement investigations]7 is seriously misguided. The U.S. Government has repeatedly invoked the essential importance of public private collaboration to defend against serious cyber attacks,8 but the SECs Proposal ignores what makes such partnerships work. We respectfully submit that relevant U.S. (and international) cybersecurity agencies would question the SECs balance.  Furthermore, SIFMA recognizes that this Proposal is one of many rules which the Commission has produced in the past few months—indeed, the Commission is producing rules at the fastest rate since 2011 (which was largely driven by the Dodd Frank Act).9 Given the range of Commission activity, SIFMA encourages the Commission to cautiously and carefully deliberate over the Proposal so as not to cause significant market disruptions.10  5 Please note that references here to prudential regulators are meant to connote agencies with statutory regulatory responsibility over safety and soundness or behavioral conduct of companies. 6 See Ben Kochman, Biden Cyber Officials Pitch Partnership Amid Hacking Threat, Law360 (Apr. 22, 2022), available at https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1482974/biden cyber officials pitch partnership amid hacking threat. 7 The Proposal at 25. 8 See e.g., Critical Infrastructure Partnerships and Information Sharing, CISA, available at https://www.cisa.gov/critical infrastructure partnerships and information sharing.  9 See Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., Too much, too quickly from the SEC, THE HILL (Apr. 15, 2022), available at https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3267550 too much too quickly from the sec/.  10 Given the complexity of the Proposal and the significance of any rules ultimately adopted by the Commission, SIFMA believes that this short comment period is not adequate to fully analyze and respond to the Proposal. See Joint Comment Letter from SIFMA and other associations to the Commission on the Importance of Appropriate  3 Given the undeniable importance of cybersecurity issues, SIFMA recommends that the SEC should better harmonize and integrate its proposed requirements with extensive existing or in process strategic cybersecurity laws, rules, regulations and authoritative recommendations, including the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (Bi partisan US National Strategy),11  Presidential Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity,12 the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (designating CISA as the central place for US government cybersecurity incident reporting and handling),13 and various prudential regulatory requirements and data breach notification laws throughout each of the 50 United States and various territories. The SEC should also be mindful that many registrants are obligated to work with international cybersecurity counterparts to CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and are subject to complying with global non public, incident reporting regulations. The Proposals balance simply does not take account of this elaborate web of cybersecurity interaction that takes place  behind the scenes  during a significant cyber event or incident.  If the SEC determines to move forward with this Proposal, SIFMA recommends that this guidance should incline toward clearer examples that take into account the various factors the SEC expects companies to weigh in assessing materiality, and should accord greater respect to the myriad other cybersecurity obligations to which public companies are subject. In these circumstances, SIFMA respectfully requests that the Commission issue a revised notice of proposed rulemaking that is properly aligned with these principles before proceeding to a final rule. I. Executive Summary SIFMA believes the Commission should reconsider its proposal in light of the following: • The Commission is not a prudential cybersecurity regulator for all registrants. The Commission should receive input on the Proposal from prudential cybersecurity regulators. The Commission should more thoroughly consider how it will effectively harmonize and collaborate with prudential regulators, as well as the CISA, the FBI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and relevant foreign counterparts, to best support the relevant interests of investors, registrants, critical infrastructure, law enforcement and national security. • The Commission should evaluate and respect the deleterious impact its Proposal could have on the public private partnerships necessary to defend the nations cybersecurity. The Administration and U.S. cybersecurity agencies have repeatedly, publicly invoked that such collaboration is an absolutely essential component of our national cybersecurity strategy. For example, if a company is actively working with CISA, the FBI, and the  Length of Comment Periods, SIFMA (Apr. 5, 2022), available at https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/importance of appropriate length of comment periods.  11 Cybersecurity Solarium Commission, available at https://www.solarium.gov/ (last visited May 9, 2022).  12 Executive Office of the President, Improving Nations Cybersecurity, 86 FR 26633 (May 17, 2021). 13 Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong. (2022). 4  Treasury Department on a live cybersecurity threat, should public reporting to the SEC take precedence over collaboration with these agencies, or alternatively, should such collaboration justify [] providing for a reporting delay? SIFMA respectfully suggests that such cybersecurity agencies might appreciate a reporting delay to combat serious cyber risks effectively and responsibly. • The four business day reporting requirement for material cybersecurity incidents, without needed exceptions, may substantially harm both investors and registrants. While we understand the four business day reporting requirement is the standard for all 8 K updates, other 8 K filings are typically less complex than an ongoing cybersecurity incident and do not put registrants at risk like a cyber filing would. Specifically, such reporting requirements may impede necessary and essential internal investigations or cooperation with U.S. law enforcement or national security agencies (and their foreign counterparts). Additionally, this rigid timeline may cause registrants to publicly disclose information before they have a complete understanding of the incident, and such public disclosure may result in investor confusion and unwarranted stock impacts. For example, premature or disproportionate reporting of incidents could imply a materiality that is promptly abated by successful incident response, effective mitigation or remediation, or sufficient business resiliency protocols and resources, or later determined to have not been material in the first instance. Moreover, the four business day deadline to disclose after determining materiality will tend to incentivize registrants to err on the side of over reporting  i.e., lowering the proper threshold for materiality determinations. If this timeframe were retained, then exceptions are needed, for example, for ongoing investigations and cooperation with law enforcement or cybersecurity agencies. The Proposal may initiate premature public disclosure of cyber incidents and incident details which will have a significant likelihood of interfering with and damaging US national security, especially if release of this information is related to a nation state attack and is not coordinated with the appropriate prudential cybersecurity agencies and regulators. • Premature, disproportionate and overly prescriptive public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, and cybersecurity risk management practices and governance risks, will inevitably harm registrants without providing benefits to investors. Disclosure could tip off malicious actors to thematic vulnerabilities within the affected company or within companies throughout the financial sector, especially if an incident has not been fully remediated. This risk is compounded if the SEC further requires detailed disclosures about relevant supply chains. • The proposed guidance and examples related to the materiality standard are unduly subjective and overly vague. The Proposal seems to presume (without substantiation) that there is currently systematic under reporting of material cybersecurity incidents to investors. Specifically, the examples of material cybersecurity incidents in the Proposal imply an overly broad approach to materiality. The Proposal could result in registrants over reporting on cybersecurity incidents, thereby eroding the concept of materiality.  • The Commissions reporting requirement also conflicts with both Federal and State data breach notification laws and could merely add another confusing compliance burden to registrants that provides minimal benefit to investors. At the very least, the SEC should 5  reconcile its reporting requirements with applicable data breach notification laws so that public disclosure to investors does not occur before companies complete appropriate investigations and analysis to comply with such laws. • The Proposals board and governance disclosure requirements could cause management to look to SEC reporting standards for applicable cybersecurity standards instead of focusing on what prudential regulators and cybersecurity agencies require or recommend.  • Appointing a cybersecurity expert to a registrants board of directors is not necessarily the best or only way to advance the oversight of a board as a deliberative body. Additionally, this may be difficult for differently sized registrants, especially considering the lack of availability of recognized experts and the difficulties and costs of finding such experts. This could be misleading to investors because a company without specific board experts in cybersecurity may have an extremely knowledgeable CISO and information security staff. In addition, the SEC should avoid directing public companies to seek out single focus directors. • The costs of compliance with the Proposal will include diversion of resources and diffusion of focus away from compliance with and implementation of cybersecurity practices that are actually required of or appropriate for public companies in different sectors and with different cybersecurity risk profiles. Moreover, the Commission should revise its economic analysis of the Proposal based on the comments it receives so as to more accurately describe the benefits to investors, costs to registrants, and heightened cyber risks to companies, the economy and national security.  II. The Proposal Would Establish the SEC as a Cybersecurity Regulator for Public Registrants and Exceed the SECs Authority; the SEC Role Should Be Confined to What Is Strictly Relevant to Investment Decisions. a. The Appropriate Cybersecurity Regulators We applaud the SEC for recognizing that cybersecurity risks, mitigation strategies, and frameworks are critical to management and investors of nearly all public registrants. However, the SEC should proceed with caution and refer to existing rules, guidance, regulators, cybersecurity agencies and consumer protection authorities. While the Commission is a prudential regulator for broker dealers and registered investment advisers, it is not so for registrants with respect to cybersecurity, or otherwise. As recently discussed by Chair Gensler, the SEC has a role to play with respect to cybersecurity, but [o]ther government entities, such as the [FBI] and CISA, captain Team Cyber.14 The Commission should collaborate with and defer to other agencies to avoid disrupting the collaborative cyber effort.  14 Chair Gary Gensler, Working On ‘Team Cyber  Remarks Before the Joint Meeting of the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC), SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Apr. 14, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler speech joint meeting 041422.  6  For example, public registrants in the financial sector are already and soon will be subject to yet further cybersecurity requirements from a formidable array of regulators, regulations and strongly recommended guidance. Below is just a partial sample of representative cybersecurity regulations applicable to registrants that are financial institutions. The SEC does not need to add to this myriad of regulations simply to enlarge its role in this space for public companies generally. For instance, SIFMA members already respond to or are regulated by the following U.S. agencies (or their foreign counterparts) on matters related to cybersecurity, including: CISA; Commodity Futures Trading Commission; FBI; the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and Federal Bank Regulators such as the Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Futures Association, New York Department of Financial Services (specifically through its Cybersecurity Regulation),  and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Additionally, insurance company members are also regulated by insurance regulators in each state and territory where they are licensed to do business. And, of course, the SEC is also a prudential regulator for certain financial institutions in their capacities as broker dealers or as other SEC registered entities (and the Commission has only recently proposed new rulemaking in that capacity). Moreover, numerous SIFMA members may be considered critical infrastructure subject to specific regulations—SIFMA recommends the Commission harmonize its rules to ensure they do not conflict with security incident reporting requirements for critical infrastructure. b. The Commission Should Collaborate and Coordinate with Prudential Cybersecurity Regulators to Ensure the Proposal Does Not Conflict With Any Existing or Upcoming Regulations  The last few years has seen a preponderance of legislation and regulatory requirements, many of which are upcoming. President Biden signed an Executive Order on May 12, 2021, on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity, which primarily focused on improving federal agencies cybersecurity defenses, as well as improving the cybersecurity of the supply chain. Congress recently passed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, which will require critical infrastructure entities to report material cybersecurity incidents and ransomware payments to CISA within 72 and 24 hours, respectively.15 CISA must promulgate a proposed implementing regulation within 24 months from final enactment date of March 15, 2022, and a final regulation no later than 18 months thereafter. The Act also calls for harmonization of cybersecurity reporting that would help avoid counter productive and burdensome conflicts and redundancy. SIFMA recommends that the Commission focus on eliciting high level rather than granular information from registrants concerning the cyber regulation and standards to which they are subject and how they address such obligations, as well as what genuinely material cyber risks they have faced and are likely to face.  15 As drafted, the reporting requirements will cover multiple sectors of the economy, including chemical industry entities, commercial facilities, communications sector entities, critical manufacturing, dams, financial services entities, food and agriculture sector entities, healthcare entities, information technology, energy, and transportation.  7  Material should represent a reasonably high threshold, not a commonplace one. By proliferating additional cybersecurity standards and reporting requirements, registrants and investors will be confused, and registrants that are the victims of cybercrime or other cyber attacks will inevitably have to address another layer of investigation by a division of an agency whose expertise and responsibility are not, and should not be, focused on cybersecurity. SIFMA encourages the Commission to collaborate with other agencies working in this area so as not to risk requiring duplicative or misplaced efforts from registrants. SIFMA also recommends that the Commission consider providing certain safe harbors from additional reporting requirements, or forbearance, for industries that are already heavily regulated with respect to their substantive cybersecurity and data protection practices and disclosure requirements. At a minimum, the Commission should explain and justify how it harmonizes its Proposal with, and defers to, the work of agencies that are authorized to regulate or provide guidance on cybersecurity. The Commission should acknowledge that cybersecurity regulation of registrants is outside the primary competency and authorization of the Division of Corporation Finance and that detailed cybersecurity regulation of registrants will cause undue proliferation of cyber standards and will be confusing, burdensome and ultimately counter productive. Additionally, the Commission should recognize that FINRA and Division of Exams have existing responsibilities related to cybersecurity and information security and do so through periodic examinations outside of the public company context.  c. The Appropriateness of Disclosures. i. Granular Public Disclosures May Lead to Investor Confusion, Market Volatility, and Security Risks Disclosures in public filings should not be an avenue for substantive cybersecurity regulation. This Proposal risks misalignment of responsibility. The Proposal may not protect the orderliness of the markets and public confidence in the market system. For instance, public companies should not learn about third party security incidents from the service providers SEC filings (as opposed to directly from their own service providers). By displacing existing data breach and cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, the Proposal may disrupt proper business to business reporting relationships.  Additionally, the proposed use of the SECs prescribed disclosure forms is procrustean, and may lead to further confusion. Standardized forms can lead to confusion by including character limits for certain questions or only providing drop down menus with limited options.  Forcing cybersecurity disclosures into pre assigned forms could result in one size distorting all. Flexibility is inherently necessary and appropriate for the broad diversity of businesses, capabilities, strategies, threats and risks faced by different companies. Registrants should have the flexibility to describe their cybersecurity disclosures in the manner that fits their profiles, rather than standardizing disclosure. Moreover, requiring excessive or specified granular detail could make for misleading or unhelpful boilerplate. Public disclosure of granular information could also lead to heightened security risks. Disclosure could tip off other malicious actors to thematic vulnerabilities within the affected 8  company or within companies throughout the financial sector, especially if the incident has not been fully remediated. ii. The Commission Should Consider a More Flexible Method for Public Disclosures SIFMA recommends the Commission consider a less rigid response. At a minimum, SIFMA recommends that the Commission tighten certain definitions and drop vague references, which will promote clarity for compliance obligations. For instance, the definition of Cybersecurity Incident is too broad, and the list of examples in the Proposal may illustrate a threshold that is too low. The current definition of Cybersecurity Incident as an occurrence that jeopardizes a registrants information systems or information, as opposed to an occurrence that has an actual impact on such systems or information, is simply too expansive, and could capture potential events that do not and likely will not actually result in significant, negative (material) impact to the registrant. SIFMA recommends the Commission provide further clarity to narrow this definition. The number of different, separate disclosures required by the Proposal is also unreasonable. It cannot be justified under the Paperwork Reduction Act  especially in light of myriad other existing cybersecurity disclosure and reporting obligations.16 We recommend the Commission reexamine and re issue its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in light of the comments provided here. Specifically, the amount of information the Proposal would require to be produced is unwarranted in light of other, existing regulations and the Commissions lack of statutory responsibility for cybersecurity regulation of public companies. iii. Public Disclosures May Give Rise to Unwarranted Liability and Risk Additionally, required disclosures may expose registrants to excessive, unwarranted securities litigation or potential enforcement every time they are attacked by cybercriminals or state sponsored threat actors regardless of whether there is any actual material impact or fault on the part of the registrant, and constrain companies ability to defend themselves properly against legal challenges. Unrefined and indiscriminate piling on of legal risks in the realm of cybersecurity is in the interest of neither registrants nor their investors. In general, enforcement against companies that are the victims of cyber attacks should be the province of prudential regulators or consumer protection authorities, not via collateral litigation or securities law enforcement. Prudential regulators or consumer protection authorities are in the best position to evaluate the sufficiency of a companys cybersecurity safeguards and  16 While the Proposal purports to conduct a Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, its calculation of costs and benefits is skewed. Different but overlapping disclosure and reporting requirements do not correlate with lower burdens on information providers, but rather, escalated burdens and costs. And if the overlapping requirements conflict or confuse, the resulting benefits to information recipients can be non existent or negative. Also, while not directly addressed in the Proposal, SIFMA respectfully notes that cybersecurity enforcement type or educational sweeps conducted by the SEC to elicit information about cybersecurity risks and practices must also comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, and receive requisite advance approval from the Office of Management and Budgets Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 9  efforts relative to the risks they face. Additionally, prudential regulators and law enforcement are the best positioned to assist registrants in pursuing bad actors. d. Existing SEC Guidance Is Already Reasonably Effective and Could Be Sufficient with Some Updating and Limited Additional Elaboration. A rule as granular and prescriptive as the Proposal is not necessary and SIFMA encourages the SEC to instead build off its current guidance in this area. For example, in 2020, the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), renamed now the Division of Examinations, published exam observations that discuss several industry practices, including governance and risk management; access rights and controls; data loss prevention; mobile security; incident response and resiliency; vendor management; and training and awareness.17  Additionally, in 2018, the SEC published a Release titled Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, which emphasized a range of factors that may affect whether an incident should be disclosed to investors beyond the bottom line financial costs to respond to the incident.18 Also in 2018, the SEC released an investigative report on business email compromises, which cautioned public companies to consider cyber threats when implementing internal accounting controls.19  SEC enforcement also provides a relevant guide for registrants. For instance, the SEC charged the entity formerly known as Yahoo! Inc. for misleading investors by failing to disclose one of the worlds largest data breaches in which hackers stole personal data relating to hundreds of millions of user accounts.20 The Yahoo! settlement in particular has provided some guidance to registrants about what sort of public company breaches were subject to SEC jurisdiction. As stated in the SECs press release, Yahoos failure to have controls and procedures in place to assess its cyber disclosure obligations ended up leaving its investors totally in the dark about a massive data breach. Public companies should have controls and procedures in place to properly evaluate cyber incidents and disclose material information to investors.21  Finally, the SEC frequently publishes alerts on cybersecurity, such as the Division of Examinations which published three related alerts in 2020 (OCIE Cybersecurity and Resiliency Practices; Ransomware Alert; and Safeguarding Client Accounts against Credential Compromise). Rather than implement a detailed, overweening new Proposal, the SEC can build off these existing guides and best practices. 17 See Cybersecurity and Resiliency Observations, OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS AND EXAMINATIONS (Jan. 27, 2020), https://www.sec.gov/report/ocie cybersecurity resiliency observations.  18 See Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf.  19 See SEC Investigative Report: Public Companies Should Consider Cyber Threats When Implementing Internal Accounting Controls, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Oct. 16, 2018), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/press release/2018 236.  20 Altaba, Formerly Known as Yahoo!, Charged With Failing to Disclose Massive Cybersecurity Breach; Agrees To Pay $35 Million, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Apr. 24, 2018), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/press release/2018 71.  21 Id. 10  III. Incident Reporting Requirements The Commissions four business day reporting period for material cybersecurity incidents could actually pose risk to registrants and their investors. We recommend that the Commission reconsider the four business day reporting period to align with the specific circumstances, exigencies, regulatory obligations, and investigative needs applicable to any given incident. A specific timeframe for public disclosure is simply misguided. If incidents are truly material, perhaps an argument can be made that investors should know about breaches before impacted data subjects, but in general, experience suggests that is unnecessary and may be inappropriate. Additionally, we recommend the Commission revise the incident reporting form to only include a general description of an incidents high level details to the extent needed to convey the material parts of the incident, such as the basic nature, scope and impact of the incident and avoid mandating or suggesting an SEC format for incident reporting (e.g., Item 1.05). Numerous federal, state and international data breach notification and cybersecurity event reporting statutes already exist  and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is not one of them. a. Item 1.05 Should Not Require Public Disclosure of Remediation Details. Request for Comment 1. A rigid four business day reporting requirement may go against the principles of responsible disclosure. Responsible disclosure entails holding off on public disclosure until the responsible parties have been allowed sufficient time to patch or remediate the vulnerability or issue. This is particularly important for financial institutions and other critical institutions.  Victims of significant cyber breaches must be able to focus on mitigating the incident without the additional pressure of prematurely stimulating market volatility or exposing themselves to additional risk prior to full remediation of the vulnerability. Under the Commissions current Proposal, registrants would be required to publicly disclose certain incidents that are still in the process of being remediated or that may also impact other registrants that have not yet been notified or had time to investigate or remediate. We recommend the Commission remove (5) from Item 1.05—registrants should not be forced to disclose details of remediations, and registrants should only publicly disclose such information after the incident has been fully investigated and remediated. We also note that requiring disclosure prior to full remediation may signal to the current threat actor or other bad actors that the registrant continues to have a vulnerability that can be further exploited and may otherwise jeopardize internal remediation efforts. Disclosure prior to remediation may also make the registrant more susceptible to other attacks: while the registrants resources are focused on remediating the disclosed issue, the malefactor or other bad actors may look to attack the registrants environment more broadly in the hope of identifying other vulnerabilities to exploit. Requiring public disclosure prior to fully implementing remediation risks unintended adverse impacts to shareholders and the markets. Such premature notification may cause shareholders to withdraw their investment from the company, even in situations where the company believes that effective remediation would mitigate the overall risk of the cyber incident 11  without material adverse impact on the business. Requiring premature disclosure could therefore add to undesirable market volatility and prompt unwarranted securities litigation.  b. The Proposals Incident Reporting Requirements on Form 8 K Are Unnecessarily Prescriptive and May Impede Internal Investigations of Cyber Incidents and Events that Registrants Routinely Must Conduct. Request for Comment 3, 4, 7 i. Four Business Days May Be Insufficient Time to Fully Investigate and Publicly Disclose a Cybersecurity Incident The Proposal acknowledges but does not adequately respect the need of registrants to dedicate essential, necessary time to investigate in order to understand and mitigate or remediate incidents, and to work collaboratively with law enforcement, prudential regulators, cybersecurity agencies, national security agencies, and other necessary entities. During an incident investigation, a registrants understanding of the incident naturally evolves. Disclosing an incident quickly could cause inadequate or unreliable reports to be filed, which should not yet be relied upon, and which could lead to media and other questions that distract from core incident response and remediation efforts, as well as investor confusion. Further, the detailed requirements for disclosure will make updates and corrections more likely, creating potential investor confusion, which could undercut the SECs mission of ensuring orderly markets. The Proposal provides some helpful guidelines and flexibility for reporting material cybersecurity incidents. However, requiring registrants to report material cybersecurity incidents four business days after determining the incident is material may add an unnecessary burden on these registrants as they deal with an ongoing incident. The first few days of a cybersecurity incident are crucial. In a real world scenario, such as the NotPetya cyber attacks in June 2017, impacted companies may only know that systems have gone offline, and may be struggling to stay afloat, within the first four business days after an incident. Reporting the incident publicly before an investigation is fully underway and before relevant facts can be gathered and impacts assessed could be devastating for a company under those circumstances, and in the case of financial institutions, could even lead to scenarios such as bank runs. The proposed real time and after the fact reporting of cybersecurity incidents will have unintended consequences such as a distraction of time and resources from the registrants actual response, as well as a signal to the threat actors about the registrants level of knowledge related to the incident. Requiring registrants to fill out a standardized form in four business days—when they are perhaps undergoing real time incident response and do not have all facts in place— would not only place an undue administrative burden on these registrants, but would also open registrants up to civil and criminal liability for misrepresentations made when a company knows that it is not in possession of all relevant facts. Additionally, as discussed by Commissioner Peirces Dissenting Statement, the Proposal does not consider the need to cooperate with, and sometimes defer to, the federal government and state government.  Ongoing governmental investigations (or remediation or disruption efforts) may need to stay confidential for a certain period of time and doing so could increase the chances of recovery of stolen funds or prevention of additional wrongdoing. 12 ii. The Commission Should Consider Exceptions to the Four Business Day Reporting Requirement for Material Cybersecurity Incidents The SEC acknowledges the importance of cooperation with law enforcement by companies impacted by cybersecurity incidents but has not allowed for delayed reporting because of a companys cooperation with law enforcement. This exception is a must have, and not having it means a company that has already been impacted by a cyber attack will be forced to choose between jeopardizing criminal or national security investigations that may have dire national implications or suffering the consequences of not complying with the SECs rules. Publicly disclosing information that law enforcement or regulators could utilize in an investigation could impede the proper course of the investigation and cause unintended consequences, such as revealing sensitive information upon which bad actors might act. And this is at a time where law enforcement is striving to improve disclosure and collaboration with impacted companies in order to better protect U.S. companies and individuals and to catch cyber criminals and other malicious actors. Other regulators with strict reporting deadlines do not publicly disclose information related to ongoing investigations. Indeed, other agencies that request information on security incidents, such as CISA and the FBI, have stressed that they do not share breach report data with regulatory agencies such as the FTC or SEC.22 Significantly, companies may receive court orders that prohibit any disclosure, including of course public disclosure, of cybersecurity incidents in order to allow government agencies time to obtain evidence and even to plan and execute technical operations to disrupt malicious cyberattacks.23 Form 8 K and Item 1.05 should include an exception to the reporting time where disclosure of a cyber incident or vulnerability could have a more damaging effect than delayed disclosure. For example, if a company discovers it has been impacted by a zero day vulnerability in widely used software, and the company is required by the SEC to report it publicly, before allowing sufficient time for a patch or other remedial measures to be put in place, other companies will be caught on a backfoot, while bad actors are able to exploit the vulnerability across multiple companies.24 Such a responsible disclosure exception would allow vendors a reasonable opportunity to develop a patch so that other companies could harden their cyber defenses and eliminate the possibility that a report under this regime could alert hackers to an unpatched weakness and lead to a more widespread harm than otherwise would have been experienced.  22 See Ben Kochman, Biden Cyber Officials Pitch Partnership Amid Hacking Threat, Law360 (Apr. 22, 2022), available at https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1482974/biden cyber officials pitch partnership amid hacking threat.  23 See Justice Department Announces Court Authorized Disruption of Botnet Controlled by the Russian Federations Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (Apr. 6, 2022), available at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice department announces court authorized disruption botnet controlled russian federation. 24 See CISA COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE (CVD) PROCESS, CYBERSECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY, available at https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated vulnerability disclosure process (last visited May 9, 2022). 13  c. Public Disclosures of Cybersecurity Incidents May Have Severe or Significant Detrimental Security Implications. Request for Comment 1, 2, and 3 The Proposal would require registrants to reveal sensitive information concerning material security incidents—many of which may be ongoing incidents. Malicious threat actors will undoubtedly use this information, and could stand to benefit from it in many ways:  (1) If a threat actor is engaged in attacking a registrant, and it notices that the registrant has not notified the SEC, the threat actor may infer that it has not been detected and will use that information accordingly.  (2) If a threat actor is engaged in attacking a registrant, and it notices that the registrant has notified the SEC, it will monitor the release to learn how much the registrant knows of the incident. The threat actor may choose to immediately exfiltrate data if it knows it has been identified and its presence in a system may soon be remediated. Conversely, the threat actor may leverage separate attacks if it learns that the registrant does not completely understand the scope of the attack or has not mitigated the attack. (3) If a registrant publicly discloses an ongoing attack by a threat actor, other threat actors may monitor the publicly available information and target the registrant as well. (4) If a registrant publicly discloses that a material incident has not been remediated (or is in the process of being remediated), threat actors will exploit this vulnerability. Disclosing individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents which have become material in the aggregate will also have potentially negative consequences. Many of these disclosures may provide a road map to threat actors for how to continue to exploit a vulnerability, and it is best to wait to properly disclose until after the vulnerability has been remediated.  Under the current Proposal, registrants would have to disclose the details of material cybersecurity incidents within four business days, even if the registrants are unable to mitigate the vulnerability themselves or have limited information. Upstream vendors could be the source of a material security incident, and the registrant may be unable to fix the issue until the vendor has remediated it. Registrants may be largely dependent on vendors to provide information in these circumstances. The Commission should consider removing (1) and (3) from Item 1.05. For purposes of informing shareholders, the disclosure should only include a brief description of the incident and the effects (if any) on the registrants operations. More detailed information, especially for an ongoing incident, will complicate incident response, increase potential liability (with respect to attackers and from a legal standpoint), and lead to more public relations efforts on the part of the registrant that suffered the incident without clearly providing additional benefits to investors. The types of information the SEC states it would not expect a company to disclose should include information related to a companys cyber insurance policies, because malicious actors, particularly ransomware attackers, look for this type of information to craft ransom demands. 14  d. The Proposed Materiality Standard Is Unduly Subjective and Vague and Could Result in Registrants Being Held Unfairly Accountable to a Standard that Only Appears to Be Objective or Precise. Request for Comment 5, 8, and 12. i. The Proposal Lacks Clarity on What Constitutes a Material Cybersecurity Incident  and Does Not Take Adequate Account of Available Resiliency and Recovery Mitigations  Only material cybersecurity events should be publicly reported, but there is currently a lack of clear explanation on how to make this determination as it relates to cybersecurity incidents. Although the Commission does discuss the definition of materiality, the Proposal is unduly subjective and vague as to what types of incidents could rise to the level of materiality and under what circumstances. It is rare that a cybersecurity incident is immediately obvious as material  especially where cybersecurity programs now stress resiliency and recovery in addition to prevention. The Proposal provides various qualitative dimensions to consider in determining the materiality of a cybersecurity incident, but the Proposal lacks concrete thresholds to assist registrants in determining materiality. Lack of clarity could lead to investor confusion over how to discern between the impactful security incidents from the non impactful security incidents. Some internal cyber events, including even data loss, impacting IT systems may be potentially consequential to companies, but would not necessarily be material provided that companies effectively mitigate through remediation, back ups and resiliency.  Companies should be permitted to make their own determination of incidents that rise to the level of notification—and these considerations should include ensuring that any publicly disclosed information does not put the registrant at further risk. If not, the Commission should consider a quantifiable threshold for materiality that would be similar to other financial losses for materiality determinations.  The Proposal provides a non exclusive list of examples of cybersecurity incidents which, if deemed material may trigger incident disclosure. For reference, the list includes the following examples: ▪ An unauthorized incident that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset (data, system, or network); or violated the registrants security policies or procedures. Incidents may stem from the accidental exposure of data or from a deliberate attack to steal or alter data; ▪ An unauthorized incident that caused degradation, interruption, loss of control, damage to, or loss of operational technology systems; ▪ An incident in which an unauthorized party accessed, or a party exceeded authorized access, and altered, or has stolen sensitive business information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, or information that has resulted, or may result, in a loss or liability for the registrant; ▪ An incident in which a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to publicly disclose sensitive company data; or ▪ An incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered. 15 This list comprises types of incidents that if well managed through effective incident response and remediation, would not necessarily constitute a material cybersecurity incident.  Indeed, many SIFMA members have protocols in place which would mitigate the negative consequences of many of the listed examples. For instance, many SIFMA members, as well as other registrants, carry cybersecurity insurance that will provide coverage for financial losses as a result of a cybersecurity incident. Moreover, the four business day deadline to disclose after determining materiality will tend to incentivize registrants to err on the side of over reporting and lower the proper threshold for materiality determinations. We recommend the Commission clarify that registrants traditional assessments concerning materiality (including available mitigation), and analysis thereof, will continue to apply.  ii. Other Prudential Cybersecurity Regulators Have Prescribed Definitions of Security Incidents and Carry the Risk of Public Disclosure  The Proposals examples of security incidents are broad and vague and should be clarified. Several prudential cybersecurity regulators have narrowly defined examples of significant security incidents with correspondingly high thresholds. Importantly, these regulators will not publicly share the details of such disclosures. For instance,  • The newly passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) will require reporting of a significant cyber incident, or a group of related cyber incidents … likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the people of the United States.25 • The Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently announced a final rule requiring banks to notify their primary regulator of any significant computer security incident that disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade, the viability of the banking organizations operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, or impact the stability of the financial sector.26 The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) Cybersecurity Regulation defines a cybersecurity event as any act or attempt, whether successful or not, to gain unauthorized access to, disrupt, or misuse an information system or information stored on such system.27 DFS requires reporting of Cybersecurity Events if the event falls into one of two categories: (1) the Cybersecurity Event impacts the Covered Entity and notice of it is required to be provided to any government body, self regulatory agency or any  25 Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, Section 2240(16)(emphasis added). 26 See Final Rule: Computer Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank Service Providers, available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/news issuances/news releases/2021/2021 119a.pdf (emphasis added).  27 See Cybersecurity Resource Center, NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, available at https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry guidance/cybersecurity (last visited May 9, 2022) (emphasis added). 16  other supervisory body; or (2) the Cybersecurity Event has a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the normal operation(s) of the Covered Entity.28 iii. Registrants Public Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents May Cause an Unwarranted Negative Impact on a Stocks Price According to the latest data breach report by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach in 2021 was $4.24 million.29 The costs of a cybersecurity incident of course vary—and several SIFMA members have compensating controls in place to protect against the Commissions listed examples. Indeed, security incidents do not necessarily, or predictably, cause significant impact on the price of a registrants stock. Because the Proposals definition of materiality is so vague, it will incentivize over disclosure, and disclosure to the SEC and the public may be the only event that causes a negative impact on the stocks price. Additionally, criminal groups may exploit price impacts of data breaches that they cause based on their belief that SEC reporting requirements will result in public disclosures of cybersecurity incidents even if they are not really material.  e. The SECs Proposal Conflicts with Federal, State and International Data Breach Notification and Cyber Event Reporting Laws  Both in Timing and Substantive Standards; the Disconnect Between Disclosures to Impacted Data Subjects and Investors May Be Problematic. Request for Comment 6. The reporting requirements under the proposed rule are not aligned with other federal, state, and international cybersecurity incident reporting requirements. The explicit lack of a law enforcement (and national security and cybersecurity agency) exemption is concerning and could undermine national, corporate, and personal security interests. It is also inconsistent with existing cyber notification requirements that do allow for such exemptions. Each Registrant has a number of obligations under either federal or state law in the case of a security incident. The Proposal may add another compliance burden  with a significantly shorter period of time than most other regulations to report the incident to the Commission. The Commission should consider aligning its reporting obligations with other state and federal laws. f. Updates to Previously Disclosed Cybersecurity Incidents and Previously Immaterial Cybersecurity Incidents Present an Inherent Risk.  Under the Proposal, registrants would be required to provide additional reports where material changes, additions, or updates have occurred with respect to a cybersecurity incident. However, the comments include statements, such as a description of remedial steps [a company] has taken, or plans to take, in response to the incident.30 In many cases, that will not be a material change or update and should not require additional reporting. Such a report may also be contrary to the SECs statement that in an initial 8 K filings related to a cybersecurity  28 Id. 29 See How much does a data breach cost?, IBM, available at https://www.ibm.com/security/data breach (last visited May 9, 2022). 30 The Proposal. 17  incident the SEC would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident.31 The requirement to update reports should be limited to only significantly new or different information relating to a cybersecurity incident. That determination of materiality should be left to a companys discretion based on the same factors used to determine materiality under previous SEC guidance. The Proposal should also address when updates could stop being made—for instance, at the point which the incident itself is no longer material. Any updates of ongoing cybersecurity investigations could be misleading. Investigations are complex and dynamic, and a registrants understanding of information is always evolving. Information around registrants progress in remediating an incident is also valuable information to any malicious actor. SIFMA is concerned with the requirement to speculate on any potential future material impacts on operations and financial condition given the complex and dynamic nature of cybersecurity incidents. SIFMA does not agree that required reporting on the details of remediation measures is appropriate. In general, these measures should remain internal as the details of remediation may themselves expose areas of vulnerability, and they may not be properly understood by, and could be misleading for, inexpert shareholders or potential investors. Cybersecurity regulatory agencies  not the SEC  should focus on the specifics of remediation.  The proposed addition of Item 106(d)(2) would require a company to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate.32 It is unclear what would constitute a series of previously undisclosed cybersecurity incidents. For example, if similar types of attacks are conducted against the same company by different actors over the course of a year, or even a longer period, it is not clear if that would be considered a series of cybersecurity incidents. It would also not be clear if the same threat actor conducted multiple attacks over a period of time. Similarly, it may not be clear if different government linked advanced persistent threats conducted attacks whether it should be considered a series of cybersecurity incidents (e.g., Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, both of which have been linked to Russia). Material in the aggregate is difficult to define (it has not been explicitly defined by the SEC) and operationally challenging to follow. The definition of cybersecurity incident refers to any information so this would require potentially reviewing unlimited amounts of data over an indefinite period of time. This lack of clarity could cause a compliance risk of over or under reporting. And perhaps most significantly, many disclosed cybersecurity incidents do not turn out to be material to investment decisions. The SECs Proposal should acknowledge that empirical reality. g. Considerations for Foreign Private Issuers. Comment 38, 39. The proposed change to Form 6 K will result in a potentially onerous requirements for foreign private issuers and many other in the European Union that are subject to Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) continuous disclosure requirements to immediately disclose non public  31 Id. 32 Id. 18  price sensitive information. The proposed change to Form 6 K implies that all cyber incidents reported under the Proposal are material for US SEC purposes. To minimize potential selective disclosure issues, covered foreign private issuers (FPI) would be best advised to make the home country and Form 6 K announcements concurrently. As MAR requires immediate announcement, then that determines the timeframe within which FPIs must respond, which is immensely challenging given the likely imperfect information FPIs will have about the incident.  US registrants generally have four business days to file an 8 K. So, in this instance the Proposal would operate potentially capriciously for FPIs subject to MAR type home country real time disclosure requirements.  We suggest that the inclusion of material cybersecurity incidents is not made to Form 6 K. If home country rules require immediate disclosure of the incident, then US security holders will receive the 6 K concurrently even without the proposed change.  IV. Disclosure Requirements  Existing SEC guidance should be sufficient to elicit relevant information for investors, and if needed could be supplemented to include principles based discussion of cybersecurity risk management and strategy. The Proposal seems more in line with prudential regulators and reach beyond typical SEC disclosure requirements. The Commission should be circumspect about what type of information is being forced into the public domain, which will be available to malicious actors and overly technical for investors. The requirement for a registrant to provide information about its cybersecurity program should be limited to a brief description of: (1) whether the registrant has a cybersecurity program; and (2) a high level description of the various components of the cybersecurity program or a reference to the cybersecurity framework employed by the registrant. Detailed descriptions of the components, including for conducting cybersecurity due diligence on vendors, creates an additional burden on companies without a clear benefit to investors or to the effectiveness of a companys cybersecurity program. The Commission should deem it sufficient disclosure for registrants to refer generally to the cybersecurity frameworks they follow, such as ISO 27001 Certification or SOC 2 Reports.  a. Board and Governance Disclosure Requirements Are Unduly Prescriptive, Overbroad and Overinclusive, and Could Deny Companies the Ability to Adopt and Follow Their Own Cybersecurity Strategies, Operating Procedures and Alternative Approaches; Identifying Specific Individuals by Name (Even With SECs Proposed Safe Harbor) May Deter Qualified Individuals and Invite Unfair Accountability. Request for Comment 17, 20, 26, and 27. i. The Proposals Item 106 of Regulation S K and Item 16J of Form 20 F Create an Undue Administrative Burden on Registrants With Limited Benefit to Investors 19  The proposal includes requirements for issuers to disclose information such as: the cybersecurity expertise of its board members; the registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures; whether it employs a chief information security officer; and the interactions of management and the board of directors concerning cybersecurity. This will create an administrative burden and lead to companies designing policies and procedures for purposes of SEC reporting rather than broader compliance goals based on risks specific to an organization. If anything, this could become misleading for investors, because a company can list its policies and procedures which could create a false sense of security for investors, even though the detail about the policies has no bearing on their effectiveness. The Commission should consider general references to implementation of industry standards such as ISO 27001 Certification or SOC 2 Reports as sufficient disclosure. As discussed by Commissioner Peirces Dissenting Statement, these disclosure requirements look more like a list of expectations about what issuers cybersecurity programs should look like and how they should operate. We support businesses integration of cybersecurity expertise and decision making through their board members and management, as well as other measures in the proposal, but these decisions should be left to businesses. Although it does not seem to be expressly addressed in the Proposal, the SEC should make clear that this disclosure requirement does not require companies to disclose whether they maintain cyber insurance. Malicious actors look for that type of information to tailor cyber attacks toward particular organizations that are more likely to pay ransom when they carry cyber insurance.  Additionally, such policies are relatively new and the ultimate scope of coverage may be uncertain.  ii. The Proposals Amendments to Item 407 of Regulation S K and Form 20 F to Create Prescriptive Public Disclosures of a Registrants Board of Directors Experience and Involvement in Cybersecurity Will Mislead Investors  Requiring disclosure of cybersecurity expertise for a member of the board of directors may be difficult for many registrants to implement—especially depending on the size of the registrant. Board of directors are distinct from management, as the boards role is one of oversight whereas management is required to have subject matter expertise. The Proposal fundamentally changes the role of the board of directors in a way that is untenable. The board should have the flexibility to determine its own composition and take into consideration the collective expertise of the board, holistically. Boards are, by design, deliberative bodies and tasked with oversight of numerous risks  of which cyber is only one of those risks. Special interest board members are not the best way to advance the oversight of a registrant or of a board as a deliberative and collective body; therefore, the Proposal could undermine this model.  Current disclosures required concerning boards business experience should be sufficient to elicit relevant information for investors. SIFMA recommends the commission provide an alternative method of disclosure, such as whether the board of directors engages in regular cybersecurity education sessions or engages with expert advisers on the topic.  Appointing a cybersecurity expert should be an individual judgment for individual companies in light of their structure, sophistication, and relevant risks. There is also a potential sourcing issue  there may be not be sufficient people with cybersecurity expertise and requisite 20  board skills (in some cases C Suite level). It is also far from clear that the types of expertise provided as examples (e.g., having a cybersecurity certification or degree) is necessary for effective oversight of cybersecurity matters. This could be misleading and create a false sense of confidence among investors, because a company without board members with cybersecurity expertise may have an extremely knowledgeable CISO and other information security staff. Yet the absence of a board member with specific credentials or past experience may unjustifiably impact the perceived risk exposure of a registrant. The SEC should simply not specify how public companies must go about discharging their cybersecurity responsibilities. We recommend the Commission lighten its language on this requirement to ensure that this does not transform into a mandate for every registrant to have a cybersecurity expert on its board. The Commission proposes requiring disclosure of any cybersecurity expertise of board members and disclosing the names of those directors with expertise. Disclosing the names of board members with cybersecurity expertise could draw unwanted attention to these board members, including from bad actors (e.g., hacktivists) or litigants, and could thereby discourage board memberships. b. Public Disclosures Concerning Whether and How Cybersecurity Considerations Affect the Selection and Oversight of Third Party Service Providers May Have Severe or Significant Detrimental Security Implications.  Public disclosure on whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect registrants selection and oversight of third parties should only be provided at a very high level, as detailed information could provide a roadmap to vulnerabilities and thematic, widespread breaches should malicious actors detect patterns of selection. More specifically, we do not have concerns in terms of complying with the SECs policies and procedures expectations. However, public disclosure should be limited to confirmation that policies and procedures are appropriately applied to third party selection and ongoing oversight as part of a risk based framework covering the relationship life cycle. Disclosure should not require detailing the mechanisms, controls and contractual details leveraged to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to providers. This could expose firms and their clients/employees to additional cyber risk  the opposite of what the SEC/regulators are aiming for in building sector resilience. Further, exposing this information could put firms at a competitive disadvantage if information about their outsourcing policies, procedures, and service provider list is disclosed publicly (i.e, made available to competitors).  Additionally, companies may have confidentiality agreements in place with such third parties and would be violating the terms of these agreements if they were to publicly disclose such information. Moreover, CISA, and other cybersecurity agencies and security professionals, mitigate the harm of destructive disclosures by implementing Traffic Light Protocols (TLP), which is a set of designations used to indicate expected sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients of sensitive information.33 Indeed, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 201534 codifies the confidentiality necessary to enhance, and protect, sharing of cybersecurity threat actors and defensive measures by stating that an entity receiving a cyber threat indicator or defensive measure from another entity or Federal entity shall comply with otherwise lawful  33 See Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Definitions and Usage, CISA, available at https://www.cisa.gov/tlp.  34 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 113, Div. N, Title I (2015). 21  restrictions placed on the sharing or use of such cyber threat indicator or defensive measure by the sharing entity or Federal entity.35 c. Different Companies Require Different Levels of Cybersecurity Investment and Sophistication. Request for Comment 23 and 35. As discussed, the topics listed in the proposed governance disclosures come off as expectations. However, all these measures will not be required for all registrants, as each registrant will have a different risk profile. For instance, a registrant that does not collect sensitive information or that exists entirely in a third party cloud environment may not need all the cybersecurity measures listed in the proposal. On the other hand, a registrant that deals with sensitive information, such as childrens data or Social Security numbers, may need additional cybersecurity controls. By creating a one size fits all form, investors may get the wrong impression of the relative risk of certain registrants. Accordingly, these required disclosures may negatively impact certain registrants that do not require sophisticated cybersecurity controls and governance, and lead investors to believe such registrants are not well positioned with respect to cybersecurity risk governance. Additionally, several types of reporting companies already have different reporting requirements. For instance, Federal Banking Regulators and other agencies require certain registrants to certify cybersecurity compliance regularly. Similarly, many state financial services and/or insurance regulators already require regulated entities certify cybersecurity compliance.  The Commission should consider exemptions or tailored reporting requirements for registrants that are regulated by different cybersecurity regulators.  d. Public Disclosures Concerning the Details of a Registrants Cybersecurity Program may have Severe or Significant Detrimental Security Implications. Request for Comment 21, 22, 28, and 31. These proposed disclosures may inadvertently lead to cybersecurity incidents. The Proposal may provide threat actors with a road map to potential vulnerabilities in registrants cyber controls and associate information systems. Prior to engaging with a target, threat actors will often use open source intelligence (OSINT) to learn more about their target.36 While the proposed cybersecurity disclosures will likely have little impact on investors, they may provide significant intelligence to malicious threat actors. We can foresee threat actors using SEC disclosures to target registrants with unsophisticated cybersecurity programs. For instance, a threat actor may target a company that disclosed it is in the process of implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, or a company that disclosed that its chief information security officer unexpectedly quit, and the position is currently vacant.   35 Id. Sec.104(b)(1)(B). 36 See Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), CROWDSTRIKE (Feb. 25, 2022), available at https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity 101/osint open source intelligence/. 22  V. Harmonized Definitions for the SECs Next Iteration (i.e., a Revised Proposed Rule) Per footnote 80 of the Proposal, the defined terms are derived from a number of established sources. While we appreciate the Commissions effort to leverage terms and definitions from established sources, we encourage the Commission to go a step further and directly adopt well established and industry accepted terms and definitions from a single source (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology or Financial Stability Board37) to promote consistency of rule interpretation and disclosure across public companies. Doing so will help registrants reduce the time utilized for internal deliberation over the Commissions terminology when making time sensitive disclosures. VI. Proposed Safe Harbor for Information Systems Provided by Suppliers and Third Parties The Commissions proposed definition of information systems includes systems that are used by the registrant, placing an unfair onus on registrants to accurately disclose to investors information possessed by a third party. Many registrants use third parties, such as cloud service providers, and may not have complete visibility into such information systems, and may be subject to intellectual property rights and cybersecurity confidentiality. Incidents and vulnerabilities often entail complex relationships among the relevant parties that constrain information sharing on legal grounds.  We recommend the SEC avoid imposing any reporting requirements with regard to cybersecurity information controlled by third parties. However, if the SEC were to impose any disclosure requirements dependent on third parties, we encourage the Commission to provide registrants a safe harbor for disclosures related to cybersecurity incidents occurring on or conducted through suppliers and third party systems, as well as other relevant cybersecurity disclosures related to third party systems. For instance, the Commission recently included a safe harbor in The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors for emissions related data derived from suppliers and third parties, recognizing concerns that registrants may have about liability for information that would be derived largely from third parties in a registrants value chain. 38  Here, a proposed safe harbor would offer registrants protection from legal liability or other penalties when a registrant is given inaccurate or incomplete information from a third party vendor related to a cybersecurity incident or other information necessary for disclosure. Such a safe harbor may encourage registrants to provide meaningful information for investors without increasing the risk of liability for information received from third parties.  37 See Cyber Lexicon, FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (Nov. 12, 2018), available at https://www.fsb.org/2018/11/cyber lexicon/.  38 See The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, 87 Fed. Reg. 21334 (proposed Apr. 11, 2022) (to be codified at 17 CFR 210, 229, 232, 239, and 249) (providing a safe harbor to registrants from forms of liability under the securities laws given challenges in obtaining activity data from suppliers and third parties). 23  VII. Costs of Compliance. We recommend the Commission account for the relative costs and benefits of this Proposal in light of the inevitable duplication with the regulation and responsibilities of other more expert and relevant agencies. SIFMA members have already substantially invested in cybersecurity compliance and best practices. For instance, many SIFMA members have aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, but the Proposals lack of alignment and harmonization with NIST or other cybersecurity frameworks may cause SIFMA members to expend substantial resources to reconcile these best practices with the Proposal. This resulting burden and complexity distract cybersecurity professionals from identifying and protecting against the threat environment, and undermines the design of cybersecurity strategies and prioritization of control implementation.39 This Proposal will bring limited benefits to investors as well as to SIFMA members cybersecurity programs, while providing substantial compliance costs to registrants. * * *  SIFMA appreciates the SECs attention to cybersecurity, and absolutely agrees with the Commission regarding the importance of cybersecurity commitment and resources. However, we respectfully submit the Proposal has mistaken the SECs proper role on cybersecurity for public companies. The SEC is not and should not seek to become a cybersecurity regulator for public companies, and should focus more narrowly on assuring that investors receive information material to their investment decisions. Accordingly, SIFMA respectfully urges that the Commission should issue a revised notice of proposed rulemaking in line with its proper, limited role on cybersecurity in the public company context rather than proceed to a final rule. If you have any questions or would like to discuss these comments further, please reach out to Melissa Macgregor at  or Thomas Wagner at .  Sincerely,  Melissa MacGregor Managing Director & Associate General Counsel SIFMA  39 See Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, RE: Views on the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Security, FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR COORDINATING COUNCIL (Feb. 9, 2016) (Industry has a shared concern that the fundamentals of cybersecurity are weakened when, as some firms have reported, approximately 40% of corporate cybersecurity activities are compliance oriented, rather than security oriented. The solution is not merely hiring more cybersecurity personnel as expert staff are becoming an increasingly scarce and costly resource.). 24  Thomas M Wagner Managing Director, Financial Services Operations and Technology SIFMA cc:  Hon.

Discussion and Recommendations (i) Form 8 K Reporting Trigger and Timing for Disclosure of Material Cybersecurity Incidents  The SEC has proposed to amend Form 8 K to add new Item 1.05, which would require a registrant to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four business days after determining that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. In proposing such a requirement, the Commission notes that such reporting would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures. While Business Roundtable appreciates the importance of timely and comparable disclosures, investors only benefit when there is decision useful information that can be provided.  Following the initial discovery of a cyber incident, there is often a dearth of confirmed information and resources are best deployed to identify and mitigate the harm from a cybersecurity incident versus managing external communications concerning the incident.  Much of what is believed to be the case in the initial days, or even weeks, following an incident will not ultimately be complete and/or accurate and thus will not provide investors with decision useful information. Rather, premature public disclosure will often cause investors more harm than good because investors will be forced to make decisions based on incomplete and potentially inaccurate information and without full context for other aspects of the registrants operations, including critical response and remediation efforts. The Commission has acknowledged this concern, noting in the Proposals that a registrants disclosure about an May 9, 2022 Page 3 3  incident could lack the precision needed for investors and the market to properly value the securities, potentially leading to information uncertainty, investor under or overreaction to certain disclosures, and thereby mispricing of registrants securities. Disclosure before determining the nature and magnitude of information accessed (even when enough is known to reasonably expect the incident is material) will also lead to questions the registrant is incapable of answering, leading to additional risks and reputational harm. The confusion and uninformed market speculation resulting from such disclosure will force the registrant to deal with harmful volatility in its stock while trying to manage through the cyber incident. Not only would premature disclosure be harmful to investors, it could exacerbate the respective registrant and/or stakeholder harms stemming from the original attack. Forcing public companies to engage in disclosure about incidents while in the midst of incident response and remediation could have significant unintended consequences. For example, in the case of a ransomware attack, such disclosures could adversely impact a registrants ransomware negotiation position and strategy. In addition, disclosure of the information that would be required under the Proposals could increase the risk of additional or more aggressive attacks and worsen the overall impact of the incident being reported. In the case of the latter, the proposed new Form 8 K trigger (a determination of materiality) will in many cases occur before remediation, which could lead the threat actor to increase their efforts to exploit the existing vulnerability before it can be remediated or invite new threat actors to exploit the vulnerability. Disclosing an incident too early also could jeopardize an investigation by tipping off the threat actor, allowing them time to destroy indicators of the compromise and/or evidence of data accessed or taken. Furthermore, when the incident relates to a widely used third party system, requiring individual registrants that use that system to make disclosure acknowledging they are affected will increase the likelihood that a threat actor will seek to exploit the vulnerability. Absent this disclosure, potential threat actors (whether the original hacker or a different hacker) may not know who the third partys customers are, nor fully understand the extent to which their attack has impacted the systems under attack. Thus, the proposed disclosures could multiply the risks for the involved parties, including by causing actual harm to the affected public company and thereby its shareholders and other stakeholders such as customers and employees. Compounding these problems, the Proposals unnecessarily increase the risk of frivolous litigation from plaintiffs lawyers regarding the timing of, and manner by which, a public company determines it experienced a material cybersecurity incident given the four day reporting requirement. For all of these reasons, Business Roundtable urges the SEC to reevaluate the proposed trigger, scope and timing for current reporting of cybersecurity incidents. Balancing these concerns and conflicting purposes is a complicated task and flexibility for the registrants is needed to address these risks. We maintain that disclosure of this sensitive information presents considerable risks and stands in contrast with security best practices. Accordingly, Business Roundtable urges that the SEC adopt a disclosure standard that better takes into account these concerns.  For example, an alternative to the approach proposed could be to require Form 8 K reporting of May 9, 2022 Page 4 4 material cybersecurity incidents only once the registrant, pursuant to an obligation under applicable law, publicly notifies persons outside the registrant or when a registrant voluntarily elects to make disclosure. At a minimum, the SEC should allow for reporting to occur after the registrant has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to and resolve the incident. Law Enforcement/National Security/Registrant Security/Public Safety Carveout Further, we believe it is imperative that the reporting requirement include a law enforcement, national security, and other defensive measures exception that applies when the registrant (i) reasonably believes a particular disclosure may prejudice its efforts to defend itself against threat actors or remediate the incident or (ii) has been informed by governmental or regulatory authorities that delay of disclosure at that time would be in the interest of national security and/or that disclosure at that time would hinder law enforcement efforts to identify or capture the threat actor. In this regard, we note that the SEC acknowledges in the proposing release that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents, but concludes that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors would justify not providing for a reporting delay. We do not believe the Proposals reflect the appropriate balancing of these important interests or that a registrant should be placed in the untenable position of harming its ability to defend/protect itself, impeding law enforcement efforts and/or imperiling national security as a result of an inflexible reporting requirement that results in premature (and thus potentially harmful to investor interests) disclosure. Failure to include a law enforcement exception could directly harm the investors that the disclosure requirement is presumably intended to protect. It is not difficult to imagine a situation where premature disclosure of an incident could impact the ability of law enforcement to seize the ill gotten gains of a criminal actor, which could have been used to compensate victims, including the public company required to make the disclosure. Similarly, a public safety carveout should be considered for safety critical industries. A premature disclosure of an automobile, airplane, or medical device vulnerability could cause individuals to make safety related decisions based on incomplete information  deferring medical procedures or travel, or disconnecting certain types of devices. We believe our suggested alternative approach would better balance the significant law enforcement and national security considerations without harming investor protection and take into account the significant investor harm that can result from premature disclosure of a cybersecurity incident. May 9, 2022 Page 5 5  Definition of Information Systems  The Proposals broadly define information systems as information resources, owned or used by the registrant, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations. As used in the Proposals, this broad definition potentially sweeps in a wide range of incidents, likely including those involving cloud infrastructure and service providers where registrants may have limited information because the registrant is not empowered to conduct an investigation. As many third party information system arrangements are not set up today to allow for the information flow that is needed to comply with the proposed cyber incident Form 8 K reporting, Business Roundtable believes the scope of the disclosure requirements must be narrowed to capture only those information resources within the registrants direct control (or third party information resources beyond the registrants direct control should otherwise be excepted from the new disclosure requirements). In addition, a phase in period would be necessary to give registrants and vendors time to assess and develop systems to comply with these new disclosure obligations and the SEC should provide more clarity around which party in these situations has the disclosure obligation (once a material cybersecurity incident has been identified and assuming no national security or other exceptions apply, as discussed above).  (ii) Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents That Have Become Material in the Aggregate  The Proposals would require a company to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate, with registrants required to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both individually and in the aggregate. Business Roundtable views this aspect of the Proposals as unworkable and of questionable overall value. The requirement provides no temporal limits and would necessitate challenging and potentially imprecise judgments regarding whether incidents are related, which would be a complex undertaking in the context of the myriad of cybersecurity incidents experienced by companies every day. This requirement also could put companies at a unique disadvantage with respect to potential attackers, letting those attackers know what attempts were successful, or providing ideas for future targets. It also would impose significant costs on registrants to track immaterial incidents to determine whether an after the fact examination of the incidents might lead to a conclusion that the incidents were somehow related.  (iii) Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy  The Proposals would require new disclosures in Form 10 K of a companys policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risk, the boards oversight of risk and managements role in assessing and managing risk. Much of the proposed annual disclosure on cybersecurity risk management and strategy has the potential to expose sensitive, confidential May 9, 2022 Page 6 6 information about a registrants cybersecurity program, such as the scope and frequency of testing or assessment, the nature of its third party engagements or systems, its operating environment, specific mitigation and remediation activities, and more. Such disclosures could be exploited by bad actors. Such disclosures also would subject registrants to second guessing of their procedures and disclosure regarding such procedures by plaintiffs firms, regulators and others when, as is virtually inevitable at this point, a cybersecurity incident does occur. For these reasons, Business Roundtable urges that the rules make clear that broad summary descriptions of policies and programs should suffice and reiterate that information that would provide a roadmap to bad actors looking for vulnerabilities to exploit need not be disclosed under the new requirements. Further, with regard to board oversight aspects of the Proposals, such disclosure is generally more appropriately provided in proxy materials than in the Form 10 K. Accordingly, we urge that registrants be given the flexibility to provide such disclosure in their proxy materials, similar to the cyber expertise disclosure. (iv) Support for Proposed Safe Harbor and Approach to Form S 3 Eligibility  As is proposed, and as is the case with other Form 8 K items that require a registrant to assess the materiality of an event or to determine whether a disclosure obligation has been triggered, any required disclosure regarding a cybersecurity incident should have the benefit of the safe harbors from liability and should not impact a companys ability to use short form registration statements on Form S 3. Accordingly, Business Roundtable supports the Proposals approach to liability and Form S 3 liability. (v) Disclosures Should Be Furnished Versus Filed  Finally, given the complex, dynamic and often lengthy nature of cybersecurity incident investigations, the new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K should be considered furnished rather than filed and should not be automatically subject to liability for material misstatements or omissions in SEC filings under Section 18 of the Exchange Act or automatically incorporated by reference in registration statements under the Securities Act (unless the company specifically elects it to be considered filed or incorporates it by reference into an SEC filing as permitted by current Form 8 K rules). Allowing the Form 8 K to be furnished would be more appropriate given that the information surrounding a cybersecurity incident is likely to evolve over the course of the related investigation.  (vi) Cybersecurity Expertise  The Proposals would amend Item 407 of Regulation S K to add a requirement to provide disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors of the registrant. While the Proposals do not define cybersecurity expertise, the SEC has provided a non exclusive list of criteria that a registrant should consider in reaching a determination on whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity: May 9, 2022 Page 7 7 • Whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity (e.g., prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst, security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident response manager, or business continuity planner). • Whether the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity. • Whether the director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity (e.g., in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning).  We agree that disclosure about the skills, background and expertise of board members is important information for our investors, along with disclosure of oversight regarding risk management. In fact, many of our member companies already provide disclosure regarding the cybersecurity expertise of board members and how boards oversee, and company leadership manages, cybersecurity risk. That said, we caution against an ever expanding set of disclosure requirements regarding specific skills without regard to the materiality of that particular skill to the registrant. Further, we do not believe that the proposed disclosure requirements regarding cybersecurity expertise are necessary at this time. The proposed rules would require a registrant not only to disclose whether any directors have expertise in cybersecurity, but also to provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise. If the Commission determines that this proposed disclosure requirement is necessary and appropriate, we urge the Commission to revise the proposed non exclusive list of criteria for determining cyber expertise because the list of criteria is unduly narrow. While we understand that the list is non exclusive, as the Commission knows, such lists often become the rule and registrants that are working to comply with a new disclosure requirement will look to that list as indicative of what the SEC expects. Accordingly, Business Roundtable believes the list should be expanded, including to (i) acknowledge the value of previous experience managing cybersecurity functions and leading organizations through data security incidents (similar to the SEC acknowledgement that a CEO is an Audit Committee Financial Expert whether or not the person is an accountant because they have had oversight of the accounting function at their company); and to (ii) to recognize adjacent skills, such as in technology. More broadly, the proposed list fails to recognize the oversight function exercised by boards as compared to the management of cybersecurity incidents or programs required at the executive and working levels. Companies do not need directors who are experts at forensic data analysis or similar technical aspects of incident response. Instead, companies benefit from directors who have significant leadership and risk management experience and have demonstrated a capacity to learn new skills and expertise. Otherwise, the SEC risks driving companies to create boards filled with specialty directors who have deep but narrow knowledge and struggle to fulfill the broad oversight and related duties required today.

Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 2 This information is used in a wide variety of essential business operations but also makes apartment firms a target of malicious actors. Given the ever expanding cyber threat landscape, the apartment industry has made defense against these vulnerabilities a top priority. We have undertaken efforts within the apartment industry to mitigate cybersecurity risks, to implement policies to prevent and mitigate such risks, and to encourage investments in bolstering cyber defenses to protect data. To those ends, we have commissioned white papers on the threat landscape and provide resources and best practices for the apartment industry. NMHC and NAA are broadly supportive of the SECs efforts to American businesses to bolster cybersecurity and to ensure that investors receive comparable material information regarding companies cyber risk management and incidents. However, our comments provided herein concern specific elements of the Proposed Rule that are overly burdensome given the complexity of cybersecurity incidents and that may result in increased cyber risks and liability for public companies. Executive Summary The Proposed Rule imposes overly burdensome requirements and requires companies to assume unnecessary, but significant, legal and cybersecurity risks. The following details our concerns, which are addressed in more depth in the Detailed Discussion section below: 1. The Proposed Rules detailed reporting requirement concerning a companys cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures unnecessarily exacerbates cybersecurity risks. 2. The broad scope of the Proposed Rules reporting requirements at the time of an incident and in subsequent quarterly and annual reports are overly burdensome. 3. The disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident before the threat actor has been fully neutralized can create additional vulnerabilities and legal risks for a company. 4. The Proposed Rule fails to provide clear direction regarding how a company should evaluate the cybersecurity practices of third party service providers. 5. The Proposed Rule does not include a comprehensive safe harbor provision, which is necessary to encourage disclosure and best efforts to meet compliance standards. Detailed Discussion 1. Detailed Disclosure of Cybersecurity Risk Management Policies and Procedures Enhances Cybersecurity Risks. The Proposed Rule amends several of the Commissions quarterly and annual reporting forms and rules (Forms 10 K, 10 Q, 20 F, 8 K, or 6 K and 2 APARTMENTS WE LIVE HERE. lnSEyeS1. NW, Su11e1100 I WHh ngtor,.OC 2000o I  WeAreApar1ment5.or9 Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 3 Regulation S K) for public companies to require additional cybersecurity related information to be disclosed publicly to potential investors. 4 The Proposed Rule would add disclosure requirements regarding cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, and cybersecurity governance, including oversight and cyber expertise of the Board of Directors. 5 In an effort to achieve greater transparency, the Proposed Rule seeks to require registrants to provide more consistent and informative disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management and strategy.6 The Proposed Rule, thus, requires a description of a registrants cyber risk assessment program and activities undertaken to prevent, detect, and minimize cybersecurity incidents, as well as how cybersecurity incidents have or are likely to affect the registrants strategy, business model, results of operations, or financial condition and how cybersecurity risks are part of the business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation. 7 Such specific and detailed public disclosures unintentionally and unnecessarily identify a companys cybersecurity vulnerabilities and enhance a companys cybersecurity risks. It would be naive of us to dismiss such disclosures are more valuable to investors than cybercriminals, who will likely use this publicly available information in designing targeted attacks. Indeed, what is transparent to an investor will be transparent to sophisticated cybercriminals and nation state actors. NMHC and NAA support the disclosure of relevant, high level information about an issuers cyber risk management policies and procedures; however, registrants should not be required to report detailed descriptions of their internal cybersecurity plans, which could compromise their defenses. A companys cyber risk management and strategy can be summarized at a high level without disclosing the level of detail sought by the Proposed Rule. Therefore, we urge the SEC to revise the required disclosures in proposed Item 106(b) of Regulation S K to provide a general, high level understanding of the attention and resources dedicated to cybersecurity without the details of the cybersecurity program and its strategies, activities, and defenses 2. The Incident Reporting Requirements Are Overly Burdensome and Require Greater Flexibility. The Proposed Rule requires public disclosures of material cybersecurity incidents within four business days after a registrant determines that it experienced such an incident. In addition, registrants are required to provide periodic updates concerning the material cybersecurity incident. These disclosures require detailed information about the cybersecurity incident, including whether data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purposes. 4 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 18 20, available at https:/lwww.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 5 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 55, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 6 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 35, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 7 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 107, available at https:/lwww.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 3 APARTMENTS WE LIVE HERE. lnSEyeS1. NW, Su11e1100 I WHh ngtor,.OC 2000o I WeAreApaomentJ.org Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page4 The scope and timing of this incident reporting requirement are overly burdensome and unnecessarily prescriptive. Upon discovering a cybersecurity incident, companies immediately dedicate resources to contain, investigate, and eradicate the threat. Forensics investigations of a cybersecurity incident are often conducted in anticipation of litigation and under attorney client and work product privilege. While these efforts are underway, most companies do not have a comprehensive awareness of the facts or the implications of the breach. Requiring detailed cybersecurity incident disclosures, especially within a short window, pulls resources away from these efforts and could result in an unintentional waiver of privilege. As the investigation continues to discover new information, this could result in a cascade of additional reporting obligations. Moreover, prior disclosures may no longer be accurate, which could require constant corrections and could result in potential liability if deemed misleading. The Proposed Rule also applies to an incident involving information resources owned or used by the registrant. Thus, registrants are also responsible for making a materiality decision for incidents involving third party systems. 8 This requirement is overly broad and burdensome to registrants who do not control or have access to these information systems. Additionally, the lack of harmonization amongst the various incident reporting obligations is burdensome, especially for smaller businesses. Apartment firms increasingly operate across multiple states and must comply with a patchwork of 50 different state laws governing data security and breach notifications, various federal cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, and potentially foreign laws. The lack of harmonization amongst these governmental entities increases costs and causes confusion as agencies and consumers receive notifications at different times concerning the same cybersecurity incident. NMHC and NAA urge the SEC to consider greater flexibility with reporting cybersecurity incidents to reduce burdens on companies, especially concerning the details sought and the constant periodic reporting obligation. Moreover, NMHC and NAA encourage the SEC to harmonize its cybersecurity incident disclosure obligations to be consistent with other federal agencies and state laws. 3. Registrants should not be required to report a material cybersecurity incident publicly until the threat actor has been neutralized. Under the Proposed Rule, public disclosure of an incident will be required in many circumstances before the threat is contained or eradicated, which can complicate a companys response to the cybersecurity incident as well as expose it to additional cybersecurity and legal risks. For instance, a company subject to a ransomware attack may be obligated to publicly disclose the material cybersecurity incident while negotiating with the cybercriminals, which could significantly undermine its negotiation position and enhance the cybercriminals bargaining power. Alternatively, a company whose backups are not fully operational within this 4 day window may feel compelled to pay a ransom demand before public disclosure of the material cybersecurity incident, which would result in unnecessary and costly payments. 8 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 31, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 4 APARTMENTS WE LIVE HERE. lnSEyeS1. NW, Su11e1100 I WHh ngtor,.OC 2000o I WeAreApaomentJ.org Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 5 During the initial stages of a cyberattack, a company will aim to ensure that the threat has been contained and eradicated before safely rebuilding its systems and restoring operations. Public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident before eradication and remediation could create opportunities for cybercriminals to further target the victim company. Moreover, such public disclosures, without specifics that the threat has been eradicated and systems remediated, may result in speculative trading. The one size fits all reporting period, thus, may create unintentional and negative consequences. We urge the SEC to allow companies an appropriate opportunity to contain and eradicate cyber threats before requiring public disclosures of material cybersecurity incidents. 4. Provide clear guidance concerning oversight of the cybersecuritv practices of third parties. The apartment industry relies heavily on third parties not just for IT but also for numerous services (e.g., physical security systems, rental payment systems, employee payroll, embedded smart technologies, etc.). These third party vendors and service providers often collect, use, and maintain vast amounts of sensitive data about residents, prospective residents, and employees. As the apartment industry does not own or have access to the IT systems employed by these vendors and service providers, monitoring and evaluating third parties cyber hygiene continues to be a significant challenge. Although the Proposed Rule would require disclosure of a registrants policies and procedures to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with third party service providers, 9 it does not provide any parameters or guidance on how companies should conduct such activities. This third party disclosure requirement imposes a significant legal risk to a registrant as statements concerning its practices could become a potential basis for litigation and/or enforcement action if a third party service provider experience a material cybersecurity incident. The lack of clear SEC guidance on adequate oversight only enhances the challenges that companies face with monitoring and evaluating third parties cyber hygiene. Therefore, if the SEC requires companies to disclose its policies and procedures to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with third party service providers, it should provide clear guidance for evaluating a third partys cybersecurity practices. Moreover, if a company had conducted an adequate evaluation process of the third party service provider, incident reporting requirements concerning third party information systems should carry a safe harbor for registrants with respect to SEC enforcement actions and securities litigations. 5. Provide more extensive liability protections and safe harbor provisions. The Proposed Rule requires registrants to publicly report material cybersecurity incidents within four business days after determining that a material cybersecurity incident has occurred. Because management must make a rapid materiality determination to meet this requirement, the Proposed Rule extends a limited safe harbor rule for the failure to timely report a material cybersecurity incident. 10 However, this safe harbor is significantly limited. Although cybersecurity incidents are complex and constantly evolving, the Proposed Rule provides no litigation protection against 9 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 1 1038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 36, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 1° Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No. 33 11038, 87 FR 16590 (proposed March 9, 2022) at 27 28, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 5 APARTMENTS WE LIVE HERE. lnSEyeS1.

It also provides no protections related to the other disclosure requirements, such as information regarding a companys cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures. As noted earlier, the Proposed Rule offers no liability protection to registrants when third party service providers experience a material cybersecurity incident. In addition, most state data breach laws provide a safe harbor provision to permit delayed notifications when law enforcement determines that such notices will impede an investigation. However, the Proposed Rule does not adopt a similar approach even though publicly reporting a cybersecurity incident could undermine these states safe harbor provisions and potential law enforcement investigations. We strongly recommend the SEC consider expanding protections and safe harbors to companies reporting cybersecurity incidents and their cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, especially related to third party information systems. Without such protections, the Proposed Rule may result in increased costs borne upon the apartment industry, which would affect housing affordability.

Washington, DC 20549  Re:  File No. S7 09 22, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC1 (Nasdaq) appreciates the opportunity to comment on a recent proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) to require current reporting of material cybersecurity incidents to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Proposal).2 Nasdaq supports the Proposals goals to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity and agrees that cybersecurity threats pose an ongoing and escalating risk to public companies, investors, and market participants. Requiring public companies to disclose uniform information about cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices would provide investors with comparable information to assess how public companies manage cybersecurity risk, thereby promoting transparency and consistency. Nasdaq believes that investors, issuers and other market participants will benefit from healthy capital markets that promote trust and transparency. However, as Nasdaq considered the Proposal in our role as a national securities exchange serving as a listing venue, the Proposal raised some concerns for our listed companies. We received valuable feedback from our issuer community, which includes companies of various  1  The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC is registered as a national securities exchange and is wholly owned by Nasdaq, Inc. 2  See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 94382 (March 9, 2022), 87 FR 16590 (March 23, 2022) (File No. S7 05 22) (Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure). 2 sizes and market capitalizations, about issues that are important to them. Nasdaq addresses below certain concerns that are raised by this Proposal for those listed companies. Time Period For 8 K Disclosure of Cybersecurity Information Is Too Short Nasdaq received feedback from listed companies concerning the requirement to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The feedback indicated that the four business day timeframe (1) may interfere with a public companys primary obligation to remediate a cybersecurity intrusion; and (2) is an exceptionally short time period in which to understand the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach as well as its potential impact.  Once a breach of a companys information systems has been discovered, it is paramount for a company to understand the scope and nature of the cybersecurity incident and immediately commence remediation efforts to limit the amount of damage that such an incident may cause.  Time is of the essence for a company dealing with a cybersecurity incident. However, the requirements of this Proposal, including the determination of materiality itself, could distract key employees and management away from remediation efforts. In these situations, public companies should be permitted to prioritize first on protecting the companys information systems and averting further damage over other priorities. The feedback we received is that greater flexibility should be provided to public companies with respect to the timeframe to disclose a cybersecurity incident so as not to divert critical efforts away from remediation efforts.  The discovery of a potential breach of a companys information systems would trigger a series of necessary actions to arrive at a determination that a breach was material including, but not limited to, an internal investigation, extensive communication with and oversight from senior management, and the board of directors, together with communication with external parties (outside counsel, advisors, expert consultants and regulators). The four business day timeframe may not provide public companies with adequate time to investigate and formulate next steps much less prepare a fulsome and thorough disclosure and as a result, may hinder a companys investigation into a breach, potentially precluding a deliberate and systematic investigation, which could result in incorrect or incomplete conclusions being drawn early on and being disclosed within the Form 8 K. We believe disclosures that are premature, and potentially incomplete or ultimately misleading, do not further investor protection and do not promote well functioning orderly and efficient markets. Rather, incomplete or misleading disclosures have the potential to exacerbate the original harm imposed by a bad actor. Hasty disclosures forced by the need to comply with the four business day timeframe could impair both public companies and investors if investments are made based on piece meal information. Nasdaq acknowledges that in some cases more expeditious disclosure may be justified and requests the Commission consider providing some flexibility in the timing of the disclosure to allow public companies the necessary time to prepare and file more informed disclosures. Finally, public companies bear risk in making materiality determinations in a timely manner where facts and circumstances are fluid, as is the case with cybersecurity incidents.  When a material cybersecurity incident is disclosed, there will likely follow questions regarding the companys actions, including the timing of disclosure and materiality determination itself, which could further complicate, and even potentially alter, the companys investigations, 3 remediations and communications with key stakeholders. In addition, actions taken with best intentions and with information available at the time could, in hindsight, be considered mistakes.  Given this risk, Nasdaq suggests the Commission grant a safe harbor to public companies with respect to the timing of reporting and determination of materiality made in good faith. Such protection would allow public companies to conduct methodical investigations and remediations, as well as make disclosures, without the fear of being second guessed. Smaller Reporting Companies Should be Permitted Additional Time to Comply  The Proposal would require public companies to disclose policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats, including, operational risk; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk.3 As a result, public companies would need to review and adopt expanded governance policies to meet the required disclosures. Also, because a cybersecurity incident refers to any information4 residing in a companys information systems, the Proposal would impact the manner in which a public company reviews and retains data over an unlimited time period since a public company would need to necessarily monitor all incidents, whether material or not. Further, in light of the Proposal, public companies may need to attract suitably qualified individuals with cybersecurity expertise. These additional requirements may disproportionately impact smaller reporting companies with fewer resources and, as such, Nasdaq believes that the Commission should provide a longer compliance period for smaller reporting companies.  In addition, while the proposed disclosures are important, the Commission should also consider the cumulative effects of the burdens placed on public companies when imposing new requirements. Specifically, the Commission should balance the information necessary to ensure investors are kept informed against any burdens placed on public companies based on their size.  Without a proper balance, additional burdens may have the unintended impact of making public capital markets a less attractive alternative for companies that consider offering their securities to the public.  Delayed Reporting Should be Permitted Where An Investigation is Ongoing The Proposal does not provide for a reporting delay for ongoing investigations. If a potential breach was determined to be material, a public company would have concomitant obligations to communicate with customers, comply with statutory and/or regulatory obligations, and communicate with law enforcement within potentially the same four day time period to disclose a cybersecurity incident within the Form 8 K. The Proposal does not provide for a reporting delay for ongoing investigations, even when requested by law enforcement and otherwise permitted under state law and other federal laws. Disclosures of material incidents may serve to hamper an investigation where the scope of the intrusion may yet be unknown, which may strain collaboration with law enforcement. Worse, the obligation to disclose may reveal additional information to an unauthorized intruder who may still have access to the  3  See proposed Item 106(b).  4  See proposed Item 106(a).  4 companys information systems at the time the disclosure is made and potentially further harm the company.5 The Commission should strongly consider the conflicts raised by disclosure where an investigation is ongoing. 10 K Disclosures Should be Streamlined Requiring public companies to disclose policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks and governance, including board oversight, as well as managements role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing policies, procedures, and strategies within the Form 10 K would unnecessarily complicate the 10 K filing with information not specifically focused on business operations and financial performance. In 2020, the Commission adopted several amendments designed to modernize and simplify disclosure requirements pursuant to Regulation S K that apply to periodic reports, proxy statements and certain other public filings.6 These amendments have streamlined certain disclosure requirements, while also eliminating outdated or duplicative disclosures for reporting companies under Regulation S K and impacted other forms, among them the Form 10 K. The proposed cybersecurity disclosures7 could be viewed as counteracting the Commissions goal in 2020 to simplify and streamline disclosure requirements. If the Commission determines to require the 10 K disclosures, Nasdaq suggests offering public companies a choice to disclose cybersecurity policies and procedures, governance, and managements role and relevant expertise within either the Form 10 K or the proxy statement.  * * *  Nasdaq appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Commissions Proposal and applauds the Commissions actions to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding  5  New Item 1.05 would require disclosure of the following information about a material cybersecurity incident, to the extent the information is known at the time of the Form 8 K filing: (1) when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; (2) a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident; (3) whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose; (4) the effect of the incident on the registrants operations; and (5) whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. See Proposal at 16595.  6  See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89670 (August 26, 2020), 85 FR 63726 (October 8, 2020) (Modernization of Regulation S K Items 101, 103, and 105). 7  With this Proposal, public companies would be required to include, as part of their Form 10 K, disclosure of: (1) policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; (2) a cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks; and (3) managements role, and relevant expertise, in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies.

The undersigned are analysts at the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation (CCTI) at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a nonprofit, nonpartisan 501(c)(3) research institute focusing on foreign policy and national security. CCTI seeks to advance U.S. prosperity and security through technology innovation while countering cyber threats that seek to diminish it. The undersigned submits these comments in their individual capacities. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of FDD, its staff, or its advisors.  I. Summary of the Undersigned Position and Issue  By submitting these comments on the Proposed Rules, the undersigned supports the objectives of the Commission to require public companies to (1) report material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K; (2) disclose policies and procedures to identify, implement, and oversight of cybersecurity risk management, in addition to updates on previously reported cybersecurity incidents; and (3) present cybersecurity disclosures in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL).1 The Proposed Rules would revise the Commissions 2018 Cybersecurity Guidance2 by specifying a timeline for companies to notify the Commission of cyber incidents. The Proposed Rules also provide clear guidance on cybersecurity disclosures and governance, motivating companies to better protect their networks, maintain cybersecurity records, and assess risks. Through the Proposed Rules, the Commission can strengthen the resilience and fidelity of American companies by standardizing cyber incident reports, making them publicly accessible, and increasing corporate governance transparency.  We are seeing trends in how corporate cyber hygiene impacts our economy following major cyber incidents, like the SolarWinds hack. Similar to the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley Act, the Proposed Rules encourage corporate transparency on information available to investors.3 The investigation led by  1 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Company Cybersecurity; Proposed Rules, (https://www.sec.gov/files/33 11038 fact sheet.pdf)  2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC Adopts Statement and Interpretive Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, February 21, 2018.

(https://thehill.com/blogs/congress blog/technology/531781 why a sarbanes oxley update is needed to protect our financial/)  2  former Commissioner Robert Jackson found that approximately 90 percent of cyber incidents went undisclosed according to 2018 public filings and 97 percent went undisclosed in 2017.4 We believe that the Commissions Proposed Rules address these issues by emphasizing the role of corporate responsibility in mitigating systemic risks and providing guidance on cyber risk management best practices. We believe that the Proposed Rules try to achieve two things. First, it attempts to mend the communication breakdown between the United States government and the private sector. Policymakers and corporate executives disagree on policies and procedures for effective cyber risk management. Second, it addresses the problems that arise from the information gap between companies and the public. Transparency into how cyber risk impacts financial operations not only provides a holistic overview of financial performance to investors but also consistent data for the cyber insurance industry to develop accurate risk models. II. Considerations for the Commission  There are opportunities for improvements to the Proposed Rules. Specifically, the Commission should (1) identify which metrics are required for companies to assess their cyber risk; (2) define cybersecurity incidents that are material in the aggregate; and (3) specify the qualifications of board members related to cybersecurity expertise. 5 Overall, the Proposed Rules show a significant effort in encouraging cyber incident reporting and information sharing while creating public pressure on companies to improve their cybersecurity policies and procedures. a. Metrics To accurately collect information for practical gap analysis the Proposed Rule should include clear metrics that can capture the companys resilience against potential cyber risks. The key challenge is to consolidate and analyze the collected data to highlight areas for improvement in corporate governance and cyber risk management. The Commission must define what success would look like as companies from various industries develop, improve, and implement cyber risk management policies and procedures required by the Proposed Rules. In addition, regulatory scrutiny could place heavy operational burdens on companies unevenly. The Commission should consider whether these metrics can reveal an insightful analysis of cyber risk threats that public companies face. For example, cybersecurity incidents that may uniquely impact particular industries may not pose a more significant threat to companies in other sectors. b. Cybersecurity Incidents That are Material in the Aggregate  While the Proposed Rules include examples of cybersecurity incidents, registrants are left to decide whether the incident should be reported based on the importance of information to the registrants business operations and networking systems. Thus, the Commission should outline the quantitative  4 Gabriel T. Rubin, Many Company Hacks Go Undisclosed to SEC Despite Regulator Efforts. The Wall Street Journal, February 26, 2019.

In addition, the Commission should consider whether registrants can obtain and share information to determine the materiality of related incidents when using third party resources for incident management. Lastly, the Commission should specify reporting requirements for previously determined immaterial incidents that are material in the aggregate. Currently, the Proposed Rules require any information6 within the registrants systems, which could include large amounts of data collected from an unidentified period. Thus, clarifying information that registrants will need to share following a cyber incident and outlining policies and procedures for ease in determining immaterial incidents from material ones. Practical reporting requirements would include but are not limited to identifying (1) effective recordkeeping tools; (2) information needed for potential disclosure on material incidents; and (3) ways to provide updates on ongoing incidents.  c. Disclosure of Boards Governance and Expertise The Commission should consider identifying audit committee financial expert7 similar to the guidelines of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The guidelines can provide the registrants with the qualifications and expertise necessary to meet the Proposed Rules regulatory measures. In addition, the Commission should consider the limited pool of cybersecurity professionals available to meet the appropriate requirements set by the Proposed Rules. We believe that the Commissions primary intent is to ensure that registrants provide increased transparency to the public and investors through the Proposed Rules. This effort would help preserve the confidence investors place on public companies and allow the public to better evaluate their investment opportunities. The Commissions efforts will encourage companies to take corporate responsibility in mitigating cyber risks as the Proposed Rules act as measures to protect American interests.

Paylocitys comprehensive product suite delivers a unified platform for professionals to make strategic decisions in the areas of benefits, core HR, payroll, talent, and workforce management, while cultivating a modern workplace and improving employee engagement. In response to the request for public input regarding File Number S7 09 22, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incidence Disclosure, we submit the following in response to the questions provided. Question 5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold? Paylocity Response. The proposal asks if the SEC should instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain threshold. Paylocity supports this approach. Doing so would provide a reasonable and quantitative approach to defining a material incident. a quantifiable, objective measure on what triggers a reporting event. When you leave it up to the organization to decide what an investor will care about, thats too subjective and either we will end up overreporting, or rationalizing in our minds why a normal investor wouldnt care about the incident to avoid reporting altogether.  Question 8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt?  Paylocity Response. The proposal would require a registrant to make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. This would create an undue burden on security teams. Security teams are often alerted to potential security incidents multiple times a day, most of which are false positives. Time must be provided to investigate the issue, and even after confirmation of the security event, itll take considerable time and resources to contain and eradicate the event before we can think about reporting. In most privacy laws require reporting 72 hours after a confirmed breach; meaning, there has been time to fully investigate the situation, vet it that the threat is real, and then timer starts running before disclosure obligations begin.  Question 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? Paylocity Response. Registrants would not be able to reasonably obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used by not own by the Registrant. The Registrant should only be required to disclose an incident if the vulnerable third party led to a compromise of the Registrants information resources. Question 36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should consider? Paylocity Response. Paylocity supports the proposal to adopt the Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor.  Board members are not close enough to the everyday workings of the program to be held liable.

(NASAA),1 I am writing in response to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) Release No. 33 11038, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (the Proposal).2 NASAA generally supports the Proposal and encourages its adoption, with certain changes outlined below. Cybersecurity threats pose considerable risks to public companies, investors, and the U.S. markets as a whole. These risks will only increase in significance as more and more companies venture into fully digital spaces, such as the metaverse.3 For example, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. recently opened its Onyx Lounge, in the Decentraland metaverse, at which visitors to the virtual reality space can walk around and watch exclusive presentations on financial topics through their avatars.4 As more companies enter these virtual arenas, they will encounter new cybersecurity risks.

It could be an impersonation of your CEO inviting you to a meeting in a malicious virtual conference room.5 As recognized in the Proposal, cybersecurity risks are both ongoing and escalating; in many instances, these risks are existential to the companies in which investors have staked their hard earned money.6  Furthermore, large scale cybersecurity incidents can have systemic effects on the broader economy.7 NASAA is pleased to see that the SEC taking is continuing to take steps to address this issue, as it is critically important to investors and the health of our markets. The Proposal seeks to enhance and standardize disclosures from public companies about material cybersecurity incidents and companies cybersecurity risk management. It would do so, broadly, by (1) requiring companies to disclose information about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K within four days of a materiality determination, and to provide quarterly updates to those disclosures as necessary on Forms 10 Q and 10 K (collectively, the Incident Disclosures), and (2) requiring companies to disclose information annually about their policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, including the boards oversight, managements role, and the details of any cybersecurity expertise among the members of the board (collectively, the Risk Management Disclosures). I. Incident Disclosures NASAA generally supports the proposed Incident Disclosure rules. We believe that proposed new Item 1.05 on Form 8 K would provide the markets with clear, comparable, and decision useful information, and would prove to be a marked improvement from the status quo.  In particular, we appreciate that Item 1.05 would require disclosure regardless of whether the cybersecurity incident is ongoing.8 This is an area in which the existing guidance has not led to clear and consistent reporting by public companies.9 We agree that the information in Item 1.05 would be relevant to investors and other market participants and better enable all to assess the ways in which the incident might impact an investment in the reporting company. We also support the proposed requirements for public companies to include in their quarterly and annual reports any updates regarding previously reported material cybersecurity incidents, as well as information  5  Dina Bass, Microsoft Security Chief Issues Call to Arms to Protect Metaverse, Bloomberg (Mar. 28, 2022, 8:45 AM), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022 03 28/microsoft security chief urges focus on safety as metaverse is built (quoting Charlie Bell, Executive Vice President, Security, Compliance, Identity and Management, Microsoft).  6  See generally, Proposal at 5 11.  7  See Proposal at 8. 8  See proposed Item 1.05(a)(1) (requiring disclosure as to whether [the incident] is ongoing), Proposal at 127. 9  See, e.g., In re Alphabet Sec. Litig., 1 F.4th 687, 693 98 (summarizing, inter alia, the circumstances surrounding the failure to disclose software bugs in the Google+ social network that exposed private user data to third parties), 703 (rejecting the argument that the omission was not materially misleading because the software bugs had already been remediated at the time of the alleged misleading filings) (9th Cir. 2021). Vanessa Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 3 of 6  about a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents that has become material in the aggregate. We agree that a determination of materiality should be the triggering event for Form 8 K disclosure and that such a determination must be made as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.10 In our view, these provisions strike the appropriate regulatory balance between the markets need for timely information and a companys need to carefully assess the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident so that it can provide accurate, clear, and decision useful information. The Proposal acknowledges the possibility that some companies may delay making such a determination to avoid a disclosure obligation.11 We believe that the proposed requirement to make the determination as soon as reasonably practicable is a reasonable approach to address this concern and provides public companies with the appropriate degree of flexibility to conduct a thorough assessment while ensuring that the markets get timely and relevant information. Although we generally support the proposed Incident Disclosure requirements, we share the concern expressed by others that the Proposal would not provide for any reporting delay based on an ongoing external investigation related to a cybersecurity incident.12 Although the Proposal recognize[s] that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents, it rejects these concerns without analysis and concludes that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors would justify not providing for a reporting delay.13 Respectfully, we believe that this approach would ultimately harm public companies that have already been victimized or targeted, as well as their investors. We, therefore, urge the Commission to revise the Proposal so that the reporting requirements do not inadvertently undermine ongoing law enforcement efforts.  In the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident, law enforcements need for information is different from that of investors and other market participants. Law enforcement is responsible for investigating potential criminal violations with the goals of identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting the perpetrators.14 Although law enforcement agencies have many powerful tools at  10  See proposed Item 1.05(a) and Instruction 1, Proposal at 127. 11  Proposal at 22. 12  Id. at 25. See also Comm. Hester Peirce, Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal (Mar. 9, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922 (expressing concern that the Proposal is unduly dismissive of the need to cooperate with, and sometimes defer to, our partners across the federal government and state government, such as where delaying disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident could increase the chances of recovery of stolen funds or the detection of the wrongdoers in the expert opinion of law enforcement agencies[.])  13  Proposal at 25. 14  See U.S. Dept of Justice, Cybersecurity Unit, Best Practices for Victim Response and Reporting of Cyber Incidents (Best Practices for Victim Response), 14 (Sept. 2018), https://www.justice.gov/criminal ccips/file/1096971/download. Vanessa Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 4 of 6  their disposal, sometimes it is necessary to control the flow of public information in order to avoid releasing details that might impede an ongoing investigation.15 We are aware of instances in which law enforcement has requested that the victim delay public disclosure of information about the incident, or withhold certain information, so that law enforcement can identify and locate the perpetrators.16 A successful law enforcement investigation can provide substantial benefits to public companies, their investors, and the markets by apprehending the bad actors and shutting down their operation or recovering stolen assets or data.17 Accordingly, we very strongly encourage the Commission to modify the proposed rule to permit a reporting delay when such a delay is due to a bona fide request from any civil or criminal law enforcement agency to delay public disclosure about the cybersecurity incident in question.18  Such a delay could prove to be the difference between investor protection and investor harm. II. Risk Management Disclosures The Risk Management Disclosures generally fall into one of two categories. First, the Proposal would require public companies to disclose certain information about their policies, procedures, and practices, including the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk and managements role in assessing and managing those same risks. Second, the Proposal would require companies to disclose whether any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise and, if so, the name(s) of any such director(s) and such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.  NASAA supports the Risk Management Disclosures, and we encourage their adoption, with certain revisions. We anticipate that some commenters will argue that the Commission is exceeding its authority with respect to public companies and improperly seeking to regulate companies conduct and operations. We disagree and support the Commissions efforts to ensure that publicly traded companies provide investors with information about the actions they are taking to address cybersecurity risks. The information that would be required to be disclosed under the Proposal is important to investors and other market participants, especially as our economy and market participants become increasingly reliant on technology to engage with employees and customers.  It is vital to the health of our markets that public companies take steps to protect themselves by ensuring that leadership understand the risks and by putting in place the necessary policies, procedures, and action plans to protect against cyberattacks and minimize harm once it has  15  See id. at 19 (encouraging victims to contact law enforcement, noting that federal law enforcement agencies will generally coordinate public statements concerning the incident with victim companies to ensure that harmful or sensitive information is not needlessly disclosed[,] and encouraging [v]ictim companies [to] consider sharing press releases regarding a cyber incident with investigators before issuing them to avoid releasing information that might impede the ongoing investigation). 16  NASAA would never advise a regulated entity to disregard a legitimate request from law enforcement. 17  See, e.g., Best Practices for Victim Response at 18 21. 18  In our view, this would include, but not be limited to, circumstances in which the Attorney General determines that the delay is in the interest of national security. See Proposal at 30 (Item 7). Vanessa Countryman May 9, 2022 Page 5 of 6  occurred.19 Investors should have access to this valuable information. Some companies may feel the need to change or update their cybersecurity risk management practices as a result of the required disclosures but, to the extent that this is the case, the motivation for such changes will come from market pressures, not from the SEC. As such, we believe that the proposed disclosure requirements are an appropriate exercise of the Commissions authority regarding public companies. The Proposal asks whether there are additional aspects of a companys cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed, as well as whether companies should be required to explicitly state that they have not established any such policies and procedures if that is the case.20 If a company has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures, the rule should require that the company state that explicitly. Investors should not be left to intuit the meaning of a companys silence in its disclosures. However, the company should also be required to provide an explanation for why it has not done so. This information would allow investors to fully assess the significance of the companys lack of policies and procedures and make informed investment decisions. This approach would be consistent with the Commissions recent rule proposal regarding Rule 10b5 1 and insider trading.21 In that proposal, the Commission proposed new Item 408 to Regulation S K, which would require a public company to disclose whether [it] has adopted insider trading policies and procedures [and] [i]f the registrant has not adopted such policies and procedures explain why it has not done so.22 The Commission should impose the same requirement for the Risk Management Disclosures. The Proposal asks whether the final rule should exempt certain categories of public company registrants from either category of the Risk Management Disclosures, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or foreign private issuers.23 We would oppose such a change for the reasons already stated in the Proposal: [E]vidence suggests that smaller companies may have an equal or greater risk than larger companies of being attacked, making the proposed disclosures particularly important for their investors. The financial impact from an attack could also be more detrimental for smaller companies than for larger ones. To the extent that one indirect effect of the proposed disclosure may be that companies take additional steps to address potential vulnerabilities or enhance their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, any resulting reduction in vulnerability may be particularly beneficial for smaller companies and their investors.24  19  See generally Best Practices for Victim Response at 1 12. 20  Proposal at 42 (Item 17), 43 (Item 21).  21  See Proposed Rule, Rule 10b5 1 and Insider Trading, SEC Release No. 33 11013 (Jan. 13, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11013.pdf.  22  Proposed Item 408(b)(1), SEC Release No. 33 11013 at 139. 23  Proposal at 43 (Item 23), 47 (Item 35). 24  Id. at 86.

I. Preliminary Comment and Focus in Support of the Proposed Rules  We write in overall support of the Proposed Disclosure Rules, with more detailed comments on specific aspects which could make the final rules more efficient and effective for the SEC and industry in support of the SECs objectives. Requiring more timely and consistent disclosures related to varying aspects of cybersecurity risks and risk management measures are reasonable in light of the importance of such risks to public companies generally, and the benefits to investors and te markets of more timely, consistent and comparable disclosures. In addition to the SECs goals in promoting transparency, these rules are complementary to the broader objectives of the SEC in understanding and reducing systemic risk, which have led the SEC to require, as well as propose additional rules that would require, reporting to the SEC of operations incidents resulting from cybersecurity or other causes. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 2  While cybersecurity risks are relevant to all public companies in our modern digital age, the impact of analogous incidents at distinct public companies may nonetheless differ substantially as much on the nature of the specific company, its business model, and customer base, as to the level of risk management, strategy and governance put in place ex ante to mitigate risks.  Moreover, cybersecurity incidents are one component of operational risks that could lead to disruption at public companies, as well as exposure of personal information. Taking into consideration the dependency of public companies generally on third party service providers as described in the proposed rule, the SECs goals of providing more timely and consistent material information for investors would be better served by focusing more broadly on disclosure of effects of broader operational incidents then the more limited cause of cybersecurity. Finally, the SEC should continue to attempt to harmonize incident reporting with other increasing governmental incident reporting rules. A. Relation among (i) risk mitigation policies, strategy and governance, and  (ii) incident reporting  We generally support the SEC proposing more consistent reporting of cybersecurity risk mitigation measures. We nonetheless note that in proposing greater transparency, the SEC has not proposed to prescribe specific minimum standards or steps as has been the case for regulated financial services providers in connection with a broader compliance program. In such compliance programs implementing policy objectives for the broader financial services sector, it is common to include both proactive risk mitigation measures, as well as disclosures of incidents which occur notwithstanding even reasonable risk mitigation measures. It must be emphasized, however, that disclosures with respect to risk mitigation versus those with respect to incidents are somewhat different. For current, high level purposes, we wish to focus on the different temporal nature:  Policies and procedures are proactive, ex ante measures aimed at increasing risk awareness, and where possible risk mitigation, and should be reasonably tailored to the business model and risks of the each public company. It must be noted, however, that while cybersecurity risks may be mitigated through a reasonably designed and implemented program, they cannot be totally eliminated.  Reporting of incidents is by definition ex post, and preparing a structured way for such reporting recognizes that cybersecurity risks may be mitigated but cannot be eliminated. Timely public reporting of material incidents could increase information broadly available to investors.   Unlike prompt (usually confidential) reporting from a regulated entity to the SEC or other oversight authority, the incident reporting in the Proposed Disclosure Rules are not primarily designed nor would they directly serve to allow the SEC to identify and where possible to act with respect to potential systemic risks to the financial services providers under its oversight. Prompt initial reporting of operational incidents or events may require reporting before the cause is identified, be it either due to an unauthorized occurrence and hence falling under the proposed cybersecurity incident definition, or Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 3  some other source of operational failure (e.g., other human error, coding error, hardware failure or natural cause). o The proposed incident reporting to the public under the Proposed Disclosure Rules should remain secondary to the evolving reporting requirements to public authorities increasingly applicable to many public companies, both in terms of (a) priority of the systemic goals and risk mitigation objectives of the latter reporting; and (b) additional time needed for public companies to assess impact and materiality which would be necessary to make meaningful reporting to the general public under the Proposed Disclosure Rules.  A further relation between ex ante reporting of risk mitigation policies and procedures, cybersecurity governance, etc., and ex post reporting of incidents, is that the occurrence of incidents does provide some indication of the reasonableness or effectiveness of an entitys risk mitigation measures, albeit not conclusive indication. An analogy can be made to the principles in the securities industry and related disclosures that risk taking is correlated with returns (and that additional controls or risk mitigation measures come at costs); as well as that historical return (or historical incidents) are not necessarily indicative of future returns (or incidents). This comment letter will focus most on elements relevant to the timely reporting of incidents under the Proposed Disclosure Rules. It would be prudent and consistent with the SECs goals of making more timely and consistent information to investors not only to adopt cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, but also a broader definition of operations events and incidents reporting, including involving third party service providers, than under the proposed narrow definition of cybersecurity incidents. B. Reporting disclosure of effects of operational incidents, versus more narrow disclosure requirements with respect to causes that are cybersecurity incidents  Throughout this comment letter, we note that the SECs goals of making more timely, consistent and comparable information to investors would be better served by requiring incident reporting with respect to operations disruptions. The SEC has expressed concern over timely reporting by a public company under the proposed rule language that a materiality determination be made as soon as reasonably practicable after the discovery of the [cybersecurity] incident. This is effectively a two part test of (1) identifying a cybersecurity incident; and (2) determining materiality. In practice, however, a company can be expected in many instances to more quickly be able to identify the effect of an operational disruption than to discern the cause as a cybersecurity incident of unauthorized access. This is even moreso the case when the disruption involves an information system used by the registrant but operated by a third party service provider, which in the data cited by the SEC in the rulemaking may represent a majority of the cases. The public company can much better assess the impact of a disruption of services from a service provider than it can the cause of the disruption at the service provider. The SEC has made clear in the preamble, and we fully support this, that what constitutes materiality for the Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 4  purposes of the proposed cybersecurity incidents disclosure would be consistent with existing securities law case law applicable more broadly than cybersecurity.1 Against that decades of developments of materiality for disclosure to investors, it is even more compelling that the SEC should focus on incident disclosure requirements for operational disruptions more generally, and not narrowly due to cybersecurity causes. We respectfully suggest that our comments are intended to promote the SECs goals, and where practical to focus on the most relevant effects of broader operations incidents which in turn would promote more timely, consistent and comparable information for investors. II. Summary of Conclusion and General Comments We write in overall support of the proposed rules. This comment letter will provide more detailed comments on the following aspects, which are meant to help the SEC craft rules that will more efficiently and effectively support its objectives. Requiring cybersecurity risk mitigation disclosures and incident reporting are reasonable in light of the SECs goals in promoting more timely and consistent information to investors.  Cybersecurity is one of the greatest risks facing not only public companies, but our modern economy more generally, which of course includes customers of public companies and ultimately consumers and investors. That being said, cybersecurity is (i) one component of the broader category of operational risk (i.e., as opposed to more traditional financial sector risks such as credit, market or liquidity risks); and (ii) cybersecurity risks are driven not only by growing cybersecurity threats, but by the exposure created by the increasing reliance on IT and communications, AND, (iii) increasing reliance on third party service providers including subcontractors. Taking all of the foregoing into consideration, the cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures, and cybersecurity incident reportings should: • Continue to be part of an overall operational risk management framework and resilience from disruptions leading to a similar negative effect even if not caused by a defined cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access; too narrow or prescriptive cybersecurity rules will lead to a check the box approach not consistent with the broader goals and purposes • Must take into consideration and therefore integrate practices for the public companys oversight of third party service providers o Include further expectations for understanding and due diligence of further sub contracting and further service provider dependency chains • The requirements for prompt, initial incident reporting should be expanded to apply to operations events beyond just what are initially identified as cybersecurity incidents; otherwise, the public will receive an underreporting of the desired incident information potentially material to investors, and such reporting could be further delayed by the step to evaluate the potential cause of qualification as a cybersecurity incident  1 See 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,596. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 5  • For incident reporting to be timely and effective, public companies will need to obtain, at least as contractually agreed, timely incident notifications from their service providers, including through subcontractor chains • The SEC should continue to seek harmonization with reporting of cybersecurity and operational risk incident reporting increasing mandated by the SEC and other government authorities for parties other than public companies (including for public companies due to their regulation as a financial services provider or categorization as part of critical infrastructure) o This harmonization also needs to take into consideration that many relevant third party service providers have broader support relationships than just for public companies that might be effected by these Proposed Disclosure Rules • The recommendations discussed herein have application across public companies of all sizes, and we do not believe that there are significant difference in the relevance, costs, benefits or burdens for public companies based on size that would suggest the need for differing requirements or applicable exemptions. Rather, the nature of the business and risks applicable to a specific public company will be much more relevant than its market capitalization. • Public companies, including smaller entities, can draw upon industry shared solutions and specialized service providers, both for their oversight of risks—in particular reliance on third party service providers, and in incident reporting. Shared solutions are appropriate and can be viable, effective, and efficient not only at the level of proactive risk mitigation, but throughout the risk management life cycle, and in reporting of incidents, as well as subsequent updates. • Upon adoption of amended versions of the Proposed Disclosure Rules, the SEC is respectfully requested to withdraw prior guidance which would partially be superseded by such rules, and to re issue other portions together with revised elements relevant to the new rule framework; specifically, the SEC should withdraw the 2011 Staff Guidance and 2018 Interpretative Release.2 III. About the Commenters This comment is submitted by CRINDATA, LLC, (www.CRINDATA.com) which offers solutions to financial institutions for managing operational risk in their reliance on third party service providers. Underlying a significant aspect of the SECs cybersecurity risk concerns as described in the Proposed Disclosure Rules is the structural framework under which public  2 We refer to the guidance as described at 87 Fed. Reg. 16,593. The preamble to the proposed rulemaking states:  The guidance set forth in both the 2011 Staff Guidance and the 2018 Interpretative Release would remain in place if the Commission adopts the proposed rule amendments described in this release. Id. at 16,594. It creates additional burden to the affected industry members, in this case public companies, to retain guidance that has been at least partially superseded by new rules; retaining these pieces of guidance would increase the burden upon industry and divert resources from focusing on the intended policy goals, thereby also risking undermining effectiveness. As such, a better practice as a regulatory authority would be to withdraw the outdated guidance and restate any elements which the agency wishes to retain beyond the points superseded by a rule implemented from the proposal.  Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 6  companies rely on a range of distinct service providers in order to operate, which in turn can expose the public company to cybersecurity risks (with the data cited by the SEC suggesting even possibly risks related to a majority of incidents). CRINDATA offers unique cloud based solutions to companies, with a focus on high regulated financial institutions who must pro actively manage their critical third party relationships (including their indirect relationships with subcontractors) and must prepare for and mitigate business disruption management and cybersecurity events originating anywhere in the chain of service providers and subcontractors. Concurrently, CRINDATA helps third party service providers like cloud providers, payments providers, and transaction monitoring solutions, by substantially simplifying the due diligence interactions with financial service companies and by providing a compliant, common platform and communications to manage business disruptions and cybersecurity events when they occur. The platform serves needs across multiple jurisdictions applying similar, evolving risk management principles. The authors of this comment letter are CRINDATAs co founders, Mark Stetler and James H. Freis, Jr. Mr. Freis as the primary author draws upon his experience working together with the SEC while serving as Director of the U.S. Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and in a range of other roles on behalf of government and private sector groups including SEC regulated entities, and in his previously responsibilities as Managing Director at Deutsche Börse AG, where he was responsible for material public disclosures by this blue chip company, as well as aspects of the disclosure requirements for the entities and securities trading on the exchanges operated by the Deutsche Börse Group. IV. Trend towards operational incident reporting and opportunity to promote further harmonization While cybersecurity risks are relevant to public companies, they are not in any way unique to them. Rather, the cybersecurity risks are one component of operational risks that could lead to disruption at the public companies, as well as exposure of personal information. Hence, cybersecurity reporting for public companies should be required as part of broader operational event reporting; and harmonized with other increasing governmental incident reporting rules. Operational events, including cybersecurity incidents, can have implications for investor decision making in terms of direct and indirect costs and adverse consequences including legal risks and the potential for exposure of confidential and/or personal information.3  As to relevant operational risks being broader than cybersecurity incidents, the SEC should pursue reporting incident requirements in the broader context of broader operational risk  3 We agree with the description of costs and adverse consequences mentioned at 87 Fed. Reg. 16,592.  We nonetheless note that caution should be made in lumping direct costs (e.g., a cybersecurity incident involving misappropriating assets of a public company) with more speculative negative effects such as whether an event might negatively impact a companys reputation and future business prospects. The securities markets have experience in evaluating probability and materiality, including in connection with accounting standards for impairment or valuations or requiring setting aside reserves. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 7  management efforts. Such broader reporting would be similar to the operational incident reporting that would be required under the SECs proposed rulemaking to amend Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC registered investment advisers to private funds to require current reporting upon the occurrence of key events and other requirements for advisers to certain types of funds, as published in 87 Federal Register 9106, dated February 17, 2022, for which CRINDATA filed a comment letter on March 21, 2022. While the proposed Form PF reporting would be confidential to the SEC, the instant Proposed Disclosure Rules could apply the proposed level of detail, timing, and materiality framework to the broader set of operations events at public companies rather than the more limited definition of cybersecurity incidents. Reporting of broader operational events including cybersecurity incidents also would be consistent with other SEC initiatives. Reference is made to the notification requirements under the SECs Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) which was developed, inter alia, in light of the dependency of the securities markets on evolving technology and vulnerabilities to outages including in connection with cyberattacks.4 Notably, a covered entity is required both to make an immediate notification to its Federal regulator of an incident; followed within 24 hours on a good faith, best efforts basis by a notification of event and assessment to the extent available at that time; and at later times more detailed impact assessments.5 The SEC also has published for comment a proposed rule that would to require registered investment advisers and investment companies to adopt and implement written cybersecurity policies and procedures reasonably designed to address cybersecurity risks, and to report significant cybersecurity incidents,6 for which CRINDATA also filed a public comment letter on April 11, 2022. Particularly instructive for the SEC, and essential for efforts of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor potential systemic risks, should be the new reporting requirement effective May 1, 2022 by the U.S. Federal Banking Agencies  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.7 That final rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary Federal regulator of any ‘‘computer security incident that rises to the level of a ‘‘notification incident, as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a notification incident has occurred. The final rule also requires a bank service provider to notify each affected banking organization customer as soon as possible when the bank service provider determines that it has experienced a computer security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption or degradation for four or more hours. Notably, the Federal Banking Agencies require incident reporting broader than cybersecurity incidents and more akin to the SEC policys concern underlying the proposed operations events reporting on  4 See SEC Final Rule, Systems Compliance and Integrity, 79 Fed. Reg. 72,252 (December 5, 2014), as implemented in particular in 17 CFR § 242.1002 .1007, available at 2014 27767.pdf (govinfo.gov). The primary author of this comment letter previously had oversight responsibility for the implementation of Regulation SCI by SEC regulated exchanges. 5 See 17 CFR § 242.1002(b). 6 See 87 Fed. Reg. 13,524 (March 9, 2022). 7 See 86 Fed. Reg. 66,424 (November 23, 2021).  Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 8  funds PF. This is made clear in the background explanation of the final rule of the Federal Banking Agencies, but is equally relevant to the SECs policy objectives underlying the Proposed Rules for advisers and funds: Computer security incidents can result from destructive malware or malicious software (cyberattacks), as well as non malicious failure of hardware and software, personnel errors, and other causes.8 The trend to require additional reporting of incidents or operations events will only continue.  After the SECs March 9, 2022 announcement of the Proposed Disclosure Rules, on March 15, 2022 the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.9 That appropriations law also contains the ‘‘Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 which authorizes rulemaking for incident reporting across a broad range of actors (including components of the financial sector) and calls for coordination with any analogous reporting requirements by other government agencies. Other jurisdictions are following analogous paths to mandate incident reporting. One prominent example is the European Unions proposed Digital Operations Resilience Act (DORA),10 for which a revised proposal after a round of public consultation is expected soon. This broader context should be understood as strong support for the policy goal of the SEC requiring additional reporting of relevant operations events including cybersecurity incidents, and in moving forward with additional reporting requirements without delay. That notwithstanding, the broader trend towards such reporting also emphasizes the need for the SEC to take an approach more consistent across the SECs own various new reporting proposals. The broader trend also suggests that the SEC should attempt to act increasingly consistently with other governmental authorities for which there is not a differing policy goal or interest. Many public companies that would be impacted by the Proposed Disclosure Rules are also subject to the above current or soon to be expected additional reporting requirements.  Moreover, many underlying entities impacted by the reporting requirements—in particular third party service providers—support multiple different regulated entities.  Analogous goals requiring nonetheless different prescriptive reporting methods, formats, data fields and timing would make more difficult the goals sought by the SEC and a range of other government entities to obtain and be able to share information about incidents and potential indicators of systemic risks; it would also raise the complexity and costs, and make more difficult for the regulated industry to timely notify reportable incidents. Again, a relevant consideration is that the parties involved in reportable incidents often will include broader IT service providers and sub contractors that are not limited to the Proposed Disclosure Rules at issue here for public companies; rather an operations event or incident affecting an entity such as a cloud services provider (of which the leaders are large public companies) could in the future  8 See id. at 66,425 (emphasis added). 9 Public Law No: 117 103 (March 15, 2022). 10 See Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on digital operational resilience for the financial sector and amending Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014 and (EU) No 909/2014, available at EUR Lex  52020PC0595  EN  EUR Lex (europa.eu).  Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 9  trigger directly or indirectly through affected chains of customers, reporting to a broad range of government entities. From a timing perspective, we submit that deadlines for timely reporting should follow this general order of priority, which should be maintained in relevant order even where specific time thresholds might be adopted, and this reporting should be with respect to effects of disruptions beyond limited cybersecurity causes: • Prompt reporting of third party service providers of disruptions to the companies that they support, prior to having made a detailed analysis of either cause or potential materiality • Prompt reporting of operations events by critical infrastructure or designated industry sectors to competent government authorities on a confidential basis, subject to a basic materiality standard but without detailed analysis of either cause or potential effect • Upon materiality determination, further reporting or update to government authorities as well as contractual counterpart companies who might be affected • Public company reporting based on materiality to general public for relevance in investment decisions • Reporting to individual affected consumers, such as with respect to data breach.  Part of harmonization, increased effectiveness towards the systemic risk mitigation goals of the SEC and other governmental authorities, and achieving these goals in a more efficient, effective, and less costly way for entities subject to reporting obligations would be to allow operational risk mitigation information sharing and incident reporting on behalf of these entities by specialized service providers acting on their behalf.  V. Specific Comments and Responses to Request for Comment Questions The following responds in more detail to some of the specific items on which comments were requested in connection with the proposed rules. 1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants? Yes, investors would benefit from more timely reporting about material cybersecurity incidents.  More relevant information would be provided to investors on a more timely basis, if the reporting requirement were related to operational events or disruptions rather than the more narrow definition of cybersecurity incidents, as explained throughout this comment letter. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 10  2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident that Item 1.05 should require? Additional relevant information that should be included is the extent to which the material operational disruption (caused by a cybersecurity incident or otherwise) occurred primarily at the reporting company or at a third party service provider. 4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?  As described on the preceding page, it is important that the timing first take into consideration appropriate priorities as compared to other aspects of evolving incident reporting obligations.  Provided that such prioritization can be maintained, the period of four days from a materiality determination seems reasonable for a public company to report, while still making information available to an investor much earlier than the current practice as described anecdotally in the preamble to the rule. It should be noted that a materiality determination and the preparation of a public disclosure will require input from persons of various backgrounds, likely including cybersecurity experts, legal counsel, investor relations, and business area leaders, thus requiring some time to coordinate an appropriate public disclosure. 5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold? The SEC should consider adopting in addition to the requirement of disclosing an incident material to the public company as a whole, to also require disclosure of an incident material to a segment already defined in the companys public reporting. For example, if the public company is a conglomerate with three separate business lines, each with its own profit and loss statement and running somewhat independently, and already described as such in separate segment reporting, then the company might be expected to report an operational incident that is material to a specific segment even if it could be argued that the expected impact of the incident might not be considered material for the company as a whole. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 11  6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations while providing these timely disclosures to investors? What costs would registrants face in determining the extent of a potential conflict? Adopting a priority of reporting as described two pages preceding would help reduce potential conflicts for different reporting obligations. 8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt? The proposed rule language is that a materiality determination be made as soon as reasonably practicable after the discovery of the [cybersecurity] incident. This is effectively a two part test of (1) identifying a cybersecurity incident; and (2) determining materiality. In practice, however, a company can be expected in many instances to more quickly be able to identify the effect of an operational disruption than to discern the cause as a cybersecurity incident of unauthorized access. This is even moreso the case when the disruption involves an information system used by the registrant but operated by a third party service provider, which in the data cited by the SEC in the rulemaking may represent a majority of the cases. The public company can much better assess the impact of a disruption of services from a service provider than it can the cause of the disruption at the service provider. The SEC has made clear in the preamble, and we fully support this, that what constitutes materiality for the purposes of the proposed cybersecurity incidents disclosure would be consistent with existing securities law case law applicable more broadly than cybersecurity.11 Against that decades of developments of materiality for disclosure to investors, it is even more compelling that the SEC should focus on incident disclosure requirements for operational disruptions more generally, and not narrowly due to cybersecurity causes. Yes, it would be useful is the SEC were to suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not) be considered prompt. 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe  11 See 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,596. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 12  harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? One of the greatest challenges for public companies, or any company relying on third party services providers including a potential further chain of subcontractors, is to receive timely information about incidents involving such service provider or subcontractors. That being said, the standard for reporting by the public company should be a material effect on the public company, regardless of the cause. Thus, the SEC should be clear that the definition of information systems is meant to recognize that some such systems may rely on external service providers, but the materiality is nonetheless with respect to the effect on the public company.  The public company can in most aspects determine such materiality even where the initial impact is with a service provider. There may be notable exceptions to this ability to determine, such as if personal data were breached at a service provider without a noticeable operational impact on the public company. The only way to reconcile such cases is for SEC to have an expectation that the public company will oversee its external service providers engaged in material services (those relevant to potential material risks) and include at least a contractual requirement of notification from the service provider to the public company of a potentially material incident at the service provider or a subcontractor (which in turn requires notification of incidents from the subcontractor to the service provider). As described throughout this comment letter, requiring public companies to describe material disruptions from operational incidents of a broader nature, rather than more limited to a cybersecurity cause, would be an alternative disclosure requirement better benefitting investors. Any public company should have a risk assessment as to its operational dependencies upon service providers. Such risk assessment should also take into consideration whether the third party has critical dependencies on underlying sub contractors or other service providers, in which case such underlying parties should also be included in the risk assessment. No, a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant would not be appropriate? Particularly in light of the limited evidence cited by the SEC that perhaps a majority of cybersecurity incidents derive from service provider relationships, such a safe harbor would vitiate the purposes of the rule. Rather, the materiality assessment already accounts for the information asymmetry in that the public company can only assess materiality after it becomes aware of incident, and only thereafter would reporting obligations apply. For the benefit of investors, public companies should be expected to adopt reasonable measures to obtain more timely information from their most critical service providers. There is amply experience in this regard from the regulated financial services industry, including in connection with the evolving service provider oversight and incident reporting requirements referenced, supra, at pages 7 to 8 of this comment letter. Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 13  12. We note above a non exclusive list of examples that would merit disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K covers some, but not all, types of material cybersecurity incidents. Are there additional examples we should address? Should we include a non exclusive list of examples in Item 1.05 of Form 8 K? Yes, a non exclusive list of examples should be included in Form 8 K. This would promote uniformity and the ability of investors to compare different public companies, as well as to better analyze various incidents which may occur over time. 15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K in the registrants quarterly or annual report, as proposed? Are there instances, other than to correct inaccurate or materially misleading prior disclosures, when a registrant should be required to update its report on Form 8 K or file another Form 8 K instead of providing disclosure of material changes, additions, or updates in a subsequent Form 10 Q or Form 10 K? Yes, updates of material information should be disclosed to avoid information being misleading.  This is particularly the case about a negative developments  it will commonly be the case that early reporting with not be able reasonably to determine the potential negative costs or adverse consequences of an incident. Other aspects of the type of disclosure to be provided, for example from the non exclusive list any changes in the registrants policies and procedures as a result of the cybersecurity incident…12 should not be expected to require amended disclosures, but rather could be provided in the next quarterly reporting. 17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? The preamble to the proposed rulemaking states: Given that a significant number of cybersecurity incidents pertain to third party service providers, the proposed rules would require disclosure concerning a registrants selection and oversight of third party entities as well.13 The language with respect to third party service provider oversight is too narrow, in that it is limited to cybersecurity aspects. More appropriately, cybersecurity risk is only one component of an operational risk review of relying on a third party service provider. Additionally, one of the most important provisions for effective risk assessment and oversight of service providers for operational risk management (including, but not limited to cybersecurity risks), is for the adviser or fund to have transparency with respect to material dependencies of the service provider on further subcontractors or other service providers to the service providers (also sometimes referred referred to as fourth parties). Because, by definition, there is no contractual privity between the adviser or fund and a fourth party, there is a reliance on the  12 See 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,598, bottom of right column. 13 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,599 (footnote omitted). Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 14  third party to oversee and provide information with respect to the fourth party, including changes to the use of different material fourth parties.  As related to incident reporting, if a significant incident impacts a fourth party, there must be not only contractual agreements in place, but also structured reporting mechanisms, to allow the reporting of relevant incident information: from the fourth party (or further chain of subcontractors up the chain) to the third party from the third party to the adviser or fund from the regulated adviser or fund to the SEC as regulator, as well as any other applicable authority. Understanding and assessing risks, and getting notification of incidents in timely fashion, from fourth parties or other third party service provider chains are among the greatest challenges faced for public companies. A shared solution or type of utility serving multiple companies lends itself well to sharing costs and more efficiently leveraging risk management solutions. CRINDATA is a provider of one such shared solution. It is suggested that the SEC not be prescriptive, but rather raise awareness such as in guidance on best practices about the importance of understanding exposure and addressing information needs on third party providers and their subcontractors or fourth parties. Analogous approaches have been expected for years by the Federal Banking Agencies, and revisions to guidance on oversight of outsourcing to third parties have recently been published for public consultation.14 18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? While the definitions of cybersecurity threat and related terms appear largely sufficient for the purpose of the proposal to adopt cybersecurity policies and procedures, the term cybersecurity incident is too narrow for the incident reporting requirement. Rather, the SEC should introduce a broader definition of reportable operations events or incidents including cybersecurity related incidents. The proposed definition of cybersecurity incident is: Cybersecurity incident means an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. Thus, a reportable incident would be one that involves an unauthorized occurrence. In practice, many unauthorized occurrences such as malware or trojans may go undetected for some time after being introduced, or, it may take time for the source of a disruption event to be detected and identified as to whether it was caused by an unauthorized occurrence. Various other aspects of the definitions and the preamble to the Proposed Rules make clear that the  14 See Proposed Interagency Guidance as published in 86 Federal Register 38,183 (July 19, 2021). Comments of CRINDATA Proposed Cybersecurity Disclosures S7 09 22 15  purpose of the proposed incident reporting should not be limited to the cybersecurity cause, but rather that the concerns are with respect to the effects an incident could have on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Thus, the SEC, should wish reporting to include disruptions which appear likely to affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability. It is suggested that the SEC adopt for the purposes of a new incident reporting requirement a definition of a reportable Operations Event that would be the same as that which it adopts in connection with its pending proposal, mentioned above, for reporting by private funds: that the registrant experiences a significant disruption or degradation of the reporting entitys key operations, whether as a result of an event at a service provider or the public company. In conclusion, whatever the final definition of a reportable incident, it is in the interest of the SEC and its goals of promoting the availability of more timely and consistent information to investor about material risks to have more operations incidents reported, rather than risking more narrow reporting based on whether the reporting entity has timely identified a more narrow causation involving an unauthorized occurrence. 24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or asset backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? No. The recommendations discussed herein have application across public companies of all sizes, and we do not believe that there are significant difference in the relevance, costs, benefits or burdens for public companies based on size that would suggest the need for differing requirements or applicable exemptions. Rather, the nature of the business and risks applicable to a specific public company will be much more relevant than its market capitalization. 50. Are there any other alternative approaches to improve disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity risk management, strategy, or governance that we should consider? If so, what are they and what would be the associated costs or benefits of these alternative approaches? With respect to incident disclosures, as discussed throughout this comment letter, a better alternative to more narrow reporting based on a determined cybersecurity cause would be to require reporting of material disruptions to a public company arising from a broader range of operational events or incidents. Such broader disclosure would come without much additional costs, would potentially be more timely, and would provide more material information to investors and this be of great benefit to investors.

Kaplan, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128351-291117.pdf,"2 potential consequences of cybersecurity incidents is material1; and (iii) investors are certainly on notice as to any particular registrants cybersecurity risks through extant risk factor disclosure practice. To the extent that existing deficiencies in periodic cybersecurity incidents is a motivating factor underlying proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K, we suggest that any such inadequacies could be effectively addressed by more comprehensive disclosure requirements applicable to periodic, rather than current, reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  We also respectfully submit that as a general matter Item 1.05 of Form 8 K imposes potentially undue burdens on registrants that weigh against requiring current disclosure on Form 8 K given the myriad challenges tied to identifying, understanding and managing a cybersecurity incident. In the aftermath of discovery of a cybersecurity incident: (i) a registrants information gathering may be hampered in the midst of, or by, the incident; (ii) information about the incident available to the registrant may be incomplete or inconclusive; and (iii) a registrants internal management and compliance resources may be under significant strain. Further, the fact that proposed Item 1.05 is qualitatively different from the other Items requiring disclosure under Form 8 K also argues against adopting proposed Item 1.05 (i.e., the Items required to be disclosed under current Form 8 K generally: (i) relate to events within a registrants control; (ii) events with respect to which a registrant has some advance warning or awareness; and/or (iii) events that are influenced by a registrants volitional acts; whereas proposed Item 1.05 would require disclosure of an event that is at its core a matter of registrant reactivity.  4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?  See response to Request for Comment 8 below. 7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security? Should the Commission adopt Item 1.05 of Form 8 K as proposed, we recommend that registrants be permitted to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident that is the subject of a bona fide investigation by law enforcement. As proposed, Item 1.05 does not provide for a reporting delay (beyond the standard four business day filing requirement) when there is an ongoing internal or external investigation related to a cybersecurity incident. In the relevant discussion in the Release, the Commission recognizes that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents. We respectfully suggest that the Commission should 1 Various studies and reports cited by the Commission in the Release support this conclusion (See the Release at footnote 19). 3 consider whether appropriate consideration has been given as to the necessity to delay such disclosure in the context of an ongoing investigation (particularly by law enforcement). A delay in reporting may not only facilitate such an investigation, it may be critical to its success. We are concerned that requiring Item 1.05 disclosure to be filed within the standard four business day Form 8 K filing requirement without exception will more likely alert cybercriminals to detection of their infiltration, which could enable them to abscond prior to apprehension or before the relevant methods of infiltration and exfiltration used by the criminals have been analyzed and mapped. This would have the effect of depriving the commercial sector and law enforcement agencies alike of the knowledge base necessary to more effectively address ongoing and future cybersecurity incidents. Further, to the extent that a registrant receives an official request from a law enforcement agency or body, the inability to honor such a request would put the registrant in an awkward opposite position with such agency or body and potentially and irrevocably harm the relevant investigation.2 Finally, we are concerned that the Release includes little discussion or seems to reflect inadequate consideration of the national security implications of current (and potentially premature) disclosure of a cybersecurity incident under proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. A failure to apprehend cybercriminals and fully analyze the relevant methods of infiltration and exfiltration deprives the national security firmament of tools necessary to address constantly evolving cybersecurity threats. In particular, we note that these potential harms to national security from a premature disclosure are at their most severe in the context of a cybersecurity incident at a registrant with government contracts or with a business that is focused on national security matters. We believe that modestly amending the proposed cybersecurity disclosure requirements such that registrants are sufficiently able to manage a cybersecurity incident out of the public eye is of nationally significant import.  As noted above, assuming that Form 8 K is amended to include Item 1.05 as proposed, we recommend that the Commission include an exception from the current reporting requirement under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K when a cybersecurity incident is the subject of a bona fide investigation by law enforcement. Any such delayed disclosure should, of course, be required to be made under cover of Form 8 K (or a proximate periodic report if appropriate) as soon as is reasonably practicable. We also believe that an analogous exception should be adopted such that a registrant is not required to make premature disclosure of a bona fide internal investigation under cover of Forms 10 Q or 10 K (Periodic Reports). As a means to ensure that registrants utilize such an exemption appropriately, we suggest that the Commission could require a registrant delaying disclosure of a cybersecurity incident in a Form 8 K or in a Periodic Report to include the following disclosure in the current or periodic report in which the disclosure is ultimately filed: (i) confirmation of the fact that the incident was the subject of an investigation; and (ii) the basis for utilizing the filing delay. 2 In this regard, we believe that the Commissions suggestion to narrow such an exception to requests by the Attorney General for such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security would materially diminish the utility of such an exception give the potentially short Form 8 K filing deadline. Instead, should the Commission adopt an exception that is narrower than what we have recommended above, we suggest that: (i) senior officials of other offices/agencies/departments of the U.S. government (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI) be included within the universe of persons who may make such a request and (ii) less senior (but sufficiently credentialed) officials at each such office/agency/department (e.g., an Assistant Attorney General or, in the case of the FBI, an Executive Assistant Director) be authorized to make such a request. 4 8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt? We respectfully submit that, should proposed Item 1.05 be adopted as is, the ambiguity inherent in Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 will make it difficult for a registrant to determine whether it is compliant with its current reporting obligations under Form 8 K. We are also concerned that providing examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt will provide investors with a false sense of certainty as to the completeness of the disclosure in the context of highly variable, fluid and uncertain events.  Instead, as noted above, we respectfully suggest that Form 8 K not be amended to include proposed Item 1.05. To the extent that the Commission adopts Item 1.05 to Form 8 K as proposed, we recommend that the Commission make the following modifications: (i) revise the filing trigger for Item 1.05 Form 8 K such that a disclosure is required following a determination by the registrant that it has experienced a material cybersecurity event; but only to the extent that the information upon which the determination is based has been deemed by the registrant to be (a) verified by the registrant as accurate with a high degree of confidence and (b) unlikely to materially change; and (ii) lengthen the filing requirement by at least one business day within which an Item 1.05 Form 8 K is required to be filed (i.e., the Form would be required to be filed within 5 business days of the registrants determination). We believe that these two changes would increase certainty in a registrants disclosure and appropriately balance the Commissions objectives of timely disclosure against the burdens on a registrant in the context of a cybersecurity incident. 13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 for failure to timely file a Form 8 K, as proposed? See response to Request for Comment 14 below. 14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3? We believe that the proposed amendments to Form S 3 and F 3 and to the Exchange Act safe harbor provisions noted above are appropriate and warranted. Given the uncertainties inherent in and the burdens related to the production of disclosures relating to cybersecurity incidents (particularly at or shortly following discovery), noted above, we agree with the Commission that: (i) a loss of Form S 3 or F 3 eligibility due to a failure to timely file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K would be unduly harsh; and (ii) inclusion of Item 1.05 in the list of Form 8 K items eligible for the safe harbor is warranted. We also believe that the inclusion of Item 1.05 Form 8 K(s) as per items (i) and (ii) above would further the Commissions goal of facilitating 5 the provision of more timely and consistent disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents across registrants. 18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? We note that the definition of cybersecurity threat as proposed means: any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein (emphasis added). We respectfully suggest that the use of a may standard establishes an unhelpfully low standard that would require registrants to establish policies and procedures that are potentially overbroad and not appropriately tailored to those threats that are reasonably foreseeable. As such, we recommend that the definition of cybersecurity threat be revised by replacing may with could reasonably be expected to. 38. Should we amend Form 20 F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form 6 K, as proposed, to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic? Are there unique considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts? We respectfully suggest to the Commission that the disclosure of a cybersecurity incident by a foreign private issuer presents the same issues and considerations as those noted in our responses above. As such, we believe that it would be appropriate to amend the filing and disclosure requirements set forth in the Release in sync with the amendments we recommend above for domestic issuers. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to submit for the Commissions consideration our comments on the Release as set forth herein.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  RE: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incidence Disclosure Proposed Rule (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators) is pleased to submit comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) on its proposed rule entitled, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incidence Disclosure. Auto Innovators welcomes the opportunity to share the automotive industrys perspectives on the Commissions proposals to require reporting about material cybersecurity incidents; mandate updates about previously reported cybersecurity incidents; and provide periodic disclosures about cybersecurity policies and procedures, their implementation by management, the cybersecurity expertise of Boards of Directors, and Board oversight of cybersecurity risk. Auto Innovators is the singular, authoritative, and respected voice of the automotive industry. Focused on creating a safe and transformative path for personal mobility, Auto Innovators represents the manufacturers that produce nearly 98 percent of cars and light trucks sold in the United States, original equipment suppliers, technology companies, and other value chain partners within the automotive ecosystem. The automotive industry is the nations largest manufacturing sector, representing 5.5 percent of the countrys GDP and responsible for roughly 10 million jobs.  Automotive companies operate across multiple domains when it comes to cybersecurity, including cybersecurity engineering and product security, operational technology and cyber physical systems, and information technology. Managing evolving cybersecurity risks, adopting cybersecurity best practices, and engaging in cross sectoral and public private partnerships are critical to securing the entirety of the automotive ecosystem. Auto Innovators and its member companies understand the importance of remaining nimble in responding to a dynamic cybersecurity threat environment, particularly as connectivity, electrification, and automation results in the integration of vehicles into a broader ecosystem of connected infrastructure, devices, features, and stakeholders.  While the proposed rule intends to better inform investors about a registrants risk management, strategy, and governance and to provide timely notification of material cybersecurity incidents, the disclosures required under the proposed rule may actually undermine the cybersecurity posture of registrants and their ability to respond to, and recover from, cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, we have the following concerns with the proposed rule:  • Requiring Registrants to Publicly Report on Ongoing Cybersecurity Incidents: Having to publicly report on an ongoing cybersecurity incident detracts from a firms ability to fully remediate by directing resources to the reporting requirement, while also potentially alerting additional bad actors that a firm may be vulnerable. The proposed rule may also have the inadvertent consequence of creating more onerous reporting for firms that invest in strong cybersecurity risk management programs which are more robust and detect more minor threats. Furthermore, the inability to delay reporting due to an external investigation involving law enforcement could negate national security interests and is inconsistent with other cybersecurity incident reporting notification requirements.1 A foundational underlying principle of the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 20222 is the protection and confidentiality of shared incident information.  • Mandating Reporting within Four Business Days After Materiality Determination: While the proposed rule requires a registrant to disclose an incident four business days after it has determined that it has experienced a material event, the SEC states that it expects management to make a materiality determination about the incident as reasonably practicable after its discovery of the incident.3 In the immediate aftermath of discovering a cybersecurity incident, a firm is often working with incomplete information about its scope, affected systems and / or data, potential actor(s) responsible, etc. Making a materiality determination quickly may detract from core incident response and remediation activity, particularly because the proposed rules examples of cybersecurity incidents that may trigger disclosure are so broad. This is layered on top of potential risks and harms to investors that may result when businesses act too quickly to assess the materiality of an event as information rapidly develops and may initially be incomplete. Furthermore, having only four business days to disclose will likely result in multiple incomplete (and potentially inaccurate) disclosures, creating significant administrative burden and cost for registrants, and contributing to confusion for investors and shareholders.  • Providing Disclosures on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance: The proposed rule would require registrants to periodically disclose their policies and procedures regarding their cybersecurity risk management and strategy, but such information provides little benefit to investors and shareholders without also knowing a firms system architecture and data practices. Obviously, this level of granularity could provide a bad actor with information to perpetrate a potential cyber attack. Disclosing whether a registrants Board of Directors has specific cybersecurity expertise also has little bearing on the overall cybersecurity posture of a firm, especially when a firm may have other personnel, such as a Chief Information Security Officer or CISO, who directs day to day cybersecurity risk management operations.  1 For example, state data breach notification laws require firms to report in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement…or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. See California Civil Code § 1798.82(a) as an example. 2 See Division Y of Public Law 117 103. 3 See 87 FR 16596.  Auto Innovators recommends that the SEC consider certain principles from existing cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, including the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022. These include:  • Protecting sensitive incident information from unnecessary premature disclosure that can further enable malicious cyber threat actors • Harmonizing cybersecurity incident reporting requirements across the federal government • Prohibiting the use of incident reporting information for enforcement purposes or regulatory actions  • Incorporating confidentiality, liability, legal privilege, and trade secrets protections for incident reporting information • Exempting reporting requirements when law enforcement investigations are ongoing  Auto Innovators appreciates being able to weigh in on the SECs proposed rule. We look forward to continued engagement with the Commission as it considers how to better inform investors about registrants cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance approaches, while also ensuring that firms can maintain strong cybersecurity postures.

We support the Commissions efforts to improve the timeliness and nature of disclosures made about material cybersecurity incidents and registrants undertakings to manage and mitigate material cybersecurity risks. The prevalence of significant cybersecurity incidents, as well as the increasing and often substantial costs associated with such incidents highlight the need for companies to communicate timely and accurate information related to these events to their investors. We believe investors are best suited to provide feedback about the utility of the proposed disclosures and that registrants are best suited to provide feedback about the operational feasibility of providing the proposed disclosures in the specified timeframes. However, we have several observations about the clarity and application of the rules that the Commission may wish to consider when drafting the final amendments.   Proposed Disclosures in Form 10 K  We generally support the proposed approach to include the required cybersecurity disclosures in a separately captioned section of Form 10 K. However, we note that proposed Item 1.C., would require registrants to furnish all information required by proposed Item 106 of Regulation S K, which includes cyber risk management and strategy (106(b)), governance (Item 106(c)), and updated incident disclosure (Item 106(d)). We believe the requirement to disclose the boards oversight of cybersecurity risks under Item 106(c)(1) would be better placed within Part III, Item 10 of Form 10 K where the registrant makes its other disclosures about corporate governance matters. Registrants often incorporate Part III information of Form 10 K by reference from their proxy statements that are filed at a later date. We wondered whether the Commission intended cybersecurity governance disclosures to precede disclosure of all governance matters related to a registrant. Accordingly, we recommend moving the proposed Item 106(c)(1) disclosure requirements into Item 407, Corporate Governance, of Regulation S K to better align the disclosures with the framework for disclosure on other governance matters. IBDQ  2  Separately, we note proposed Item 106(d) of Regulation S K would require companies to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become material in the aggregate. However, the timeframe over which these incidents need to be evaluated to trigger such a disclosure is not clear. Should registrants evaluate the requirement based on the period presented in the periodic report (e.g., the latest fiscal year or interim period)?  Do they need to consider aggregation over all periods included in the periodic report? Absent clarifying guidance, some may interpret the timeframe to be open ended (such that registrants would need to track and perpetually aggregate the impact of incidents that span fiscal periods, an outcome which we believe is unlikely to produce meaningful disclosure about material cyber incidents). We also have questions about how to interpret the intended breadth of the disclosure requirement. While the proposing release acknowledges that incidents can take a variety of forms, the example is that of one malicious actor who engages in numerous small but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company, which may need to be disclosed if the incidents were material in the aggregate. Is the intent of the requirement to address these repeated attempts and attacks from the same party or multiple parties? How should registrants think about whether the incidents represent a series of previously undisclosed incidents? If the incidents relate to different systems at different times by different malicious actors (or any variation thereof that is not continuous attack by one malicious actor on the same system), are those to be flagged for potential aggregation? Registrants may face significant challenges making such a requirement operational. In light of these questions and to promote clarity for preparers, we encourage the SEC to address the timeframe and breadth of this disclosure requirement.   Board Cybersecurity Expertise  Proposed Item 407(j) of Regulation S K would require a registrant to disclose if any member of the board of directors has expertise in cybersecurity, including the names of such directors and any details necessary to describe the nature of their expertise. While we recognize the importance of cybersecurity expertise at the board level, we note that boards fulfill the need for ‘expertise in different ways depending on registrant specific facts and circumstances. For some companies, a board member with requisite cybersecurity expertise may be warranted. For others, while board members understand the registrants material cybersecurity risks, policies, and incidents, they may supplement their knowledge needs with the use of outside advisors and experts in lieu of having board member ‘expertise. We support the ability of companies, their boards, and shareholders to consider what level of expertise is most beneficial to the organization and how that need will be satisfied (whether internal or supplemental external support for the wide array of topics a board must address). We wonder whether the requirement to explicitly disclose board level cybersecurity expertise may cause companies to seek out members with cybersecurity expertise, even if the board or registrant would benefit more from expertise in other areas. We suspect this will be a challenging exercise, particularly for smaller companies when the pool of board candidates with this type of expertise may be limited. Smaller boards (e.g., of five individuals) may face similar challenges.  Consequently, we believe the SEC should consider whether the existing disclosure requirements of IBDQ  3  Item 401 of Regulation S K1 about board expertise are sufficient without placing undue emphasis on cybersecurity above other material risks and business needs. Phased Compliance  The proposing release notes that the cost of the proposed amendments for smaller companies might be disproportionately high compared to larger companies but the costs of an attack could be more detrimental. While the benefits of the proposed disclosures may outweigh the costs associated with making them, the Commission may consider a longer transition period for smaller reporting companies.  We believe that there may be an opportunity to mitigate some of the disproportionate cost by allowing them to benefit from any implementation lessons and disclosures made by larger companies. This transition period would also allow these companies more time to organically develop or outwardly obtain the necessary expertise to comply with the proposed requirements.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * We appreciate this opportunity to express our views to the Commission.

79,"Rod Miller, Chair, Securities Regulation Committee Association of the Bar of the City of New York",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128425-291354.pdf,"2 Substantive Recommendations The Committee has certain concerns regarding the substantive aspects of the Proposal, which are set forth below, along with certain recommendations of the Committee for addressing such concerns.  Requirement to File an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. The Committee respectfully submits that as Proposed, Item 1.05 of Form 8 K imposes potentially undue burdens on registrants at a time (i.e., in the aftermath of discovery of a cybersecurity incident) when: (i) a registrants information gathering may be negatively affected by the incident itself; (ii) information about the incident available to the registrant may be incomplete or inconclusive; and (iii) a registrants internal management and compliance resources may be under significant strain. Further, the Items required to be disclosed under current Form 8 K generally: (i) relate to events within a registrants control; (ii) events with respect to which a registrant has some advance warning or awareness and/or (iii) events that are influenced by a registrants volitional acts. As such, Proposed Item 1.05 is qualitatively different from the other Items requiring disclosure under Form 8 K, and given the myriad challenges tied to identifying, understanding and managing a cybersecurity incident, the Committee believes that augmented cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements are more appropriately applicable to a registrants Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q and Annual Report on Form 10 K. This is particularly true in the Committees view given the fact that: (i) cybersecurity is a pervasive threat affecting all registrants; (ii) the pervasive nature of this threat and the potential consequences of a cybersecurity incident are well known to the investing public (one need only walk through an airport and take in the advertisements for cybersecurity firms to know how mainstream these issues have become); and (iii) investors are certainly on notice as to a registrants cybersecurity risks through extant risk factor disclosure practice. The Committee acknowledges the Commissions concern that disclosure practices in this regard vary widely; however, it is the Committees view that any inadequacies in this regard could be effectively addressed by more comprehensive disclosure requirements applicable to quarterly or annual, rather than current, reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). For the foregoing reasons, the Committee respectfully submits that Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K places a potentially undue burden on a registrant experiencing a cybersecurity incident, and the Commission should not amend Form 8 K to include Proposed Item 1.05. The Committee also respectfully submits that the ambiguity inherent in Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 will make it difficult for a registrant to determine whether it is compliant with its reporting obligations under Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. The Committee is also concerned that providing examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt will provide a false sense of certainty in the context of highly variable, fluid and uncertain events. Instead, as noted above, the Committee respectfully suggests that Form 8 K not be amended to include Proposed Item 1.05. To the extent that the Commission adopts Item 1.05 to Form 8 K as proposed, the Committee suggests the following modifications: (i) the requirement to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K be based not only on the determination by the registrant that it has experienced a material cybersecurity event, but that the filing be required only to the extent that the 3 information upon which the determination is based has been deemed by the registrant to be (a) verified as accurate with a high degree of confidence and (b) unlikely to materially change and (ii) the filing period within which an Item 1.05 Form 8 K is required to be filed be lengthened by at least one business day (i.e., the Form would be required to be filed within 5 business days or more of the registrants determination). The Committee believes that these two changes would increase certainty in a registrants disclosure and more appropriately balance the Commissions objectives of timely disclosure against the burdens on a registrant in the context of a cybersecurity incident. Proposed Inline XBRL Tagging Requirement. The Committee is also concerned regarding the Proposed Inline XBRL tagging requirement, and specifically, that given the time sensitive nature of the disclosures being made, such Proposed requirement unduly adds to the burden of companies already dealing with a multi pronged response to a material incident. Accordingly, the Committee respectfully proposes that, to the extent the Proposal is adopted, that the Proposed Inline XBRL tagging requirement not be included. Proposed Amendments to the Eligibility Provisions of Form S 3 and Form SF 3 and Safe Harbor Provisions in Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11. As noted by the Commission, the purpose of the Proposals is to provide more timely and consistent disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents. The benefits of providing this information should be weighed in the context of the uncertainties inherent in and the burdens related to the production of disclosures relating to cybersecurity incidents (particularly at or shortly following discovery).  As such, should the Commission amend Form 8 K to include Proposed Item 1.05, the Committee believes that the Proposed Amendments to Form S 3 and F 3 and to the Exchange Act safe harbor provisions noted above is appropriate and warranted.  Exception for Cybersecurity Incidents Under Investigation. The Proposal would require a registrant to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident.  The Proposal does not provide for a reporting delay when there is an ongoing internal or external investigation related to the cybersecurity incident. In the relevant discussion on point, the Commission recognizes that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents. The Committee respectfully suggests that the Commission has not given appropriate weight to the necessity to delay such disclosure in the context of an ongoing investigation (particularly by law enforcement). A delay in reporting may not only facilitate such an investigation, it may be critical to its success. The Committee is concerned that requiring such current disclosure without exception will more likely alert cybercriminals to detection of their infiltration, which could enable them to abscond prior to apprehension or before the relevant methods of infiltration and exfiltration used by the criminals have been analyzed and mapped. This would have the effect of depriving the commercial sector and law enforcement agencies alike of the knowledge base necessary to more effectively address ongoing and future cybersecurity incidents.  Further, it is a fact that law enforcement agencies have in the past and may in the future request that a registrant that has experienced a cybersecurity incident keep the fact of the incident confidential for a specified period of time. Without an exception to Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K, a registrant could find itself having to deny such a law enforcement request. Finally, the Committee is concerned that the Proposal includes little discussion or seems to reflect inadequate consideration of the national security implications of current (and potentially premature) disclosure of a 4 cybersecurity incident under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K as Proposed. A failure to apprehend cybercriminals and fully analyze the relevant methods of infiltration and exfiltration deprives the national security firmament of tools necessary to address constantly evolving cybersecurity threats. The Committee notes that these potential harms to national security from a premature disclosure are at their most severe in the context of a cybersecurity incident at a registrant with government contracts or with a business that is focused on national security matters. The Committee believes that ensuring that these types of registrants are sufficiently able to manage a cybersecurity incident out of the public eye is of significant import.  To address the Committees concern in this regard and assuming that Form 8 K is amended as Proposed, the Committee recommends the Commission include an exception from the current reporting requirement under Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K when a cybersecurity incident is the subject of a bona fide internal investigation or investigation by law enforcement. Any such delayed disclosure should, of course, be required to be made under cover of Form 8 K (or a proximate periodic report if appropriate) as soon as is reasonably practicable. Further, as a means to ensure that registrants utilize such an exemption appropriately, the Commission could require a registrant delaying Form 8 K disclosure of a cybersecurity incident to include the following disclosure in the Item 1.05 Form 8 K disclosure ultimately filed (or, if such disclosure is instead included in a periodic report, that report): (i) confirmation of the fact that the incident was the subject of an investigation and (ii) the basis for utilizing the filing delay. Definition of Cybersecurity threat. The definition of Cybersecurity threat as Proposed means: any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. (emphasis added). The Committee respectfully submits that the use of a may standard establishes a standard that would require registrants to establish policies and procedures that are potentially overbroad and not appropriately tailored to those threats that are reasonably foreseeable. As such, the Committee suggests that the definition of Cybersecurity threat be revised by replacing may with could reasonably be expected to. * * * We thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important Commission initiative.

The proposed rule acknowledges it could potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants and the risk of future attacks.2 Despite recognition of this and other concerns, the proposed rule deems the potential value of public cyber incident disclosures as outweighing the security risks. This risk contradicts Congresss legislative intent with the enactment of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, a bill I co authored. That law seeks to enhance the visibility of the United States Government into cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. Through increased information sharing, the Government will be better positioned to coordinate its response to cyberattacks and warn potential victims. At the same time, the law has appropriate liability, privacy, and use protections for the information reported to the Government, in part to ensure that victims are not made more vulnerable by their disclosures to the Government. This letter discusses the issues surrounding the proposed rules lack of an exception for an ongoing law enforcement investigation, public disclosure of ongoing cyber incidents, and public disclosure of company cybersecurity plans and procedures. It also documents Congresss intent that the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act be the primary 1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure 63 (Mar. 9, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 2 Id. at 62. 2 mechanism for companies to report cyber incidents. The SEC should work closely with the National Cyber Director, the Department of Homeland Security, and industry stakeholders to deconflict existing reporting requirements and ensure the proposed rule does not require companies to disclose information that would put their security at risk.  LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION EXEMPTION The SECs proposed rule does not allow companies to delay disclosure because of ongoing law enforcement investigations or related Governmental actions. The proposed rule correctly notes that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents.3 Premature public disclosure can also hinder a variety of important Government functions including deterrence and recovery actions, attribution, broader remediation, and sharing of threat and vulnerability information with other potential targets. Nevertheless, the SEC maintains that the importance of timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents for investors would justify not providing a reporting delay.4 I disagree. The SECs proposal not to provide a reporting delay conflicts with state breach notification laws, which do provide for delayed reporting in the case of an ongoing law enforcement investigation.5 The proposed rule expressly acknowledges this saying, there is a possibility a registrant would be required to disclose [an] incident on Form 8 K even though it could delay incident reporting under a particular state law.6 Even the SEC itself is entitled to delay reporting a breach of its own systems to affected individuals when necessary to avoid impairing law enforcement or other Governmental actions. Under OMB guidance, the SEC may delay notification to individuals potentially impacted by a breach if the Attorney General, head of an element of the Intelligence Community, or the Secretary of Homeland Security determines the notification would disrupt a law enforcement investigation, endanger national security, or hamper security remediation actions.7 In effect, the proposed rule prioritizes prompt public disclosure of information regarding material cybersecurity incidents over law enforcement and national security risks. In enacting the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, Congress concluded the opposite. The law makes congressional intent clear—incident reporting requirements should not impair law enforcement investigations and other important security related work. For example, while communication[s], document[s], material[s], or other record[s], created for the sole purpose of preparing, drafting, or submitting an incident report 3 Id. at 25. 4 Id.  5 Id.; see also, e.g., Security Breach Notification Laws, NAT.

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, M 17 12, PREPARING FOR AND RESPONDING TO A BREACH OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 31 (2017). 3 cannot be received in evidence, law enforcement can use the reported information to investigate cyber incidents.8  When considering the legislation, Congress noted if the FBI is provided information from reports under the process outlined in the statute, [it] may, as appropriate, use information contained in the reports and derived from them for a range of investigatory activities.9 This is consistent with the statute which states incident reports can be used for the purpose preventing, investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting an offense arising out of a cyber incident reported under the law.10 This allows law enforcement agencies to disrupt and deter hostile cyber actors, while maintaining the laws goal of encouraging entities to disclose cyber incidents to the Federal Government.11  In a dissenting statement on the proposed SEC rule, Commissioner Hester Peirce expressed similar concerns regarding law enforcement investigations. Ms. Peirce said her primary concern with the proposed incident reporting requirements is that we are unduly dismissive of the need to cooperate with, and sometimes defer to, our partners across the Federal Government and state government.12 On law enforcement investigation exemptions specifically, she correctly noted if such a delay would increase the likelihood of holding cybercriminals accountable, then the SEC should consider whether temporary relief from our disclosure requirements would best protect investors.13 Such an exemption would be consistent not only with existing state breach notification laws, but also Congresss intent, reflected in the recent enactment of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. ONGOING CYBER INCIDENT DISCLOSURE The proposed rule also requires companies to disclose ongoing cyber incidents. In particular, the rule would not provide for a reporting delay when there is an ongoing internal . . . investigation related to the cybersecurity incident.14 The rule justifies this saying, while an ongoing investigation might affect the specifics in the registrants disclosure, ‘an ongoing internal investigation or external investigation—which often can be lengthy—would not on its own provide a basis for avoiding disclosures of a material cybersecurity incident.15  Forcing companies to disclose cyber incidents publicly and before they have a complete understanding of those incidents, mitigate the damage and vulnerabilities, and contain malicious 8 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, Pub.

Nefarious cyber actors—both criminal organizations and nation state actors—are adept at collecting intelligence on their victims and leveraging that information in their attacks and ransomware negotiations.16 Requiring the disclosure of information on ongoing incidents may allow hackers to identify the crown jewels or most valuable information held by an organization amongst vast quantities of data. It could also help attackers improve targeting, gain additional access, effect further damage, and, in the case of ransomware, demand larger ransoms. Public disclosure of an ongoing incident also puts companies at risk of follow on or copycat attacks by other malicious actors. For example, with the recent disclosure of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange server and Apache log4j, attackers were quick to exploit systems when patches were unavailable or not fully implemented.17 If the registrant is required to disclose an incident before completing remediation of the vulnerability by which an attacker gained access, other opportunistic attackers may identify and exploit the vulnerability to perpetrate further cyberattacks against the registrant. Similarly, if the method of attack is novel involving a zero day vulnerability for which no patch exists yet, other organizations which use the vulnerable system or software will also be exposed to attack.18 This is important for all cyber incident victims but presents grave national security risks as it relates to critical infrastructure and Federal partners.  Protecting this sensitive incident information was a priority for Congress during its recent consideration of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. Senate debate on the legislation reiterated this, saying the bill sought to ensure that entities are encouraged to and feel protected in disclosing cyber incidents.19 To achieve this, the statute limits the further sharing of and appropriate uses for reported information and establishes confidentiality and anonymization protections for sharing that information with relevant stakeholders.20 Congress devised these protections to avoid placing entities at risk by complying with the reporting requirements in the statute. The SECs requirement to disclose ongoing incidents could place registrants at greater risk, imperil the reporting information the Federal Government will receive under the now enacted Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, and complicate efforts to prevent future incidents. I also note that disclosure of an ongoing incident risks contradicting the SECs stated goal of reducing mispricing of securities because such information is preliminary and thus potentially inaccurate.21 If initial information on an incident subsequently proves inaccurate, premature 16 E.g., STAFF OF S.

(2021) (testimony of Jen Easterly, Director, CISA) 5 public disclosure risks providing investors with inaccurate information that could result in mispricing and ill informed investor decisions, assuming investors consider that information in making investment decisions. CYBER PLAN AND PROCEDURE DISCLOSURE The proposed rule would also require companies to disclose policies and procedures used to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats.22 Among other things, this includes policies to address cyber threats like intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, and violation of privacy laws.23 The proposed rule would also require companies to disclose detailed descriptions of their cybersecurity risk assessment programs, including whether companies retain third party providers as part of that plan.24 The level of specificity the proposed rule requires for these disclosures could implicitly identify a companys vulnerabilities so attackers could select the weakest targets and formulate a more effective attack strategy. This increased risk outweighs whatever limited value disclosing these procedures to investors might have. The SEC should consider these unintended risks and adopt a more restrained approach for achieving its goal to better inform investors of a companys approach to cyber risk management. Congress confronted a similar issue when drafting the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. During the drafting process, Congress sought to enable a coordinated, informed U.S. response to cyber attacks and warn other critical infrastructure operators similarly situated.25 Nevertheless, Congress was careful to only require the reporting of information that would directly contribute to a more coordinated United States response to cyber incidents. During a committee hearing on the legislation, I acknowledged this saying, there is a balance between getting information quickly, letting victims respond to an attack without imposing onerous requirements on them and getting accurate information. We understand that balance.26 This measured approach allowed Congress to be sure [it was] actually doing what [it] intend[ed] to do, which is to help both the private sector and governmental agencies deal with cyberattacks.27  CONGRESS INTENDED THAT THE CYBER INCIDENT REPORTING FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ACT BE THE PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR COMPANIES TO REPORT CYBER INCIDENTS The Commission cites growing concern that material cyber incidents are underreported . . . as the impetus for the proposed rule, referencing mid 2021 comments by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the Department of Homeland (We dont want to be flooded with reports saying, we detected something, were not sure whether theres actual impact or not. I think we need to make sure that theres determined impact). 22 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure 37 (Mar. 9, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 23 Id.  24 Id. at 37−38.  25 168 CONG.

The legislations requirement that DHS create a cyber incident reporting council to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize Federal incident reporting requirements serves as evidence of this intent.30  Congress considered expanding the legislations incident reporting requirements beyond critical infrastructure and whether to make such information public. Ultimately, Congress determined cyber incident reports should be submitted to CISA, by critical infrastructure, and remain confidential. This determination was made in part after considering some of the same issues discussed above, and concluding that reports from our most vital industry sectors would best position the Federal Government to respond to and mitigate attacks.31  CONCLUSION SECs proposed rule would increase cyber risks for many companies, could impair national security as it relates to critical infrastructure and Federal partners, and contradicts Congresss intent to harmonize cyber incident reporting requirements and provide appropriate protections for cyber incident information reported to the Government. I encourage SEC to reconsider or revise substantially the proposed rule.

Dear Ms. Countryman: We write to respectfully request that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalize, as proposed, rules requiring periodic disclosures by public companies regarding cybersecurity expertise on their boards of directors and managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures (the Proposal).  The Proposal would implement bipartisan legislation that we have introduced called the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act. That legislation directs the SEC to issue rules requiring each public company to disclose, in its annual report or annual proxy statement, whether any member of its governing body has expertise or experience in cybersecurity, including details necessary to describe fully the nature of that expertise or experience. And if no member has such expertise or experience, a company would be required to describe what other aspects of the companys cybersecurity were considered by any person, such as an official serving on a nominating committee, who is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for membership to the governing body. The Proposal follows the intent of our bill by encouraging directors to play a more effective role in cybersecurity risk oversight at public companies, and we commend the SEC for issuing a Proposal that would achieve this important goal.  We respectfully request that the SEC finalize Items 106(c) and 407(j) of Regulation S K as proposed. Item 106(c) would require disclosure about public companies cybersecurity governance, including the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk and a description of managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, the relevant experience of management, and its role in implementing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies. Item 407(j) would require disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors, if any, including the name of any director, and details to describe the nature of the expertise. I. Cybersecurity is an important component of long term shareholder value. Cybersecurity incidents have never been more frequent, complex, and costly. Last year, the overall number of data breaches reached an all time high of 1,862, up 23% year over year.1  Almost all of these data breaches were caused by cyberattacks. The average cost of a data breach has also reached an all time high last year of $4.24 million, up 10% year over year.2 To take one concrete example at the high end of this scale, the Equifax breach in 2017 ultimately cost the company over $1.7 billion.3 Companies of all sizes and in many industries have experienced serious cybersecurity incidents with significant impacts on customers, counterparties, and investors.  Investors often bear the costs associated with these incidents. The Proposal details a number of specific costs to companies and shareholders, including payments to meet ransom, liability for stolen information, increased insurance premiums, lost revenues due to theft of intellectual property, reputational damage, and litigation costs.4 These costs culminate in damage not only to a companys profitability, but also to its stock price. According to a report by leading economic consulting firms, a severe cybersecurity breach causes an average permanent decline in a companys valuation of 1.8%.5 The Proposal would provide investors with the disclosure they deserve regarding how public companies plan to guard against these risks before they materialize. II. The Proposal provides powerful incentives for public companies to bolster cybersecurity, preserving long term shareholder value.  Prudent management of cybersecurity risk is important to maintaining long term shareholder value. Directors therefore have a responsibility to manage this risk and contribute to a companys cybersecurity. But corporate boards are struggling to meet this important obligation. Only 40% of boards have a director with cybersecurity experience.6 And a recent survey by consulting firm EY confirmed a deficiency of cybersecurity expertise at the C suite level.7 Indeed, according to a recent survey, 60% of directors dont believe that cybersecurity should get in the way of business operations.8 The Proposal appropriately recognizes that boards must be more vigilant because cybersecurity is among the most significant challenges companies face.  1 Identity Theft Resource Center, Annual Data Breach Report (2022), at 5. 2 IBM Security, Cost of a Data Breach Report (2021), at 4, https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY. 3 Ben Lane, Housingwire, Equifax Expects to Pay Out Another $100 Million for Data Breach, February 14, 2020, https://www.housingwire.com/articles/equifax expects to pay out another 100 million for data breach/. 4 Proposal, at 16592. 5 CGI, The Cyber Value Connection; Revealing the Link Between Cyber Vulnerability and Company Value (Aug. 2018), at 6, https://www.cgi.com/sites/default/files/2018 08/cybervalueconnection_full_report_final_lr.pdf. 6 National Association of Corporate Directors and the Internet Security Alliance, Cyber risk Oversight: Key Principles and Practical Guidance for Corporate Boards (2020), at 68, http://isalliance.org/wp content/uploads/2020/02/RD 3 2020_NACD_Cyber_Handbook__WEB_022020.pdf. 7 Chuck Seets, EY, Cybersecurity: Staying Vigilant Through Prevention, Oversight and Governance, January 18, 2022, https://www.ey.com/en_us/assurance/cybersecurity staying vigilant through prevention oversight and governance. 8 National Association of Corporate Directors, Public Company Governance Survey (2020), at 19, https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp content/uploads/2020/01/2019 2020 Public Company Survey.pdf. 2 The Proposal would create powerful incentives for public companies to pay greater attention to cybersecurity risks. According to a report by the prior Administrations Council of Economic Advisors, mandatory disclosure requirements were previously shown to incentivize firms to adopt better cybersecurity measures.9 The Proposals board level expertise disclosure requirement is a prime example of such an incentive. The North American Securities Administrators Association agrees that [i]ncentivizing publicly traded companies to consider whether or not they have appropriate cybersecurity expertise on their governing body is a common sense way to promote greater attention to cybersecurity risk by public corporations. Investors and customers are well served by policies that encourage companies to consider such risks proactively, as opposed to after a data breach has already occurred, when such investors and customers have already been harmed.10 Proposed Item 106(c) of Regulation S K would direct public companies to provide these exact disclosures.  The disclosures in the Proposal will also enable investors to hold public companies accountable. In a letter of support for the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, the Council of Institutional Investors stated its belief that cybersecurity is an integral component of a boards role in risk oversight. 11 In another letter of support, the California Public Employees Retirement System said that this approach will ensure that investors have access to decision useful information to better assess the ability of corporate management to adequately address cybersecurity risks.12 And according to consulting firm EY, remaining cyber resilient and building stakeholder trust in the companys data security and privacy practices is a strategic imperative. Public disclosures can help build trust by providing transparency and assurance around how boards are fulfilling their cybersecurity risk oversight responsibilities.13 If public companies provide the market with more insights into their governance of cybersecurity risks, then investors will be better equipped to decide whether to invest in a public company and how to vote in elections for directors. III. Cybersecurity poses unique risks to public companies, which justify the disclosures required by the Proposal. The unique harms caused by cybersecurity breaches justify the Proposal. According to testimony by Professor John Coates of Harvard Law School before the Senate Banking Committee: [T]here is maybe going to be some suggestion that there is a slippery slope and there is all kinds of risks and that cyber is one of them and so on. I really do want to emphasize that cyber is unique. Other than financial risk, where we already have an obligation for boards to say do they have financial expertise on the board or not, 9 White House Council of Economic Advisers, The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy (Feb. 2018), at 25, https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/17664 council economic advisors cost. 10 Letter from North American Securities Administrators Association to Sen.

It is very hard to think of a public company in this network age that is not at least somewhat exposed to cyber risk.14 This is precisely why cybersecurity risk warrants special attention from the SEC. The Proposal is narrowly tailored to require disclosure of board level expertise that is important to mitigating this singular risk to public companies profitability and valuation.  Moreover, the Proposal accomplishes this goal while providing appropriate discretion to public companies to define what constitutes cybersecurity expertise and to address cybersecurity risks through any means they see fit. The Proposal, like our legislation, does not mandate that any companys board actually have a person with expertise in cybersecurity or require companies to take any actions other than to provide this disclosure. We respectfully request that the SEC adopt this flexible disclosure approach over mandating any set of best practices, in order to encourage boards to develop approaches that are tailored to mitigate risks to the specific set of shareholders to which they are accountable. * * * Thank you for proposing rules to implement our bipartisan legislation.

TechNet is the national, bipartisan network of technology CEOs and senior executives that promotes the growth of the innovation economy by advocating a targeted policy agenda at the federal and 50 state level. TechNets diverse membership includes dynamic American businesses ranging from startups to the most iconic companies on the planet and represents over four million employees and countless customers in the fields of information technology, e commerce, the sharing and gig economies, advanced energy, cybersecurity, venture capital, and finance. Securing intellectual property, safeguarding our economy and critical infrastructure, and protecting American consumers and businesses from cybersecurity risks has never been more important. World events, including Russias unprovoked and heinous attacks on Ukraine, highlight the pressing need to defend against cyberattacks. In response, Americas tech leaders are taking unprecedented steps to support Ukraine, isolate Russia, and ensure our national security, both overseas and here at home. With todays world growing more connected by the second, defending our critical infrastructure and protecting our data will require close collaboration between Americas technology sector and the government. Each cybersecurity intrusion puts the integrity of financial markets, national security, and utility services at risk, threatens businesses, especially small ones, and violates civil liberties through personal data theft and stolen identity. Per the Office of the Director of National Intelligences 2021 Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, cybersecurity is among the top areas of concern for national security. TechNet realizes the urgency of improving our nations cybersecurity resiliency and appreciates the seriousness of which the United States Government (USG) is approaching this matter.  TECHNET THE VOICE OF THE INNOVATION ECONOMY   2 Significant efforts have been taken by the USG to safeguard our critical infrastructure against cybersecurity threats. Currently, the White House Office of the National Cyber Director, National Security Council, Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Justice, Congress, and other federal agencies are doubling down on efforts to secure the nations critical infrastructure.  These efforts include implementing a statutory framework to report confirmed cyber intrusions, creating a unified and collaborative approach to encourage public/private information sharing, and making investments in the workforce to better equip Americans with the skills to fill the nearly 600,000 current open cyber positions. The private sector, which owns or operates much of the countrys critical infrastructure, remains critical to executing our countrys overall cybersecurity strategy. The breadth of expertise and talent in the private sector can be used to help shape government processes and implement successful, cross industry best practices. It is of the utmost importance for the USG to continue to recognize the numerous benefits that come from partnering with American businesses. As the SEC seeks to move beyond the 2018 Interpretative Release, TechNet appreciates the opportunity to provide constructive feedback and share our concerns with the proposed rule. Cyber Intrusion Prioritization Currently, a companys response to a cyber intrusion is to identify and remediate the invasion, collaborate with law enforcement and CISA, and determine the victims of the attack. The proposed rule implements a 4 day timeline to report intrusions to the SEC. This restrictive and arbitrary timeline forces the reallocation of valuable resources from mitigating the attack and protecting consumers data to alerting investors. Relatedly, under the proposed rule, a public company would need to be able to assess whether a particular incident at a third party service provider would have a material impact on the company and thereby trigger a Form 8 K filing. It is essential that companies have time to make this assessment as it takes a significant amount of time and effort to do this for acquisitions and other third party services.  Providing accurate and holistic data to investors is important and should be done after a thorough investigation has been conducted to determine the attack is material, as prescribed in this proposed rule. The proposed rule, however, includes ambiguous examples of material cybersecurity incidents that seem to encompass many types of intrusions. Companies could be hurried in making the determination of a material intrusion based on incomplete information, therefore erring on the side of abundant caution and, as a result, deem more incidents as material than necessary. Premature disclosures of potential intrusions to the SEC could prove harmful to investors and the general public if the shared information is not fully TECHNET THE VOICE OF THE INNOVATION ECONOMY   3  vetted and the incident is not remediated, potentially inviting additional cyberattacks.  Burdensome Reporting Requirements Currently, every state has data breach notification laws that companies must follow. In addition, the USG is already implementing a reporting framework administered through CISA to aid and support companies within 72 hours of an intrusion. The additional reporting requirements proposed in this rule go far beyond the 2018 Interpretative Release and further complicate the compliance practices when a cyber intrusion occurs. New Item 106 of Regulation S K and Amending Item 407 of Regulation S K The proposed rule adds a new Item 106 of Regulation S K that would oblige a registrant to disclose the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk, managements role in assessing and managing such risk, managements cybersecurity expertise, and managements role in implementing the registrants cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies. Furthermore, the rule proposes amending Item 407 of Regulation S K to require the disclosure of whether any member of the registrants board has expertise in cybersecurity, and if so, the nature of such expertise.  The nature of these new requirements is ambiguous and the disclosure of board expertise in other areas is not required. While cybersecurity preparedness is important to investors, there are many other factors that impact stock prices, perhaps more drastically than a cyber intrusion. The benefits of this new reporting requirement appear unfounded and pose minimal benefit to investors while adding additional compliance burdens to companies. Disclosure of a Registrants Risk Management, Strategy and Governance Regarding Cybersecurity Risks The SECs proposed rule includes Item 106(b) of Regulation S K to require registrants to provide more consistent and informative disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management and strategy. The SEC further proposes that disclosure of the relevant policies and procedures, to the extent a registrant has established any, would benefit investors by providing greater transparency as to the registrants strategies and actions to manage cybersecurity risks. Further clarification on the use and application of this information would be critical to understanding the efficacy of this new requirement. Potential Disclosure of Proprietary Information Proposed Item 106(b) would require registrants to disclose its policies and procedures, if it has any, to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats, including: Operational risk; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk. Some of the information that falls under this TECHNET THE VOICE OF THE INNOVATION ECONOMY   4  requirement could be privileged and confidential, and the benefit provided to investors by its public disclosure is unclear. At the same time, public disclosure of this sensitive information will provide malicious actors with details about companies cyber risk management programs potentially increasing the risk of successful future cyber attacks. TechNet appreciates this opportunity to submit comments to this proposed rule.  Cybercrime cost the world economy nearly $1 trillion last year alone. As policies and regulations are created to meet the evolving technological landscape and the growing threat cyber attacks pose to our economy and infrastructure, it is important that new rules prioritize building a partnership with the private sector to strengthen the nations cybersecurity resiliency.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The Internet Security Alliance (ISA) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the SECs or the Commissions) proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (2022).i ISA particularly wishes to thank the Commission staff for meeting with the ISA board to discuss the critical issues raised in the NPRM. Cybersecurity is not like Enronii or WorldComiii and other high profile SEC cases where the Commission correctly stands in for the consumer/investor. In the cybersecurity world, the attackers are stealing individual information and value, corporate intellectual property and national secrets. In this space the Commission, industry, the investor, and the government are all on the same side. In addition, we are collectively facing an intensely collaborative attack community. The Commission can best serve the interests of the investor community by helping the rest of government and industry to work collaboratively to build a sustainably secure cyber system. Should the Commission choose to follow some of the comments ISA makes below, ISA would be happy to continue to work collaboratively with the Commission toward that mutual goal. In 2018, the Commission issued interpretive guidanceiv to reinforce and expand upon the 2011 guidance. The agency addressed the importance of 2  cybersecurity policies and procedures and the application of insider trading prohibitions in the context of cybersecurity. The SEC says that while companies disclosures of both material cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management and governance have improved since then, disclosure practices are inconsistent.  According to the SEC, its proposed amendments would include these important changes to the agencys reporting requirements:  • Require current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K.  • Require periodic disclosures regarding, among other things:  o A registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. o Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures. o A board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk. o Updates about previously reported material cybersecurity incidents. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF ISA COMMENTS * ISA has a long history of working to enhance corporate cybersecurity and offers this expertise to the Commission in order to help develop appropriate, useful approaches to disclosures of cyber risk management practices. In ISAs continued effort to enhance corporate cybersecurity, it has developed nearly a dozen open source products that have been embraced by both industry and government entities (including but not limited to the United States). Included in these products is a set of corporate cyber risk oversight principles and practices that have been independently assessed and found to enhance a wide range of positive security outcomes. These principles and practices have been described in peer reviewed academic literature as constituting a de facto standard for appropriate cyber risk oversight and management. They thus can legitimately be considered best practices which the Commission should consider in place of the 3  undefined strategies, and procedures alluded to in the NPRM Disclosure of these independently assessed and successful cyber risk strategies principles and practices may well be a preferable alternative to the policy and procedures required under the proposed rule as they have been shown to enhance corporate cybersecurity and, hence, demonstrate to investors sound cybersecurity governance, but do not bring any of the potential negative consequences many in industry fear will result if the rule, as proposed, is implemented. • ISA is concerned that the Securities and Exchange Commission may be underestimating the difficulty of accurately detecting, mitigating and addressing cybersecurity incidents. The commission may also be underestimating the pressures organizations will feel to comply with the new proposed regulations and that hasty judgements, based on short timelines and incomplete data, may well result in inaccurate signals to the market and thus enhance, rather than mitigate, mis pricing. * ISA believes it is unclear, based on empirical evidence, if there is need for the new SEC proposed rule on cybersecurity. ISA believes the best course for the Commission to proceed into this area, where it has comparatively limited data and expertise, by following the universally approved process in the cybersecurity field of risk management. A risk management approach would carefully balance benefit and risk based on empirical data. ISA notes that the Commission acknowledges in its NPRM that it currently lacks the empirical data by which to measure the benefits that the NPRM speculates will result from the proposed rule. ISA suggests the SEC commission research leveraging some of the many disclosure systems already in existence to empirically determine the current degree of market mis pricing under existing guidance and use that as the basis to calculate the amount of benefits the new rules would create. Following the risk management model, these benefits would then be balanced against the risks the new rules will create. ISA suggests that this more deliberate and evidence based process is especially appropriate in the cybersecurity field, which has direct impacts not only for investors but for broader concerns including national security. * Form 8 K should specify that any disclosure requirement for a material cybersecurity incident shall only be triggered four days after the company reasonably determines that the incident has been contained (not four days after a 4  determination of materiality). Many vulnerabilities can be/are embargoed for extended periods once discovered. This is done to give the affected companies time to fix the problem, create patches, or ship the fixes to their customers. Although impact/materiality may be assessed at some point, organizations need time to deal with understanding the scope of the impact and actioning any remediations. Additionally, as will be discussed in greater detail below, information disclosed in policy and procedure could provide inference points to an attacker — the unknown or unrealized details about the organization (countries they operate in, JVs, vendors, technologies, domains, et. al.) Providing companies with additional time would allow for a more fulsome, accurate, and relevant disclosure to investors. It would be akin to waiting until the firefighters had extinguished all the flames in the building before asking for such key elements as a description of the nature and scope of the fire, an inventory of the property that was damaged, the effect on building operations, and what steps had been taken to prevent future fires. A delayed disclosure obligation would eliminate the risk that the adversary would accelerate or broaden its attack or adjust its tactics upon learning of the disclosure before all vulnerabilities are discovered and patched by the company under attack as well as others that may face similar vulnerabilities. Allowing more time for disclosure also would help cyber first responders focus their valuable time and resources on remediation and recovery from the incident and not devote unnecessary time to crisis communications and public relations while facts are still emerging and being confirmed.  • Any disclosure obligation should apply only to the owner or operator of IT systems, and not the user or customer as currently contemplated by the Proposed Rule. To the extent that a customer is informed of an incident, the customer is often bound by confidentiality obligations and provided limited information. This would make assessing materiality difficult if not impossible. * ISA is extremely concerned that the disclosures required under the new rule will provide greater assistance to the attack community than to investors and hence, following a risk management theory, the rule, as currently written, should not be implemented. These risks are magnified for certain industry sectors such as Defense Industrial Base (DIB). ISA offers alternative constructions which will allow for adequate investor knowledge of cybersecurity governance and risk 5  management but not create enhanced cyber risk to investors, industry, and the nation.  * ISA notes that the Commission appropriately raises the issue of regulatory conflict and redundancy with respect to current cyber disclosure rules even noting the inconsistent reporting under current guidance as a reason for the new proposed rules. ISA notes that it is not necessary to expand the rules as done in the NPRM, in order to clarify reporting under current rules and establish greater consistency of reporting. Moreover, ISA believes the proposed SEC rules will significantly exacerbate the problem of regulatory conflict and duplication.  Further, ISA emphasizes that the regulatory conflict and redundancy in this space is not simply a case of administrative waste, but seriously impacts corporate, and therefore national, cybersecurity practice as it distracts already very scarce cybersecurity resources, and as such is harmful to investors. ISA suggests the Commission forestall adding to this problem and instead allow the newly created Office of National Cybersecurity Director in the White House to carry out its legislatively mandated process of streamlining the disclosure process, after which point, the Commission can act if necessary.  * ISA believes that the proposed new rules will open the door to potentially substantial stock manipulation triggered by timed negative disclosures which the new rule would facilitate. ISA notes the Commission acknowledges this prospect in the NPRM and argues the proposed 4 day reporting requirement mitigates against this threat. ISA believes the Commissions argument in this case underestimates the ability of the sophisticated attack community (e.g., Cybersecurity attacker group FIN4)v to manipulate the new rules. ISA offers alternative actions the Commission can take that would not create this prospect. WHO IS THE INTERNET SECURITY ALLIANCE (ISA)?  The Internet Security Alliance is a coalition of private sector organizations founded in 2002. The ISA board consists of senior cybersecurity professionals representing virtually every portion of the government identified critical industry sectors.1 ISA sells no products or services. ISA does not take advertising and does not endorse any products, services, or individuals, including the products and services of its member companies. ISA doesnt have a PAC or a lobbyist. ISAs sole    1 Internet Security Alliance Board, https://isalliance.org/about isa/board of directors/  6  mission is to integrate advanced technology with economics and public policy to create a sustainable system of cybersecurity. ISA spends roughly equal amounts of its time focused on public policy as well as corporate cyber risk oversight and management. In addition to numerous other awards, ISA has twice been named to the National Association of Corporate Directors Corporate 100 list of the most influential organizations in the field of corporate governance. SEC CAN USE ISAS EXPERTISE IN PROMOTING EFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY TO ENHANCE INVESTOR KNOWLEDGE  In 2012, ISA, in conjunction with AIG, approached the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and proposed developing a coherent set of best practices for corporate boards to best implement their responsibility for cyber risk oversight. Over the past decade ISA, in partnership with NACD has produced three editions of the Cyber Risk Oversight Handbook,vi which NACD reports is their most popular publication. ISA was pleased to note the Commission cited this work seven times in its NPRM. The handbooks are built around a set of five principles boards should follow to practice good corporate governance of cybersecurity. The handbooks also speak to the required coordination of the board with the management team as they fulfill their role in implementing the cyber risk management function. In summary, these principles are:  • Boards need to address cyber risk at the board level as a strategic enterprise wide risk and not simply from an IT perspective  • Boards need to fully appreciate their unique legal obligations for cyber risk oversight  • Boards need to acquire access to appropriate expertise in cyber risk management • Boards should require management to develop an enterprise wide structure to manage cyber risk both from a technological and corporate governance perspective and assure adequate budget and time spent on cyber issues at board meetings • Boards should require management to perform a comprehensive, empirically based, cyber risk assessment, including the potential costs from cyber events, as well as providing an assessment of which risks they recommend be accepted, rejected, mitigated or transferred and how these 7  functions will be implemented consistent with the risk appetite and business plan approved by the board of directors. The handbooks also provide a series of tool kits facilitating boards oversight of the management team on specific cybersecurity issues such as supply chain, insider threat, M&A and economically based cyber risk metrics and others. To our knowledge, the NACD ISA handbook is the only private sector produced publication that has been endorsed by both the US Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice. ISA is currently working with the NACD on the fourth edition of the US Cyber Risk Oversight handbook, due to be published in 2023.  An article in the March 2021 editions of Cyber Security: A Peer Reviewed Journal, International Principles for Boards of Directors and Cybersecurity, by Larry Clinton)vii references to these principles and practices as a de facto standard for appropriate cyber risk oversight and management. Although, in candor, the article was written by ISA President Clinton, the reference appears in a peer reviewed professional journal. That taken with the multiple endorsements from both industry and government around the world would seem to appropriately qualify these principles and as best practices which the Commission should consider in place of the undefined and unassessed strategies, and procedures alluded to in the NPRM. In addition, since the NACD ISA principles are clearly articulated and consistent across multiple domains they would provide a clearer guide for industry, the investor community and the Commission in assessing if an organization is appropriately engaging in cyber risk management and oversite. As such these practices are preferable in many respects to the rule in the NPRM.  ISA has also developed adapted versions of this handbook for use around the world. There are now 10 separate editions of the handbook available on four continents and in five languages. These include a German edition in partnership with Germanys Federal Information Security Division  BSI  and the Cybersecurity Foundation of Germany (a second edition has been completed and will be release later in 2022), a pan European edition developed in partnership with the European Council of Directors Associations, a Latin American edition developed in cooperation with the OAS, a Japanese edition developed in 8  cooperation with the Japanese Business Federation, an Indian edition developed in partnership with the Associations of Indian Infrastructure Organizations, and an East Asian edition in partnership with AIG. This year ISA also produced a separate edition targeted at college/university and foundations in conjunction with the Association of Governing Boards.  These Cyber Risk Handbooks are one of the only sets of best practices to have been independently assessed and found to generate tangible pro security outcomes. PWC, in their annual Global Information Security Survey reported that organizations that used the principles highlighted in the handbook experienced a range of positive security outcomes including better cyber risk management, closer alignment between cybersecurity and overall business goals, better cyber budgeting, and creating a culture of security. In 2021 the World Economic Forum joined ISA and NACD in promoting a similar set of cyber best practices for corporate boards adding a sixth principle which called upon corporate boards to extend their oversight of cyber risk to their full eco system, not just that of their own organization. This sixth principle will be added to the 2023 US edition of the NACD ISA Cyber Risk Oversight handbook.  The Commissions NPRM speaks not only to the need for boards to engage in effective cyber risk oversight activity, but management as well. ISA agrees with the need for a coordinated and coherent board management partnership. To that end, ISA has published a new book that takes the cyber risk oversight principles and toolkits detailed in the handbooks and translates them down to the management level. This book, Cybersecurity for Business: Organization Wide Strategies to Ensure that Cyber Risk is Not (just) an IT Issue has been #1 on Amazons Hot New Releases list for the past month and has already been accepted for use in cybersecurity courses at Columbia, Wharton, NYU, and Indiana University.  As will be discussed in more detail below, it is not the concept of disclosure about cybersecurity that is problematic as much as the types and methods of disclosure that ISA urges be reconsidered. ISA believes that requiring public companies to disclose if they follow a set of independently assessed cyber risk oversight and management principles, such as those articulated in the NACD ISA handbooks, will provide investors with a much clearer understanding of how cyber risk is being addressed by an organization, without carrying with it the risk 9  of weakening the security enterprise, enhancing stock manipulation or wasting scarce cybersecurity resources.  THE COMMISSION MAY BE UNDERESTIMATING THE DIFFICULTY IN PROPERLY ASSESSING AND MANAGING CYBER ATTACKS  While filing a series of reports to the Commission may not be difficult, especially for a larger organization with a sophisticated compliance infrastructure, accurately detecting, analyzing, mitigating, and assessing cyber attacks is extremely complicated. ISA believes it is worth noting on the outset that cybersecurity is fundamentally different than many traditional Commission areas of inquiry. Most cyber incidents of significance are more the result of the unbalanced economics of the digital age than corporate misfeasance or malfeasance. In the cybersecurity field virtually all the economic incentives favor the attacker. Cyber attack methods are comparatively cheap and easy to acquire, the profits from successful attacks can me be massive the attackers business model is very favorable (they can use the same methods all over the world repeatedly). The defender community very often is completely out resourced by the attacker, while defending an immense and inherently vulnerable system (the internet was built to be an open system) and there is almost no law enforcement. We successfully prosecute less than 1% of cyber criminals.  Cyber attacks are often engineered by sophisticated, well funded (often better funded than the victims) actors who may be nation states or state affiliated. Even many of the criminals not directly associated with governments, have been trained by those governments, have tools equivalent to that of the nation state and are allowed to carry out these activities with impunity to prosecution. ISA fears the Commission may be underestimating the difficulty involved in determining accurately the impact of the crime or even the extent of the crime scene especially while in the process of mitigating it. To take a well known example, consider the case of the SolarWinds incident. FireEye publicly disclosed a breach into their environment on Dec 8, 10  2020. They cited we are actively investigating in coordination with the FBI and other key partners, including Microsoft, suggesting the investigation had been ongoing for some time and potentially back to November. Although numerous portions of the federal government had been successfully compromised by the attack, the broader government was unaware until notified — voluntarily — by the private sector. Based on knowledge at the point of detection it was apparent that this was a severe attack — quite possibly material — but the extent and how to respond took weeks to plan. On December 13, 5 days later, FireEye provided a follow up blog post and customer call identifying SolarWinds as the source of the initial intrusion. FireEye filed an 8 k on December 13 and SolarWinds on December 14. Per the proposed timelines, 8 K disclosure would have been required while the parties were still investigating, coordinating response actions, preparing to notify customers, working with authorities, etc. FireEyes response to the SolarWinds incident is viewed in the cybersecurity field as what good looks like. The SEC proposed requirements would suggest it was not fast enough. The SECs proposal to require reporting of material cyber incidents to investors within four business days of determining the incident is material will create situations in which companies would be required to make complex determinations on materiality with a dearth of information available at early stages In clarifying its expectations under the new proposed rule the Commission states The Commission notes that if it adopts the date of the materiality determination as the Form 8 K reporting trigger, the agency would expect registrants to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible. The agency adds that ‘a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident to address the belief that some companies may delay making such a determination to avoid a disclosure obligation.  As such, the new rule will very likely create inordinate pressure for hasty reporting which will lead to the very mis pricing the Commission is trying to prevent as well as far greater risk such as to national security. CISOs on the ISA board have reported that many times they have led investigations into incidents that looked really bad that turned out to be much less damaging once the full picture became apparent. 11  In still a different scenario the judgement on likely materiality may be quickly apparent, such as in a ransomware attack where the demand is clearly a material hit to the company. This virtually instantaneous reasonable judgment of materiality could precede accurate analysis and mitigation, which could take  weeks or months depending on the unique situation. Yet, under the proposed rule, the victimized company may reasonably be in no position to make an adequate and useful report after 4 days, even with 100% whole hearted efforts. The FireEye/SolarWinds example deals with highly sophisticated companies. As another example consider a mid sized company that discovers an incident/intrusion but is unsure of the extent of impact. There will be substantial internal pressure from Risk & Compliance to meet the new SEC reporting timelines. If discovered on a Monday, and if it has the potential to be material, the risk department will very likely push teams to report on Friday. The experience of ISA board members suggests that for a company that will need outside help, the timeline is unrealistic, and could very well mis inform investors. Given the immense complexity of the technologies, the business methods, the attack vectors, and the uniqueness of many of the most serious cyber attacks the ISA recommends that the Commission return to its previous view that guidance, as opposed to strict regulation is the most appropriate position for the SEC to take with respect to cybersecurity. While ISA appreciates the Commissions desire for consistency in reporting, the reality is that the traditional one size fits all regulatory model is inappropriate to dealing with the highly dynamic and idiosyncratic space of cybersecurity. Clear guidance is a better model.  In addition, the proposed SEC rule defines a cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, the proposed definition of which would include information resources owned or used by the registrant. We believe this language is problematic because a company may use many systems to process its data, including vendor systems used in numerous software as a service, platform as a service, or infrastructure as a service offerings provide by external vendors, over which it has no operational control. In such circumstances, where companies often rely on such vendors to inform them of details of cyber incidents impacting the vendor systems, companies may have particular challenges in obtaining sufficient 12  information from the vendors (who in turn may be hesitant to promptly share detailed incident information with the company due to liability concerns) to make an informed materiality determination.  ISA also suggests that the amount of disclosure from multiple separate entities involved in corporate supply chains required by the proposed rule could create an avalanche of reports from widely varied perspectives based on organizations inter relationships. This cacophony of reports may be extremely difficult for investors (and possibly the Commission) to navigate and clearly comprehend, which will not only undermine the benefit the Commission hopes for but enhance mis pricing. ISA recommends that at minimum, in the definition of information systems,, change owned or used by the registrant to owned or operated by the registrant, since companies can more reasonably be expected to timely obtain sufficient information about incidents on systems that they own or actually operate.  ARE THE COMMISSIONS NEW PROPOSED RULES NEEDED?  Unlike traditional financial compliance wherein an organization can be determined to be in compliance or not (pass fail) cybersecurity is different.  Cybersecurity is best understood as a range  one is not secure vs. insecure. Leaders in cybersecurity engage in a systematic and empirically based risk assessment process that balances risk vs benefit. Simply reviewing a checklist of policies and procedures will tell an investor little about the actual cyber risk posture of an organization. What is more informative is the methods the organization uses to assess its unique cyber risk, determine its unique cyber risk appetite, and allocate resources. Descriptions of the actual strategies, practices and procedures is unnecessary and likely not truly informative and can even create misinformation. The SECs proposal to require reporting of material cyber incidents to investors within four business days of determining the incident is material will create situations in which companies would be required to make complex determinations on materiality with a dearth of information available at early stages of the incident, while also potentially making disclosures with incorrect 13  information. Sophisticated cyber events are often characterized by ingenious methods designed to create mis direction. Hence, timeliness must not be confused with haste.  A 2022 IBM study reported that, in 2021, it took an average of 212 days to identify a breach and an average 75 days to contain a breach, for a total lifecycle of 287 days. It is now cliché to note that much is unknown in the early hazy days of an incident, including the type and scope of information potentially impacted.  It is likely that such a short disclosure timeframe would lead to rushed disclosures of information that ultimately turns out to be incorrect, thus creating a disservice to investors and at least a temporarily impact to the pricing of securities, based on such incorrect information. Thus, the proposed rule may create the very mis priced value  the Commission is hoping to address. Moreover, recent independent research indicates that actual material cyber incidents are quite rare Given the inherent vulnerability of digital systems (the Internet itself was built as an open system) cyber risk policies are best considered on a risk management basis which carefully weighs cyber risk vs. costs. Any benefits of cyber disclosure need to similarly be carefully balanced with other considerations including organizational and national security.  In its NPRM the Commission asserts that the value of timely disclosure to shareholders outweighs the risks of premature disclosure but provides very little evidence to support this assertion. In fact, the NPRM states: we are unable to quantify the potential benefit to investors and others as the result of increased disclosure and improvement in pricing under the proposed amendments. This estimation requires information about fundamental value and extent of mispricing. We do not have access to such information.  Its important to note that the Commission already has strong guidance in place for appropriately disclosing cyber events that would materially impact investors. Independent research suggests these rules are adequate and effective.  For example, a 2022 study of 1,200 large companies by ThoughtLab found the percentage of breaches that were material (defined as generating a large loss, compromising many records, or having a significant impact on business operations) was less than 1% of all breaches  .07 % in 2021 and .08% in 2022. The Commissions NPRM itself cites a study indicating that firms with higher cyber 14  risk have a higher cost of capital which suggests investors operating under current guidance are aware of and considering cyber risk.  In its NPRM, the Commission does not contend that cyber incidents impact investors, only that disclosure of cyber incidents impacts shareholders. However, the vast majority of cyber attacks are not publicly disclosed, and probably ought not be because, current research suggests the vast majority of such incidents are not material. Since it is the disclosure of events that impacts stock prices and the new rule will increase disclosures, the new rule runs the risk of taking immaterial events and turning them into material events via disclosure  all without clear evidence of how much the disclosures will help the investors.  Given that the extent of current disclosure about cyber events under the SEC guidance is well above 1%, it would seem the current guidance is working effectively. A more tailored study testing the Commissions theory that cyber incidents create mispricing or market asymmetry might be prudent. ISA recommends that before proceeding into this area of undocumented benefit and potentially high risk, the SEC commission research leveraging any of the many existing cyber disclosure models and determine if their hypothesis of the fundamental value or mispricing exists and to what extent. Based on this empirical risk management approach the Commission will develop more grounded and effective public policy and thus protect investors appropriately. THE COMMISSIONS NEW PROPOSED RULE WILL LIKELY ASSIST ATTACKERS MORE THAN INVESTORS  The NPRM acknowledges that there is risk that their more extensive disclosure may increase the risk of attack but suggests this added risk might be mitigated due to increased security efforts responsive to the new rule. In the end the academic literature on this issue is inconclusive. Obviously, there is substantial debate as to exactly what information will be, should be, or must be disclosed under the new proposed rule, and when.  However, we do know that the attack community is highly sophisticated  often nation state affiliated. Accordingly, whatever information is disclosed under the 15  proposed rule will more likely be better understood and of more use to the expert attacker community than it will be for the typical investor. The disclosures will either be informative or not. If disclosures of security policies and procedures are sufficiently informative for an investor to make a reasoned judgement about the security of an entity, it will almost, by definition, be informative enough to provide useful information to attackers. Conversely, if the information is not useful to the attack community with all its expertise and cybersecurity specific resources, it is difficult to believe it will be sufficiently informative to the investor to make a well informed judgment on the companys security. Even if the Commission could somehow craft a Goldilocks solution  just the right information for the investor, but not enough to aid the attacker  maintaining that balance in the highly volatile cybersecurity environment will be virtually impossible.  ISA notes, because it may take companies longer than four business days to contain a major cyber incident, requiring public disclosures about an incident before it is internally contained could tip off bad actors to the fact that a company is presently vulnerable to cyber attacks, leading to additional cyber attacks.  During that remediation period, there is a significant concern that any disclosure of the matter could cause other attackers to piggyback and attack the company.  It has been argued by some that the opposite would occur, i.e., that hackers would stay away from a company handling a breach as it would be a harder target now, as the company would be considered to be better prepared to defend itself. ISA finds that argument to be wishful thinking. In several instances, including the recent example of T Mobileviii , a company that has been attacked and disclosed 6 breaches in the past four years, we have seen attackers repeatedly going after a previously compromised target.  Attackers are often sophisticated enough to know that virtually all organizations suffer from a shortage of cybersecurity resources. These resources will only become more stressed while addressing a sophisticated attack (which may still be on going) and will be additionally diverted by simultaneously compiling with SEC (and likely other) regulatory compliance procedures. Attackers are aware of this and will almost certainly smell blood in the water and pile on 16  additional attacks against the weakened and distracted target. Moreover, attackers have an almost unlimited amount of attack methods, so the fact that an organization is fending off attack method A does not necessarily assist them when they then need to address attack method B (and possibly C, D, E, F, & G) from multiple attackers.  Finally, under the new proposed rules, the company may be required to publicly report the existence of a zero day vulnerability in vendor software used by many other companies. This disclosure would appear to be required without a chance to responsibly report the vulnerability to the software vendor in confidence and allowing them a chance to issue a patch before the vulnerability is publicized. Public disclosure of such unpatched, zero day vulnerabilities could tip off bad actors to look for other victims using the software (e.g., the SolarWinds case) to attack, leading to additional cyber attacks across industries. Additionally, it is also costly and impracticable for issuers to continuously monitor third party systems. It is unfair to hold a company liable for disclosures related to events that it does not control. At a minimum, the SEC should give companies a safe harbor against liability for failure to disclose a third party breach.  ISA suggests the Commission alter its focus for disclosure away from security policies and procedures and toward information that will be more helpful for the investor and less helpful to the attacker. One example would be reporting the costs of cyber events to the organization. ISA suggested that a disclosure of the actual costs of cyber within the organization may be more informative to investors than a disclosure of cyber practices and policies which investors may reasonably not understand. With cost information, investors can make their own determinations of the significance cyber attacks have on the company and can track if these costs are being increased or reduced . The costs would be a clear, objective measure that could also be compared to that of industry peers. While cost data on cyber incidents would provide the investor with a practical insight as to the ability of an organization to manage its cyber systems it would not provide any useful data to malicious actors that might enable future attacks.  Alternatively, a disclosure of what models the organization uses to make its cyber risk assessment, without disclosure of specific policies and procedures 17  that result from that assessment, could be disclosed These sophisticated models (e.g., X Analytics, FAIR, or Security Q) are publicly available and, thus, investors could use them to gauge the sophistication of the organization is assessing and managing risk without disclosing specific practices and procedures which will be useful to the attack community.  At minimum, ISA urges the SEC to reevaluate the trigger for reporting within four business days of determining that it has experienced a material incident and allow for reporting to occur after the company has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to and resolve the incident. We also urge the SEC to specify that companies do not have an obligation to describe with particularity in their reporting the details of any vulnerabilities in their systems that they reasonably believe could assist cyber attackers, or details of vulnerabilities in third party software that have not been disclosed by the third party software vendor.  ANY NEW RULE NEEDS TO INCLUDE EXCEPTIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT  The lack of an exception to allow delay of reporting of material incidents in cases where disclosure could negatively impact national security equities, or a law enforcement investigation could be detrimental to national security and law enforcement investigations against cyber attackers. Relatedly, we are concerned that in the rush to comply with a 4 business day reporting deadline, companies that have experienced cyber incidents impacting classified information may be put in an impossible situation of choosing between violating SEC disclosure obligation and violating criminal statutes, prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of classified information, given lack of time to properly vet and redact classified information from the disclosure in coordination with the government.  ISA suggests the Commission include a provision to allow delay of reporting of material incidents when the company has been informed by government authorities that a delay in disclosure would be in the interest of national security or an ongoing law enforcement investigation, and specifically clarify that companies do not have an obligation to describe with particularity in their reporting any information related to classified information, system, or programs.  18  ANY NEW RULES NEED TO BE UNAMBIGUOUS TO ASSURE THE CONSISTENCY THE COMMISSION DESIRES  The Commission correctly identifies regulatory inconsistency as a major problem; however, this inconsistency will likely be exacerbated under the proposed rule. Specifically, the SECs proposal to require companies to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed, individually immaterial, cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate, creates an exceptionally ambiguous standard. We believe this to be a highly subjective and potentially imprecise calculation that is practically unworkable. ISA suggests the Commission remove this proposed requirement. THE NEW SEC PROPOSED RULE WILL EXACERBATE THE CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF CYBERSECURITY RESOUCES  ISA is concerned that the SEC action will be adding another federal layer of federal regulation on top of what already exists, further complicating the already confused process of managing cyber risk. A GAO study last year documented that that complying with redundant and conflicting federal cyber regulations costs states and localities up to 70% of their meager cybersecurity budgets. This government study replicates the findings of previous research, which has found similar problems with duplicative and redundant regulation on the private sector. A 2022 study by ThoughtLabs found that 28% of the CISOs it surveyed reported that the increasing complexity of the varying cyber regulations itself is now among their greatest cyber risks, as it pulls scarce cyber resources into regulatory compliance activities when the organization needs them to be focused on security.  Requiring multiple, largely duplicative reports detracts from managing cyber risk. One fact virtually everyone in the cybersecurity space agrees on, both government and industry, is that we dont have nearly enough cybersecurity practitioners. The Bureau of Labor estimates that the current gap between cybersecurity jobs and qualified people is over 300,000 (some report this as closer to 600,000) and growing fast as attacks are rapidly mounting. As a result, it is 19  imperative that we use our scarce cybersecurity assets as efficiently and effectively as possible to mitigate risk. The NPRM itself notes that greater uniformity would be a positive step, however, the SEC doesnt need to expand its requirements in order to streamline them. Moreover, such uniformity is fleeting if it only applies to the SEC disclosures. The NPRM acknowledges that at least in some cases the Commissions new rules would conflict with some state cyber disclosure laws which grant exceptions to allow law enforcement to carry out criminal investigations. The Commission acknowledges this conflict but asserts that it is justified because the purpose of the two disclosures differs (investor information vs. law enforcement investigation). Although the Commission is correct that the purposes of the two provisions are distinct, that makes little difference to the entity that will still need to waste scarce cyber resources, to engage in the dual processes, to provide basically the same disclosure. Moreover, it is highly questionable that it is more important, on balance, to give a distinct set of investors timely information about one company than it is to aid law enforcement and, thus, protect all investors by potentially prosecuting cyber criminals and, thus, preventing many further attacks.  A sustainably secure cyber environment can only be accomplished by industry and government working in partnership. The additional tension that can be created through layering another administrative regulation, with the enforcement that will likely follow, is not in the spirit of needed cooperation.  It is notable that as the federal governments cybersecurity practices have matured, they have increasingly begun to move away from seeing industry as just a stake holder and view it more as a real partner. Government is probably more dependent on industry in this fight than the other way around and a great deal of effort has gone into creating an increasingly collaborative model. 20  Finally, ISA notes that the recently created Office of National Cybersecurity Director (ONCD) in the White House has been charged to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize federal incident reporting requirements, including those issued through regulations. ISA suggests the SEC communicate to the ONCD requesting they accelerate their streamlining process. The SEC should forestall implementing any new requirements in this area until the ONCD has completed its streamlining process allowing for a cohesive and efficient national policy on cyber incident reporting. THE SECS NEW PROPOSSED RULE COULD INCREASE STOCK MANIPULATION  There is also the very real possibility that the new rules would open the door to stock manipulation. The NPRM itself suggests the possibility of malicious actors, such as FIN4, may trade ahead of an incident disclosure to manipulate the market. The Commission argues the new rules will mitigate this risk by mandating that a disclosure be made no more than four days after a breach is judged by the company to be material. However, that analysis fails to appreciate the degree of control the attackers can have not only on when the attack occurs, but when it will be discovered and likely deemed material. Sophisticated breaches are very well concealed and often are not discovered for months after penetration. The Solar Winds breach was not discovered for at least nine months after the attack  and even then, the federal government had to be told it had been compromised (in nine different agencies) by a private company. Since the attacker has substantial control over the attacks and can often make the attack apparent at a time of their choosing thus starting the clock on the disclosure, they are not truly governed by the 4 day rule. Because cyber attackers are not governed by the rules of materiality, in most instances the attacker will have ample time before it is discovered and, during this time, it can carry on whatever manipulation, such as shorting stocks, it chooses. Sophisticated attackers will be able to time the disclosure by manipulating the attack to make it known to the victim when they desire. They will then have high confidence of the timing of the discovery and disclosure. If anything, the new rules would seem to provide an incentive for criminals to deliberately stage an attack on a company, after shorting the stock, thereby 21  triggering the disclosure so as to reap a benefit from the short. In fact, this new rule probably enables the attackers to carry out this scheme with far greater precision potentially shorting multiple companies. As such the Commissions new rule might actually enhance the opportunities for stock manipulation Unless fuller assurances can be provided that the new proposed rule will not enhance stock manipulation this risk alone strikes ISA as reason to forestall the rule in place and contemplate the other methods of disclosure we have suggested.  i Securities and Exchange Commission.

Countryman Secretary  100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File No. S7 09 22) Dear Ms. Countryman:  On March 9, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) issued a request for public comment soliciting input on the proposed rule regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure (the Proposing Release). FedEx Corporation (FedEx) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the Commissions request. FedEx is a global company that provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e commerce, and business services. Our annual revenues total approximately $92 billion, we have nearly 600,000 team members, and we serve customers in more than 220 countries and territories. Our common stock, of which nearly 260 million shares are outstanding, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We present our views from the perspective of a preparer of disclosures required to be filed with the Commission and as a large accelerated filer registered with the Commission. We commend the Commission for its recent efforts to review existing rules and regulations and consider updates when appropriate in light of the evolution of U.S. public markets. We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of our customers, vendors, and team members, and we deliver on this commitment by proactively ensuring a safe and secure online environment. Further, FedEx recognizes and appreciates the significance of critical cybersecurity practices and reporting material information about cybersecurity risks and incidents to investors in a timely manner. However, we are concerned that certain requirements in the Proposing Release raise significant concerns that must be addressed in any final rules adopted by the Commission. We appreciate that the Proposing Release would require disclosure only of material cyber events, and that the decision as to whether a triggering event has occurred is based on the well Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page 2  understood definition of materiality expressed by the Supreme Court.1 However, we are concerned that a hard and fast rule requiring disclosure of any material cyber event within four business days of an issuers materiality determination, with no exceptions, is unworkable. In the event of a cyber incident, issuers work closely with federal and state regulatory agencies to identify the perpetrators and prevent future cyber incidents. For example, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) requires that companies make confidential filings, which enable CISA to assist in mitigating an ongoing cybersecurity incident. The Proposing Release would require disclosure even if the issuer has been informed by governmental authorities that delay of disclosure at that time would be in the interest of national security and/or that disclosure at that time would hinder law enforcement efforts to identify or capture the threat actor. FedEx appreciates the importance of timely and comparable public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents. However, we do not believe the Proposing Release fully accounts for the appropriate balancing of these significant interests, which would place issuers in an untenable situation of potentially impeding matters of national security and/or law enforcement efforts while complying with public disclosure requirements. Additionally, the inflexibility of the disclosure requirements under the Proposing Release may result in harm to investor interests in such situations. Accordingly, it is important that the final rule include an exception for instances where public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents would conflict with national security and/or would hinder law enforcement efforts in connection with a cybersecurity incident. Such an exception will provide issuers with the necessary flexibility to delay public disclosure in such situations and ensure public disclosure requirements account for existing confidential reporting frameworks and law enforcement investigations, thus helping to protect companies, investors, and the United States from increased cybersecurity risks. As stated above, FedEx appreciates that the Proposing Release would require disclosure only of material cybersecurity incidents. However, we view the requirement to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate as burdensome and unnecessary. The requirement would result in disjointed and potentially imprecise assessments regarding whether cybersecurity incidents are related, especially in light of the scope and volume of highly immaterial cybersecurity incidents experienced by companies each day. As such, the requirement would impose increased costs on companies to make disclosures without a corresponding increase in the likelihood of producing decision useful information for investors.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The American Chemistry Council (ACC) submits these comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to the proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. The proposed revisions to the 2018 reporting requirements have significant potential major impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and corporate governance programs.  ACC, in its letter dated May 2, 2022, urged the SEC to extend the comment period by an additional 30 days. The SEC did not approve this request. With the denial, ACC will not respond to the individual questions posed by the SEC in its current request, but the underlying reasons for the request remain:  The proposed amendments to the 2018 reporting requirements have significant potential major impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and corporate governance programs.  Identifying issues and preparing comments to respond to 40 or so questions require considerable thought and resources to prepare useful responses. In addition, we note that the SEC is proposing several other significant notification rules, i.e., climate change, which have overlapping comment periods.  SECs proposed revisions would require near real time and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity incidents. The SEC proposal also requires companies to disclose procedures to address cyber risk, managements role, and expertise in implementing a cyber protection program, and disclosure of the companys board of directors role and expertise on cybersecurity. The information on material cyber incidents would be reported on Form 8 K.  ACC believes the SECs 2018 guidance to publicly traded companies is sufficient in providing information on cybersecurity reporting obligations and provides information that informs investors. As proposed, SECs cyber incident disclosure revisions could expose a  americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  companys security resilience procedures to cyber hackers. Materiality determinations are emphasized over cybersecurity risks.  ACC, through its Responsible Care program, CFATs risk management and reporting requirements, and voluntary cyber risk management initiatives, emphasizes tiered risk management approaches to developing, maintaining, auditing, and revising cyber protection programs. The NIST cyber framework and industry standards and guidelines help form the foundation for these programs. SECs proposal would shift the focus to compliance based reporting rather than the more appropriate focus on managing cyber risks and identifying and resolving cyber incidents.  The SEC proposal was drafted without the consideration of the cyber incident reporting requirements of other federal agencies and the newly enacted cyber incident reporting legislation. ACC members are subject to cyber related rules required by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, the Transportation Security Agency, the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others, depending on the companys scope of activities. Rather than creating additional and potentially conflicting cyber incident reporting requirements, the SEC should coordinate with other federal agencies to harmonize reporting requirements. SECs current proposals could potentially interfere with law enforcement investigations of cyber crimes by diverting corporate and law enforcement resources from investigating and resolving significant cyber incidents.  SEC proposed to amend Form 8 K to require a company to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within 4 business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The SEC argues that such reporting would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures.  Specifically, a company would be required to disclose the following information about a material cybersecurity incident at the time of the Form 8 K filing—  o When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing. o A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident. o Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose. o The effect of the incident on the registrants operations. o Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.  The disclosure requirement of 4 business days could require a company to report while the incident is still ongoing and being managed by the company and/or law enforcement. This could potentially provide attackers with additional information over company cyber defenses.  Companies will have to determine whether a disclosure to SEC would negatively impact its cyber defense program and whether releasing security program information that is considered  americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  confidential by the company will increase its risk to cyber attacks. If companies are required to report detailed information, the disclosure could provide a roadmap to vulnerabilities if malicious actors detected patterns.  Subject to a CISA rulemaking, the new cyber incident reporting legislation (CIRCIA) requires certain owners and/or operators of critical infrastructure to report covered cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours. CIRCIAs 72 hour window compares roughly equally to the Commissions proposed Form 8 K requirement, which stipulates that a company must disclose a material cybersecurity incident to the SEC within 4 business days. However, the SEC does not allow for temporary delays in reporting that may be due to internal investigation of the incident or external investigation, including efforts by law enforcement. Companies should not be required to report if it may compromise an ongoing investigation. The SEC should urge companies to work with law enforcement to mitigate cyber incidents, rather than disclose potentially inaccurate information within 4 business days.  ACC members frequently hear from the FBI and DHS/CISA that notifying them is key toward mitigating cybersecurity incidents. Authorities can often figure out the details of a cybersecurity incident—the what, the when, and the how—as the incident moves forward, but the advantages of time and dialogue are important. Companies need time, potentially more than a few business days, to provide law enforcement with key information. The SEC reporting time requirement could undermine the public/private collaboration. Where a federal regulation exists, the SEC should reconsider its position on exemptions and incorporate into its proposed rule an exemption for entities that are subject to and in compliance with similar federal reporting regulations. The SEC also proposes that companies disclose when a series of undisclosed individual immaterial cyber incidents become material in the aggregate. ACC believes that further guidance is required to determine when a series of incidents become material. Potential material incidents would be difficult to track over an undefined period.  SECs proposal requires companies to disclose policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. Providing all the information required in this proposal (a detailed description of its cyber risk management program) could compromise a companys ability to defend against future cyber attacks. The SEC has not described why such a level of detail would benefit investors or that the benefits would outweigh the potential consequences to companies that are already victims of cybercriminals or nation state actors.  DHS administered regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information include the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program and the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). CFATS information is safeguarded as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information, and MTSA information is safeguarded as sensitive security information. The SECs proposed amendments are clearly at odds with the determination of   americanchemistry.com® 700 Second St., NE | Washington, DC 20002 | (202) 249.7000  DHS that information about cybersecurity incidents must be kept confidential and not publicly disclosed.  This SEC proposal also requires disclosure of a companys cybersecurity governance, including Board oversight of cybersecurity risk and a description of managements role in assessing and managing cyber risks. The proposal would require companies to disclose whether they have a chief information security officer (CISO), his or her relevant expertise, and where the CISO fits in the entitys organization. The proposal would also require disclosures about the interactions of management and the board on cybersecurity, including the frequency with which the board and management considers cybersecurity risk and related topics. In addition, SECs proposal says. If any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.  ACC believes these proposed requirements dictate that companies take specific cybersecurity actions that are not promoting sound cyber risk management practices and puts the SEC in the position to dictate how companies operate their cybersecurity protection programs.  ACC also objects to disclosing the names of board members with cybersecurity expertise. The SEC should not have any influence on which experts sit on a companys governing body.  Cybersecurity talent is hard to find. From a personnel standpoint, its unclear where companies would get the so called cybersecurity expertise that the proposed regulation would mandate. There is a well known lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors. In any case, the SEC has not justified that having cybersecurity experts on boards would benefit its cybersecurity protection program. Similarly, investors may see the inclusion of certain individuals on a companys board as an indication of a companys overall cybersecurity program maturity and as a sign that a company is more secure than another one. Such an outcome could be misleading.  In summary, ACC urges the SEC to significantly revise this proposed rule or maintain the 2018 interpretive guidance.

Countryman Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street, NE  Washington, DC 20549 1090 [Submitted via email to rule comments@sec.gov] Dear Ms. Countryman: Re: File Number S7 09 22: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure BuildingCyberSecurity.org1 (BCS) is a global non profit organization established in 2020 to establish and sustain cyber protection performance frameworks developed by stakeholders across multiple sectors offering market driven options and insurance incentives to mitigate cyber risk in connected networks, controls, and devices in an increasingly smart world. The BCS framework is improving human safety globally by incentivizing investments in protected operational technologies (OT), related information technology (IT) networks, processes, training, and recovery plans to enhance the security of cyber physical systems against rapidly evolving threats in technologically advancing societies. The BCS framework is being used by asset owners and insurers to assess cyber related exposure, and to certify various levels of continuous monitoring, validation, and improvement of cyber protections to respond to a rapidly evolving threat based on a companys internal risk management framework. Our goal is to offer companies a return on cyber protection investments to mitigate risk by favorable consideration in the development of insurance policy terms for a wide range of risk transfer instruments (cyber, property, casualty, directors/officers, technical omissions, etc)  BCS represents a broad group of private and public stakeholders, including cyber security experts, system manufacturers and integrators, asset owners/managers, cyber security companies, insurers, designers, and engineering companies committed to a comprehensive IT and OT cyber protections in a framework that will consistently evolve and mature to meet rapidly moving cyber threats. A private sector framework bases on industry best practices is more responsive, flexible, and effective that government standards that lag 2 4 years behind the threat.  Perspective on the Proposal BCS strongly supports adoption of Item 106(b) and (c). Publicly traded companies face an unprecedented existential threat where asset or brand value, business operations, reputation and safety for employees and customers can be threatened or disrupted with one keystroke in a matter of minutes. The billions of cyber attack vectors from Nation States and terrorist organizations to criminal actors, cyber hackers, and even disgruntled employees or customers present an overwhelming risk for most companies relying on the internet, networks or connected  1 https://buildingcybersecurity.org/ Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May __, 2022 Page 2  2  devices and infrastructure for their revenue. The SEC must take action now to raise the priority of remedies and investments to protect operations. Requested input is submitted as follows: Input to question 16 Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? BCS strongly recommends the study and inclusion of the need to cite or measure cyber performance against a standard reference architecture or framework to allow registrants to qualify the efficacy and implementation of their policies, including the use of third party assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program. Existence of a cyber program is not as important to investors/shareholders as its performance. Asking a registrant to report the existence and brief description of a cyber security program without a national framework or reference architecture results in management and boards of directors guessing at effective or reasonable strategies to address cybersecurity risks. This concern is the source of lawsuits where business disruptions have resulted in significant economic loss. Defendant disregarded the rights of Plaintiff and Class Members by intentionally, willfully, recklessly, or negligently failing to take and implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the Pipelines critical infrastructure was safeguarded, 2 Many industries already have specific regulations for cyber security programs and metrics. An example would be Critical Infrastructure Protection standards for utilities developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a non profit body created and funded by the utilities themselves and subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States governments regulatory entity for energy. Other industries are developing new cyber guidance through trade associations or other organizations. Certain industries rely on meeting federal standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). BCS has developed a framework of protections for the commercial real estate industry. Bottom line, investors must be able to assess a registrants cyber programs and governance against what has been adopted as a reasonable standard for their industry.  In addition, in a connected, smart society, cyber threats are constantly evolving, metastasizing, and expanding with millions of new attack vectors added each day. We recommend that Item 6 include a description how a companys policies and governance assess the reasonable future likelihood and impact to the registrants results of operations or financial condition with intelligence or updated information on emerging cyber methods and trends. Boards can no longer rely on static audits conducted annually to assess cyber risk. Dynamic real time monitoring, feedback, and security actions at the speed of relevance within a performance framework will be more effective for companies to mitigate future risk.  Input to question 19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would better define cybersecurity?  2 https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit settlements/money/colonial pipeline says it has no obligation to reimburse consumers after ransomware attack/ Ms. Vanessa A. Countryman May __, 2022 Page 3  3  BCS believes adopting a definition for cybersecurity in Item 106(a) would be helpful for corporate boards to establish a standard understanding of the risk across all functions of a company in order to determine the cyber expertise required on the Board. BCS defines cybersecurity as any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address an attempt to gain unauthorized access to, and exploit software or hardware for purposes other than intended by the owner, and to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and operations. In this definition, BCS specifically addresses hardware (microchips, process logical controllers, sensors, industrial controls systems, operational technologies, smart devices, etc) as a distinct cyber security concern for companies and shareholders. A cyber attack on hardware for a company would have different effects, including threats to human safety, health, and property or in certain cases, a threat to the essential services society relies on for existence. A perfect example would be the ransomware attack in May 2021 on the Colonial pipeline, which quickly escalated from a seizure/encryption of data systems to the closure of part of the east coast fuel supply due to concerns about migration of the attack into OT systems and the severing of automated smart meters from the IT systems that had been seized. For publicly traded companies which rely on connected or automated OT for asset or operational performance (commercial real estate, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, robotics, critical infrastructure, etc), a threat to those systems would have an immediate and asymmetrical impact on a companys value.  The President of the United States, with the support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has published numerous National Security memorandum3, alerts4, and guidance5 in the last year specifically addressing the unique risk in cyber physical systems. (CPS). We recommend that disclosure of policies and procedures, to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats, include governance, policies and procedures, or technologies to mitigate physical or other harm to employees or customers, reinforcing the determination by federal agencies of the unique cyber risk to human safety.  Input to question 20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors?  BCS experts contend that specifying the cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service, internal or external, may create more harm than good. Instead, investors would benefit more from knowing the benchmarked results of the actions measuring investments and outcomes to mitigate cyber risk against a national reference architecture, standard, or industry developed framework.

We stand ready to work directly with the Commission as it moves forward to develop a clear, transparent, and effective set of cybersecurity disclosure rules.

Countryman, Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 Dear Ms. Countryman: xSRL us 1211 Avenue of the Americas 19th Floor New York, NY 10036 Phone: (202) 448 1985 Fax: (866) 516 6923 RE: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File Number S? 09 22 Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposal on Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. We appreciate the importance of timely monitoring of cybersecurity incidents that could adversely impact an individual company or industry, for investors tracking investment performance, and for regulators identifying and monitoring potential systemic risks caused by cybersecurity incidents. We support the requirement in the proposal that cybersecurity incident data be reported in lnline XBRL format to enhance the timeliness and granularity of data reported, and to allow consistent tracking of such incidents over time. Capturing this information in machine readable format will ensure that cybersecurity information is more readily available, accessible, and comparable. XBRL US is a nonprofit standards organization, with a mission to improve the efficiency and quality of reporting in the U.S. by promoting the adoption of business reporting standards. XBRL US is a jurisdiction of XBRL International, the nonprofit consortium responsible for developing and maintaining the technical specification for XBRL. XBRL is a free and open data standard widely used in the United States, and around the world, for reporting by public and private companies, as well as government agencies. As a standards organization we have assisted in the development of taxonomies that are used today by U.S. entities reporting to regulators including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the SEC itself. Developing effective standards that support market participants requires collaborating with all stakeholders along the supply chain, from reporting entities to data collectors to data users. Given the importance of cybersecurity data, we plan to convene a working group to prepare a prototype taxonomy of cybersecurity incident data which may be of assistance to the Commission as it works towards finalizing this rule. This letter provides responses to specific questions raised in the SEC proposal: Proposal Question 1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?  Page 2 of 3  We agree that investors would benefit from timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K, and we recommend that the Commission require that the cover pages of Form 8 Ks published about cybersecurity incidents be XBRL tagged, as are other Form 8 Ks prepared by public companies. We also suggest that the Item numbers on Form 8 Ks be tagged as well to alert investors that a cybersecurity incident has been reported. This would allow investors and other users to easily identify the topic of a Form 8 K which would help in analysis. Proposal Question 9. Should certain registrants that would be within the scope of the proposed requirements, but that are subject to other cybersecurity related regulations, or that would be included in the scope of the Commissions recently proposed cybersecurity rules for advisers and funds, if adopted, be excluded from the proposed requirements? For example, should the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirements or the other disclosure requirements described in this release, as applicable, exclude business development companies (BDCs),or the publicly traded parent of an adviser?  All registrants should be required to report in the same way for ease of data use and comparability. The ability to capture all cybersecurity incidents in the same fashion would facilitate understanding trends across market participants, and eliminate the need for data users to cobble together information from multiple data sources prepared in different formats. It would allow data users to collect data from different reporting entities using the same application and commingle the data in the same data store. Proposal Question 40. Should we require registrants to tag the disclosures required by proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S K in Inline XBRL, as proposed? Are there any changes we should make to ensure accurate and consistent tagging? If so, what changes should we make? Should we require registrants to use a different structured data language to tag these disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require? Are there any registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs that we should exempt from the tagging requirement? We agree with the proposal to require Inline XBRL formatting for both text block tagging of narrative and detail tagging of quantitative disclosures. Taking a different structured data approach such as developing a custom XML schema, would result in added costs for all stakeholders, reduced efficiencies in adapting to changes, and the inability to commingle data sets such as financial performance and cybersecurity incident data. Adopting an Inline XBRL approach is most efficient as the data will be rendered in both human and machine readable format. Most reporting entities today are familiar with preparing their data in Inline XBRL so the added cost will be minimized. Data users are accustomed to extracting and analyzing data in Inline XBRL format. Adopting a widely used standard will limit costs for all stakeholders. To ensure consistent, accurate tagging, we urge the Commission to provide detailed, concrete guidance on the tagging process, as well as early access to a draft taxonomy, sample Inline XBRL I •1 reports and technical guidance, along with the ability to test file in an EDGAR Beta test environment prior to compliance date. Ideally, we ask for a 12 15 month window for testing, with materials as noted above available from the start. Taking these steps will help filers and the providers who work with them to implement the rule successfully and efficiently. Proposal Question: Evaluate whether the Commissions estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information are accurate. We agree with the Commissions assertion that the cost of XBRL formatting will be minimal due to the fact that most filers already comply with XBRL reporting requirements and therefore have the process and applications in place to facilitate the process. Tagging additional cybersecurity incident disclosures will be incremental to their current workflow. We appreciate the opportunity to provide input to the Commissions proposal on cybersecurity. As noted above, we will report back to the Commission once we have a draft set of standards developed for cybersecurity incidents developed in a working group by collaborating with various market participants.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  RE: File Number S7 09 22  Dear Ms. Countryman:  We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or the Commission) proposed rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. We are pleased to provide our perspectives on this important topic, which CEOs cited as the greatest threat to their companies in PwCs Global CEO Survey released in January 2022. Overall, we support enhanced disclosure related to cybersecurity risk and the Commissions efforts to standardize cybersecurity disclosures for all public companies. We recognize the importance of a registrants obligation to provide its investors with timely, accurate, and decision useful information on cybersecurity. Although we are supportive of the proposed rules, we offer recommendations in the appendix that we believe will clarify the requirements and make the rules more operational for registrants while still meeting the needs of investors. Our intent in providing these recommendations is to balance the need to provide timely, decision useful information to investors, while also mitigating a registrants exposure to risk from bad actors. * * * * *  The appendix includes our detailed recommendations, organized by section. We would be pleased to discuss our comments or answer any specific questions that the Commission or its staff may have. Please contact Mary Grace Davenport at  or Heather Horn at regarding our submission.  Sincerely,  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP A1 Appendix Section B: Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K  We agree with the proposed requirement to disclose material cybersecurity incidents. Limiting disclosures to information that is material per the securities laws helps disclosure remain relevant for investors. Under the SECs Division of Corporation Finances current interpretive guidance, registrants already assess the materiality of cybersecurity incidents for disclosure and should have effective policies and procedures established to do so. We note that completing a materiality determination could take several weeks to months from initial identification of an incident, depending on its complexity. Thus, we support the requirement to determine that an incident is material as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, we agree with the proposed limited safe harbor with regard to the consequences of an untimely Form 8 K filing under proposed Item 1.05. The proposed rule would require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents even if a government, a government agency, or law enforcement has instructed the registrant not to disclose the information for a period of time. We believe governmental prohibitions on disclosure should take precedence. As such, we recommend that the Commission modify the proposed rule to require disclosure on Form 8 K the later of four business days after determining the incident is material and the date disclosure is no longer restricted by a government or agency. Given the proposed time frame for disclosure, some information may be incomplete or unavailable. In particular, it may be harder to compile information about third party resources (which would be included in the disclosure requirements based on the proposed definition of information system). We acknowledge that the registrants responsibility for the cybersecurity of its operations extends to systems it uses but does not own. However, because of the possible difficulty in obtaining information from a third party because of an unwillingness to share information before an investigation is finalized or a limitation on contractual rights, the related Form 8 K may be filed with less detail than if the system were owned. We believe, however, that even limited information, filed in a timely manner, will be useful to investors. We also agree with the proposed safe harbor for registrants who may be unable to include all of the required disclosures in the Form 8 K at the time of filing.  Some of the information required to be disclosed, such as whether the incident has been remediated, could subject the registrant to increased cybersecurity risk. When a particular incident is resolved, disclosing that remediation of that incident is complete may suggest that the risk itself is resolved when, in reality, companies are continuously improving their security posture and adjusting to changes in the threat landscape. At the same time, disclosing that remediation is in process or has not yet begun suggests that the company may still be vulnerable to some of the underlying aspects of the attack. Although the proposal indicates that the Commission would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident, even a lack of disclosure on this point may provide bad actors with too much information, inviting additional breaches. As a result, we recommend removing remediation from the list of required disclosures.  We note that some cybersecurity incidents result in loss of assets, often made possible by unauthorized access to information. However, the proposed requirements do not explicitly address including asset loss in the disclosure. We recommend that the disclosure of the nature and scope of the incident include whether any cash, securities, inventory, or other tangible or intangible assets were lost as a result of the incident.   A2  Section C: Disclosure about Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports  C1  Updates to Previously Filed Form 8 K Disclosure  We support the proposals requirement to provide material updates to cyber incident information included in a Form 8 K in subsequent Forms 10 Q or 10 K. However, the proposed rules are unclear regarding the registrants obligation to file an amended Form 8 K. Clarity on when the registrant would be obligated to amend the Form 8 K would ensure registrants comply with the disclosure requirements and help management consider the implications of possessing material nonpublic information as it pertains to insider trading protocols.  We also observe that proposed Item 106(d)(1) of Regulation S K would require a registrant to include in its update of prior incident disclosures, as applicable, a description of the potential material future impact of the incident on operations and financial condition. This provision is vague, and it is unclear how a registrant would determine if there is a potential material future impact. We recommend removing this example from the list of matters that should be addressed.  C2  Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material in the Aggregate  The proposing release refers to the need to analyze related cybersecurity incidents and consider them for disclosure when they become material in the aggregate. We agree that there may be times when a series of incidents should be reported together because they are collectively material. We note, however, that proposed rule 229.106(d)(2) refers only to the need to aggregate a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents. We recommend that the final rules make it clear that only related incidents need to be considered when assessing whether they are material in the aggregate. We do not support the aggregation of different types of incidents; it would be challenging and perhaps not operationally feasible since:  • materiality assessments may vary by incident type, • it would be challenging to provide clear and comparable disclosures of aggregate incidents without common underlying characteristics, and • if the incidents are unrelated, the registrant would be disclosing (and updating) specifics on remediation of individually immaterial items.  As there is no guidance provided in the proposed rule on how to aggregate previously undisclosed related incidents, we recommend that the Commission include principles based guidance to help ensure consistency in application. The guidance should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the myriad of cybersecurity incidents that registrants of different sizes and sophistication and across different industries would need to consider, but set an appropriately high bar for when incidents need to be considered in the aggregate. Such aggregation guidance could be similar to that used to aggregate deficiencies in audits of ICFR. For example, when determining whether to aggregate deficiencies related to cybersecurity, management often considers the nature of the incidents and the systems impacted, as well as the interaction of systems and entry points and whether the incidents are addressed by the same remediation. Additional guidance regarding the time period over which incidents should be aggregated would also be helpful for consistent application. Any guidance issued by the SEC should allow for management to exercise well reasoned judgment regarding which incidents should be aggregated.   A3  Section D: Disclosure of a Registrants Risk Management, Strategy and Governance Regarding Cybersecurity Risks  D1  Risk Management and Strategy  We support disclosure of a registrants risk management policies and strategy pertaining to cybersecurity, and agree that cybersecurity risks may have an impact on a registrants business strategy, financial outlook, or financial planning. However, we believe these disclosures, like all disclosures, should be rooted in materiality. As proposed, registrants would need to disclose whether cybersecurity related risk and incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to affect the registrants results of operations or financial condition and if so, how. There does not appear to be an explicit materiality qualification in this proposed requirement. We recommend that the proposed rule refer instead to cyber incidents that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition. We agree with the proposed disclosure of whether the registrant has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third party service provider. We note that one way for companies to assess and monitor third party providers is by obtaining reports from licensed CPA firms who can provide assurance about the third partys cybersecurity controls and disclosures.1  D2  Governance  Under the proposed rules, registrants would be required to disclose information about their boards oversight of cybersecurity risk. We agree that understanding how the board oversees this risk in particular is important. We believe, however, that there is value in co locating all governance related disclosures. Item 407(h) of Regulation S K requires a description of the extent of the boards role in the risk oversight of the registrant, such as how the board administers its oversight function. We would support amendments to Item 407 to require that the detail of the boards oversight include a discussion of how it oversees cybersecurity risk.  D3  Definitions  We recommend that the Commission align its definition of a cybersecurity incident with the definition used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which defines a cybersecurity incident as a cybersecurity event that has been determined to have an impact on the organization prompting the need for response and recovery. NIST separately defines a cybersecurity event as a cybersecurity change that may have an impact on organizational operations (including mission, capabilities, or reputation). We believe utilizing an existing, widely used, and commonly understood definition is preferable to creating an alternate SEC specific definition.  If the Commission elects to retain a separate definition, we recommend that the definition be modified to make clear that a cybersecurity incident requiring disclosure should be an actual breach (i.e., a system was actually exploited versus jeopardized). Section G: Structured Data Requirements  We support the proposal to require block text and detailed tagging of the narrative and quantitative disclosures required by the proposal using Inline XBRL. The provision of structured data will make this information more easily accessible for purposes of aggregation, comparison, and other filtering by investors and other market participants. 1  The AICPAs cybersecurity reporting framework may provide suitable criteria to be used in evaluating cybersecurity at service providers.",2

May 9, 2022 Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File No. S7 09 22) Dear Ms. Countryman: We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the recently proposed rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529; File No. S7 09 22) (the Proposed Rules). BCE Inc. (BCE), Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI) and TELUS Corporation (TELUS) are Canadian corporations and are the largest communications service providers in Canada. BCE, RCI and TELUS are also foreign private issuers (FPIs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to U.S. periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Further, BCE, RCI and TELUS are participants in the SECs multijurisdictional disclosure system (MJDS) for Canadian issuers, which allows eligible Canadian issuers, such as BCE, RCI and TELUS, to register securities under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and to register securities and satisfy their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act by use of documents prepared largely in accordance with Canadian requirements. As MJDS registrants, BCE, RCI and TELUS satisfy their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act by filing their respective annual reports on Form 40 F and other documents under cover of Form 6 K. We note that the Proposed Rules did not contemplate any amendments to the current Form 40 F disclosure requirements. In its release, the SEC acknowledged that the MJDS generally permits eligible Canadian FPIs to use Canadian disclosure standards and BCE Inc. 1 Carrefour Alexander Graham Bell Building A, 7th Floor Verdun, Québec H3E 3B3 Canada Rogers Communications Inc. 333 Bloor Street East, 7th Floor Toronto ON M4W 1G9 Canada TELUS Corporation 510 Georgia Street West  Vancouver BC V6B 0M3 Canada U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  2 documents to satisfy the SECs registration and disclosure requirements. However, the SEC specifically requested comment on whether MJDS registrants should be required to include the same cybersecurity disclosures in their annual reports on Form 40 F as would be required for U.S. domestic registrants for their annual reports on Form 10 K or other FPIs for their annual reports on Form 20 F. Since the adoption by the SEC of the MJDS, MJDS registrants have been deemed to comply with the requirements of Regulation 13A pursuant to Rule 13a 3 (§ 240.13a 3 (Reporting by Form 40 F Registrant)). Rule 13a 3 has been effective since July 1, 1991 and was adopted in connection with the implementation of the MJDS framework. Rule 13a 3 specifies that [a] registrant that is eligible to use Forms 40 F and 6 K and files reports in accordance therewith shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of Regulation 13A (§§ 240.13a 1 through 240.13a 17 of this chapter). The SECs regulations would otherwise require MJDS registrants to comply with the SECs prescriptive disclosure requirements in accordance with the applicable SECs form requirements (e.g., annual reports on Form 20 F for FPIs). The SEC noted in its decision to adopt MJDS that: Canada was chosen as the first partner for the United States in part because of the similarities between the U.S. and Canadian investor protection mandates and disclosure requirements. The existence of a well developed, sophisticated and reliable system of administering Canadian disclosure requirements also was critical, given the Commissions reliance on Canadian definitions, procedures, application of disclosure standards, and day to day administration of those standards.1 The MJDS framework appropriately treats the Canadian reporting framework as substantially equivalent to that of the SEC, avoids duplicative and overlapping reporting obligations, and acknowledges that Canadian reporting requirements are sufficient for investors in the United States. We note that MJDS forms will continue to specify that an MJDS registrant must include information in its filings such that its disclosures do not contain material misstatements or omissions.2 We therefore believe the existing disclosure framework for MJDS registrants is sufficient to inform U.S. investors of material cybersecurity incidents. Accordingly, we strongly support the SECs approach of not amending Form 40 F in the Proposed Rules,3 since imposing prescriptive reporting requirements on MJDS registrants 1 SEC Release No. 33 6879, 55 Fed. Reg. 46,288, 46,288 89 (Nov. 2, 1990). 2 See, e.g., General Instruction D(5) to Form 40 F (specifying that Rule 12b 20 under the Exchange Act applies for reports filed on such form). 3 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590 (Mar. 23, 2022) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 229, 232, 239, 240, and 249), at 16603 (We are not U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  3 with respect to cybersecurity topics would be completely inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the MJDS. Extending these new cybersecurity disclosure requirements to MJDS registrants would result in an unnecessary and inefficient incremental burden for registrants already subject to a robust reporting regime in Canada, exactly the situation that MJDS was designed to avoid. Consistent with the SECs existing approach to disclosure requirements, we support excluding MJDS registrants from the new annual reporting requirements under the Proposed Rules. MJDS registrants would continue to file annual reports on Form 40 F consistent with past practice and furnish information on Form 6 K to the extent required under the existing MJDS disclosure framework. We note that Canadian securities regulators have been focused on cybersecurity disclosures for a number of years. For example, the Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA) identified cybersecurity as a priority area in the CSAs 2016 19 Business Plan. The CSA has since issued extensive guidance on disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management practices of Canadian reporting companies and published numerous notices highlighting the importance of cybersecurity to Canadian financial markets and the need for prevention, coordination and remediation plans.4 We understand that cybersecurity matters continue to be an active priority for the CSA5 and that the members of the CSA consider cybersecurity matters as part of their ongoing continuous disclosure reviews applicable to Canadian issuers. We therefore believe the existing disclosure framework for MJDS registrants is sufficient to inform U.S. investors of material cybersecurity incidents. Finally, we wanted to express a specific concern with the current scope of the Proposed Rules. We understand that, for U.S. domestic registrants, the Proposed Rules would impose prescriptive requirements for the timing and content of disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, and additional disclosure requirements, without regard for the security risks and harms that such disclosures may pose in certain circumstances. We (like many other companies) rely on a variety of third party IT products and services which may be provided by U.S. domestic registrants. In our view, no registrant should be required to disclose an ongoing or unremediated incident, and periodic disclosures should proposing any changes to Form 40 F. Should we instead require an MJDS issuer filing an annual report on Form 40 F to comply with the Commissions specific proposed cybersecurity related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10 K or Form 20 F filers?).  4 See, e.g., CSA Staff Notice 11 326, Cyber Security (September 26, 2013); CSA Staff Notice 11 332, Cyber Security (September 27, 2016); CSA Multilateral Staff Notice 51 347, Disclosure of cyber security risks and incidents (January 19, 2017); CSA Staff Notice 11 336, Summary of CSA Roundtable on Response to Cyber Security Incidents (April 6, 2017); CSA Staff Notice 11 338, CSA Market Disruption Coordination Plan (October 18, 2018). 5 See, e.g., CSA Interim Progress Report 2021 and OSC Business Plan for the fiscal years ending 2023 2025. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  4 not require registrants to disclose progress in remediation or the nature of remediation activities, where such disclosures may harm the registrant or its customers, or conflict with the requests of law enforcement officials. Requiring registrants to disclose ongoing and unremediated incidents or the nature and progress of remediation activities may allow the original malicious actors to engage in techniques to hide their presence in the work, making it difficult to detect them, and allow the original malicious actors or others to exploit the IT product or service provider further and attack its customers. This increases the likelihood that we or other similarly situated customers could experience material cybersecurity incidents as a direct result of the disclosure of an ongoing and unremediated incident or disclosure of the nature and progress of remediation activities.  This result is not in the interests of the affected registrants, their shareholders or their customers (such as BCE, RCI and TELUS). * * * We thank you for the opportunity to provide our views on the Proposed Rules. In response to the SECs request for comment, we confirm that no prescriptive cybersecurity disclosure requirements should be required for MJDS registrants filing their annual reports on Form 40 F.

(Enbridge) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) in response to the Commissions request for public input on the Commissions proposed rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure1 (the Proposed Rules). Enbridge is a leading North American energy infrastructure company with common shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. We safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want to fuel quality of life. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, our core businesses include Liquids Pipelines, which transports approximately 30 percent of the crude oil produced in North America; Gas Transmission and Midstream, which transports approximately 20 percent of the natural gas consumed in the U.S.; Gas Distribution and Storage, which serves approximately 3.9 million retail customers in Ontario and Quebec; and Renewable Power Generation, which owns approximately 1,766 MW (net) in renewable power generation capacity in North America and Europe. We believe that cybersecurity attacks can have serious effects on critical infrastructure and national security, with the potential for systemic effects on the economy as a whole. This is a widely shared concern, and as the Commission will be aware, other government agencies have also taken action in response to this risk, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). At Enbridge, safety is a core value and a top priority. As an owner and operator of critical energy infrastructure, cybersecurity is an important risk consideration for Enbridge. Enbridge plays a critical role in enabling the economic well being and quality of life of North Americans who depend on access to reliable energy. We are keenly aware that any interruptions in our business could impact energy supply to North Americans. We believe the detailed disclosures that would be required under the Proposed Rules could give malicious threat actors valuable insights into a companys cybersecurity posture, with the unintended result of making the company more vulnerable to cyber attacks. If the disclosure requirements are too extensive, they may exceed the Commissions rulemaking authority and not survive legal challenges. We urge the Commission to carefully balance its investor protection policy goals against the harm of increased cybersecurity risks. It is in that spirit that Enbridge offers the following comments for consideration. 1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf 2 Material Cybersecurity Incident Disclosure and Updated Incident Disclosure Materiality Enbridge strongly believes that any Commission guidance or rulemaking regarding cybersecurity disclosure must support its statutory mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.2 Enbridge recognizes that material cybersecurity risks have become increasingly important to investors and other stakeholders. As the Commission has noted, public companies are already subject to disclosure requirements that include material cybersecurity risks and incidents.3 We believe that the concept of materiality is critical to maintain in any disclosure rules and guidance that the Commission chooses to implement. We believe further that companies are best positioned to determine which occurrences constitute material cybersecurity incidents for their business, and which details regarding these incidents or the companys cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance are material. We urge the Commission not to require disclosure of immaterial information that may not be decision useful to investors, but that may pose a significant reporting burden on companies and expose them to greater risk of cyber attack. Definition of Cybersecurity Incident We believe the Proposed Rules define cybersecurity incident4 too broadly, particularly when this term and the included term information systems are construed broadly. We believe companies are best positioned to determine what constitutes a cybersecurity incident for their business and that it is impractical and unduly burdensome to define cybersecurity incident to include occurrences that have had no adverse impact on a companys business, financial condition or results or operations. Companies would be required to consider in their disclosure processes a substantial number of occurrences that they may consider to be neither cybersecurity incidents nor material. For example, an unauthorized occurrence could potentially include a breach of a technology, records or security policy by an employee or service provider, such as leaving a file cabinet unlocked in an office. The definition includes the mere jeopardizing, as opposed to actually having an impact on, information systems or information. The reference to any information residing therein  potentially includes vast amounts of information. Individually Immaterial Cybersecurity Incidents The Proposed Rules would require periodic reporting when a series of previously undisclosed, individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become material in the aggregate, including the effect on the registrants operations and incident remediation status. We are concerned about the potential for disclosure of immaterial information under this proposed requirement and respectfully request that the Commission consider eliminating it. If the Commission maintains this proposed requirement, we urge the Commission to provide more guidance. In the context of the digitalization of business operations and rapidly increasing prevalence of cyber attacks in the ordinary course of business, we believe it is difficult and operationally  2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: SEC.gov | About the SEC. 3 See supra note 1 at p. 12 17 and Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Release No. 33 10459, available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf. 4 See supra note 1 at p. 41: Cybersecurity incident means an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information system or any information residing therein and Information systems means information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations. 3 challenging to define what is material in the aggregate when considering the number and types of cyber attacks and cyber attackers over an indefinite period of time. We believe additional guidance could help ensure disclosure of material information in a manner that is decision useful to investors and operationally feasible for companies.  Security Concerns The U.S. federal government has identified critical infrastructure sectors whose operation is vital to national security, public health and safety5 and, in order to protect and coordinate responses to cyber attacks, owners and operators of this critical infrastructure, including Enbridge, already work closely with the CISA, TSA and other agencies of the federal government and are subject to disclosure requirements to those agencies. As an owner and operator of critical energy infrastructure, we are concerned that the highly prescriptive requirements of the Proposed Rules would require public disclosure of detailed, sensitive information that is valuable to malicious threat actors and cyber attackers, thereby increasing cybersecurity risks. The Proposed Rules include, for example, the requirement to disclose the effect on the registrants operations and the incident remediation status. Detailed disclosures regarding a material cybersecurity incident, particularly before it is contained or remediated, or of a companys cybersecurity policies or procedures, could be exploited by an attacker to exacerbate an ongoing attack, exploit perceived vulnerabilities, or progress the targeting or sophistication of future attacks, thereby putting companies, investors and others at further risk. Detailed updates to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents, in particular material effects or future impacts to a registrants operations, incident remediation status and any changes to the registrants policies and procedures as a result of a cybersecurity incident, similarly provide information that could be exploited by cyber attackers. We believe that substantially less prescriptive requirements could help mitigate these risks. We encourage the Commission ensure its approach to cybersecurity information reporting is coordinated with other federal agencies, such as CISA and TSA, including in relation to security considerations and administrative and cost burdens to companies from multiple reporting requirements. Law Enforcement Exemption The Proposed Rules do not provide for any exemption from disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents where another law enforcement agency is involved. We believe a law enforcement exemption is necessary to avoid undermining national, corporate or personal security interests. We respectfully encourage the Commission to reconsider its approach to investor protection superseding other considerations. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. We welcome additional opportunities to further engage with the Commission on this topic.  Sincerely,  Enbridge Inc.  (Signed) Robert R. Rooney  Robert R. Rooney, Q.C.

At the outset, please know APGA appreciates the rationale behind the Commissions proposed rule to reduce the risk of inadvertently exposing investors to cybersecurity threats. However, there are some concerns with the proposal as written, and APGA respectfully requests that the Commission consider the below. APGA is the trade association for more than 730 communities across the U.S. that own and operate their retail natural gas distribution entities. They include not for profit gas distribution systems owned by municipalities and other local government entities, all locally accountable to the citizens they serve. Public gas systems focus on providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy to their customers and support their communities by delivering fuel to be used for cooking, clothes drying, and space and water heating, as well as for various commercial and industrial applications.1 The SECs proposal does not directly impose new requirements on public utilities, but APGA members are a part of a complex natural gas supply chain, which does contain companies that will have to comply.  APGA is concerned that the burden this proposed rule could put on companies upstream of the public, local distribution utility will impact their operations. APGAs members work hard to maintain a resilient system and coordinate with natural gas supply chain partners to provide energy to customers for use in their homes, businesses, or small industry. Any security related regulations need to be practical, maintaining a balance between delivering reliable, affordable natural gas and, in this case, protecting investors. As the SEC finalizes the proposal, APGA urges to be cognizant of trickle down impacts that could occur and significantly affect all along the supply chain. One specific way those required to comply could face unnecessary burdens is with premature disclosures, as mandated in the written language of the proposed rule. The SEC needs to be cautious in what incidents and when any investigation details are required. APGA believes it is excessive to require  1 For more information, please visit www.apga.org. 2  disclosure of all cyber incidents that lead to changes in the companys policies and procedures, as some underlying cyber incidents are entirely immaterial. There is a chance that this requirement could even disincentivize companies from improving cyber policies. As well, APGA asks that the SEC should allow for appropriate time to investigate before disclosure is made. Practical reporting, both what and when, is what is needed. Without sensible requirements, companies could potentially be exposed to additional cyber threats, which makes APGAs members vulnerable, given they are downstream. The SEC should not be acting in a way that unintentionally increases the cyber risk to public natural gas utilities or any company.  As mentioned, APGA is firmly aligned with the SEC in the objective of this rulemaking. Investors need to know their risks, and cyber security is one. However, APGA asks that in the formulation of the final rulemaking, trickle down impacts be considered. Thank you for allowing the opportunity to offer comments. If you have any questions regarding this submission, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Respectfully submitted,  Dave Schryver  President & CEO American Public Gas Association",1

NRF is the worlds largest retail trade association, representing discount and department stores, home goods and specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants, and internet retailers from the United States and more than 45 other countries. The purpose of NRF is to advocate for the economic and policy interests of retailers. NRF regularly convenes hundreds of retail brands to discuss data privacy and cybersecurity matters. Cybersecurity issues are increasingly important to retailers as more retail business is conducted online each year. A secure cyberspace is crucial to the functioning of our members operating online and in traditional store fronts. NRF is committed to the important issue of ensuring retailers—both online and in person— are safe and secure in their online functions for the protection of their customers, employees, and investors. Although we acknowledge the substantial interest in protecting companies and their customers from cybersecurity threats, we believe the proposal suffers from several legal and policy flaws and should not be finalized in its current structure.  • The Commission lacks legal authority to finalize the cybersecurity rule. The statutory context of the SECs enabling legislation demonstrates that the SECs power to issue disclosure rules is limited to specific types of information closely related to the disclosing companys value and financial condition. The cybersecurity rule seeks to require disclosure of information beyond these limits and thus exceeds the SECs statutory authority. The proposal, if finalized, also raises serious constitutional questions regarding the separation of powers. National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 2  • The cybersecurity rule is inconsistent with the Securities and the Exchange Acts objectives and would be arbitrary and capricious if finalized. Each aspect of the proposal suffers from practical challenges that undermine any advantages to investors from the required disclosures. The incident disclosure rule will make companies more vulnerable to further attacks, disrupt incident response measures, and it lacks clear guidelines of what is material in the cybersecurity incident context. The policy disclosure rule will highlight company vulnerabilities to both cyber criminals and competition. The governance disclosure rule is unnecessary to protect investors and micromanages company cybersecurity governance measures, which goes beyond the Commissions expertise.  • The cybersecurity rule is not cost effective. The costs of complying with the cybersecurity rule, which will include renegotiating contracts with third party IT professionals and increased auditing costs, among others, cannot be justified— especially when the proposal acknowledges that it is unable to quantify the potential benefit of the rule to investors. Less burdensome alternatives to the proposal, like maintaining the status quo under the SECs 2018 guidance pertaining to cybersecurity disclosures, would inform investors of cybersecurity risks that may affect the value of a security in a more cost effective manner. I. The Commission Lacks Legal Authority to Finalize the Cybersecurity Rule. Statutory Authority: The SECs rulemaking authority is limited to topics for which Congress has expressly delegated rulemaking authority.1 Generally speaking, the SEC is charged with protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.2 Its authority does not extend to all aspects of registrant company operations, and the proposal oversteps the Commissions delegated authority by seeking to regulate private companies cybersecurity disclosures and policies.  The proposals only discussion of the SECs statutory basis for delving into cybersecurity is a single sentence asserting that the SEC proposes the cybersecurity rule under the authority set forth in Sections 7 and 19(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 14, 15, and 23(a) of the Exchange Act.3 This is insufficient for two reasons: First, this conclusory statement fails to provide stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to comment upon the authorities on which the Commission relies for the proposal. Second, although Congress may have given the SEC  1 New York Stock Exch. LLC v. SEC, 962 F.3d 541, 554 (D.C. Cir. 2020); see also Louisiana Pub. Serv. Commn v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) ([A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.). 2 The Exchange Act authorizes the SEC to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities and having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to use its authority to achieve this goal. 15 U.S.C. § 78k 1(a)(2). 3 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16,590, 16,618 (proposed March 23, 2022) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 229, 232, 239, 240, 249). National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 3  rulemaking authority necessary to implement these provisions of the statutes, it is not clear how or why the proposal furthers those provisions. And the SECs apparent interpretation of its authority surpasses that granted to it by Congress because the Commission fails to read the cited sections of the Securities and Exchange Acts in their statutory context.  The proposal deprives NRF a meaningful opportunity to comment upon the legality of the rule because it does not specify which provisions of the relevant statutes the proposal would carry out (other than a passing citation, without elaboration, to over 70 pages of statutory text).4 The opportunity for public comment on proposed regulations must be a meaningful opportunity.5 Further explanation of the actual statutory authority upon which the SEC intends to rely, with an explanation for why the proposal is necessary or appropriate to achieve the statutes goals, is necessary for the SEC to receive effective comments and ensure the proposal is set to withstand inevitable future legal challenges.  In any event, although not specifically discussed in the proposal, NRF assumes the SEC is purporting to act under the provisions granting the Commission rulemaking authority in Sections 7(a)(1) and 19(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 12(b)(1), 13(a), and 23(a) of the Exchange Act.6 These provisions give the SEC specific authority to require certain financial disclosures and the general authority to make rules necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act, but this rulemaking authority is not boundless.  Section 19(a) of the Securities Act empowers the SEC to make . . . rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of [the Securities Act].7 Likewise, Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act empowers the SEC to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of [the Exchange Act].8 However, these grants of authority cannot be read in isolation but must be read to only enable rulemaking, as the statutes make plain, to carry out another specific provision of the Act. As the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently explained, these general provisions do not empower the agency to pursue rulemaking that is not otherwise authorized[.]9 In other words,  4 Id. 5 Rural Cellular Assn v. FCC, 588 F.3d 1095, 1101 (D.C. Cir. 2009). 6 15 U.S.C. §§ 77g(a)(1), 77s(a), 78l(b)(1), 78m(a), 78w(a).  7 Id. § 77s(a). 8 Id. § 78w(a)(1). 9 In New York Stock Exchange LLC, the Court analyzed, and ultimately vacated, a SEC rule promulgated under the Commissions general rulemaking authority in Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act. See 962 F.3d at 556. The Court relied on Michigan v. EPA, where the Supreme Court made clear that the mere reference to necessary or appropriate in a statutory provision authorizing an agency to engage in rulemaking does not afford the agency authority to adopt regulations as it sees fit with respect to all matters covered by the agencys authorizing statute. Id.; see also Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 751 (2015) (EPA strayed far beyond th[e] bounds [of reasonable National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 4  these general grants of authority, alone, are insufficient to provide the SEC with legal authority to finalize the proposal. Moreover, the rulemaking provisions statutory context belies any assertion that they confer broad authority beyond what is necessary or appropriate to implement some other specific provision of the Acts. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.10 The statutory context of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act demonstrates that the SECs power to issue disclosure rules is limited to specific types of information closely related to the disclosing companys value and financial condition.  The language after the general rulemaking provision in Section 19(a) of the Securities Act is instructive in this regard. After the grant of general rulemaking authority, the Act lists examples of authority the SEC has under the provision. These include generating forms, detailing items included on a balance statement, and dictating the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts.11 These examples show that this general rulemaking power is not all encompassing, but that Congress meant to empower the SEC to determine details necessary to fulfill specific directives in the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  Because the general rulemaking provisions alone are insufficient to empower the SEC to finalize the proposal, the SEC must specify which provision of the Securities Act and Exchange Act it is acting under. The proposal does make a passing citation to other statutory provisions that reference rulemaking authority in its one sentence explanation of statutory authority. Specifically, Section 7(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Sections 12(b)(1) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act give the Commission authority to impose some disclosure obligations. These specific directives, however, when read in context, likewise fall short of giving the SEC the authority to finalize the proposal. First, Section 7(a)(1) of the Securities Act serves a very specific purpose that the proposal does not further.12 Entitled Information Required in Registration Statement, Section 7 provides that a registration statement for a security must be accompanied by the documents, specified in Schedule A.13 Schedule A, included in the Securities Act at 15 U.S.C. § 77AA, is a detailed list of 32 required documents that reveal information about the identity of the actors involved and the financial status of a company. Schedule A requires, for example, disclosure of the names and addresses of the directors, the amount of securities of the issuer held by the directors (and other  interpretation] when it read [an appropriate and necessary provision] to mean that it could ignore cost when deciding whether to regulate power plants.).  10 FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989)). 11 15 U.S.C. § 77s(a). 12 Id. § 77g(a)(1). 13 Id. National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 5  key persons), and the amount of the funded debt outstanding.14 These disclosures are meant to reveal less apparent interests, liabilities, and financial information about the company to potential investors. The House report preceding the Securities Act explained that items in Schedule A are items indispensable to any accurate judgment upon the value of a security . . . [t]he type of information to be disclosed is of a character comparable to that demanded by competent bankers from their borrowers[.]15 Schedule A does not mention cybersecurity or any other similarly specific aspect of a companys operations. Rather, as the SEC has acknowledged, the items in Schedule A are largely financial in nature and were intended to help investors assess a securitys value.16 Section 7(a)(1) of the Securities Act contains two caveats. First, the SEC may promulgate a rule excluding some Schedule A information from a required disclosure if it concludes the information is not necessary for adequate disclosure to investors in particular classes of issuers.17 Second, the specific rulemaking provision comes in: the SEC may adopt rules to require a registration statement to include other information or documents as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.18 Thus, when this rulemaking provision is read in context, it becomes clear that Congress gave the Commission the ability to require the disclosure of additional Schedule A type documents, which are largely financial in nature. Although the SEC may exclude and supplement certain Schedule A information, the Commission should not read the rulemaking provision in Section 7(a)(1) to allow it to require broad disclosures on any topic, like cybersecurity incidents and policies.  Second, Section 12(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, which explains the necessary information to include in an application for registering a security, also contains a specific rulemaking provision. Section 12(b)(1) provides that an application shall contain information, in such detail as to the issuer [and affiliated entities and persons] as the Commission may by rules and regulations require, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, in respect to the following [categories of information].19 Section 12(b)(1)(A) (L) then lists 12 specific categories of information, including the nature of the business, the terms of outstanding securities, descriptions of directors, officers, and major shareholders, material contracts, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and other financial statements. These categories, of course, do not include  14 Id. §§ 77AA(4), (7), (12). 15 H.R Rep. No. 73 85, 73rd Cong., 1st Sess., 1933. 16 SEC, Concept Release, Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S K, 81 Fed. Reg. 23,916, 23,921 (April 22, 2016). 17 15 U.S.C. § 77g(a)(1) ([T]he Commission may by rules or regulations provide that such information or document need not be included in respect of any class of issuers or securities if it finds that the requirement of such information or document is inapplicable to such class and that disclosure fully adequate for protection of investors is otherwise required to be included within the registration statement.).  18 Id. 19 Id. § 78l(b)(1) (emphasis added). National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 6  cybersecurity information. When Section 12(b)(1)s rulemaking provision is read in the limited sense of creating rules directly related to the prescribed categories of information, it is clear that the Commission does not have authority under this provision to promulgate cybersecurity disclosure requirements.  Third, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act contains a rulemaking provision, which, like Section 12(a), is limited to rules requiring the disclosure of financial information when read in context. Section 13(a) provides: Every issuer of a [registered security] shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the security  (1) such information . . . the Commission shall require to keep reasonably current the information [supplied to register securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act] (2) such annual reports . . . certified if required . . . by independent public accountants, and such quarterly reports . . . as the Commission may prescribe.20  The statutory language allowing the SEC to issue rules requiring annual and quarterly reports has no explicit subject matter restriction in Section 13(a)(2). But the provision is limited when read together with Section 13(b)(1). Section 13(b)(1) demonstrates that the rulemaking power granted to the SEC regarding requiring annual and quarterly reports is limited to subjects directly related to balance sheets, earnings statements, and related items indicative of financial health, not cybersecurity protocols. Specifically, Section 13(b)(1) provides: The Commission may prescribe, in regard to reports made pursuant to this chapter, the form or forms in which the required information shall be set forth, the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and the earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of reports, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation of investment and operating income, and in the preparation, where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable, of separate and/or consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control with the issuer[.]21  20 Id. § 78m(a)(1) (2).  21 Id. § 78m(b)(1) (emphasis added). National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 7  This limited reading of Section 13(a)(2) makes sense. Section 13(a)(2) gives the SEC authority to require annual reports to be certified by independent public accountants. It would be quite unusual for cybersecurity disclosures required by the proposal (or similar non financial information) to benefit from certification by public accountants who have no expertise in cybersecurity. This limited reading is likewise confirmed by the House report for the Exchange Act, which emphasizes that annual and quarterly company reports would provide financial and accounting information to give some assurance that reports will not hide the true condition of the company.22  When the rulemaking provisions in the Securities Act and Exchange Act are read in context, as they must, the provisions are circumscribed more than the proposal seems to acknowledge— they are best read to empower the SEC to require disclosures of specific financial information to give investors a true picture of the securities on the market.  Moreover, when Congress desires that the SEC require public companies to disclose information beyond the clearly financial information authorized by the Securities Act and Exchange Act, Congress specifically authorizes the Commission to prescribe such rules in further statutory enactments. For example, Congress has used statutory authorizations to require disclosures on corporate responsibility, corporate governance, and selected aspects of executive compensation.23 Indeed, Congress frequently updates the securities laws, and yet it tellingly has not charged the Commission with requiring cybersecurity disclosures like those in the proposal.24  But Congress has not been silent in the area of cybersecurity. Acknowledging that cybersecurity is an issue of paramount concern to the safety and security of our country, Congress has repeatedly legislated to combat this ever growing national security and economic threat and has empowered federal agencies other than the SEC to serve that important purpose.25 Just this  22 H.R.

Cybersecurity is certainly an area of growing importance to companies across the world. Regardless of how serious the problem is, the Commission cannot exercise its authority ‘in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.28  Separation of Powers: If the SECs authority is not limited to requiring public disclosures of financially related information, as demonstrated by the text and context of the Securities and Exchange Acts, the proposal faces a separate set of legal failings. The major questions doctrine and the non delegation doctrine are both principles that protect the separation of powers and ensure that any new laws governing the lives of Americans are subject to the robust democratic processes the Constitution demands.29 Under the major questions doctrine, the courts expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an executive agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.30 In compliance with this doctrine, Congress has spoken clearly when it previously authorized the Commission to require disclosures related to specific public policy concerns, such as conflict minerals.31 As previously noted, if Congress meant for the SEC to broadly regulate public companies cybersecurity policy and disclosures, it would have clearly authorized it to do so with the requisite specificity. Modernization Act of 2014, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3551, 3554 (codifying information security requirements for the federal government to be administered by the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security) 26 Georgia Wood, Cybersecurity Legislation in the 117th Congress, Center for Strategic & International Studies (Dec. 6, 2021), https://www.csis.org/blogs/strategic technologies blog/cybersecurity legislation 117th congress; Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong.

See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022). 28 Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 91 (2002) (quoting FDA v.

National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 9  If the Securities Act and Exchange Act were as broad as the SEC seemingly interprets them to be, and somehow delegates limitless authority for the SEC to require public disclosures on any topic it deems in the public interest or as protecting investors, then the proposal may raise serious concerns about whether the Acts would violate the non delegation doctrine.32  II. The Cybersecurity Rule Is Inconsistent with the Commissions Statutory Objectives and Would be Arbitrary and Capricious if Finalized.  Even if the SEC had the authority to finalize the proposal, it should choose not to because it is inconsistent with the objectives of the Securities Act and Exchange Act. Each aspect of the proposal—the incident disclosures, policy disclosures, and governance disclosures—suffers from practical challenges which undermine any advantages to investors from disclosure. Accordingly, the proposal does not serve the SECs mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. Rather, the proposal imposes unnecessary costs and risks upon disclosing companies while wading into an area better regulated by Congress and the agencies specifically tasked with combatting cybersecurity threats. The SEC has not articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for proposing the rule.33 As such, it would be arbitrary and capricious if finalized.  Incident Disclosure: The proposals requirement to report incidents four days after the incident becomes material (even if still ongoing) could disrupt incident response measures, including ongoing mitigation efforts, law enforcement outreach, and the voluntary sharing of threat information with other companies via Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs). Any law or regulation requiring the disclosure of a cybersecurity breach that is still ongoing should have protections in place for the disclosing company. For example, some state laws require disclosure of a cybersecurity incident in an even shorter time frame than the proposal, but those required disclosures are of a different character. State security breach disclosure laws require disclosures to be made directly to the affected persons and entities, rather than to the public.34 These state disclosure laws also typically have other safeguards in place for the disclosing company like law enforcement exemptions that delay a companys disclosure obligation.35 Similarly, Congress recently passed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, which requires covered entities to report certain cyber  32 See NFIB, 142 S. Ct. at 669 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). 33 Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (explaining that an agency must explain that there is a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  34 All 50 states have some version of a security breach notification law which requires businesses to notify individuals of a security breach of information involving personally identifiable information. See, e.g., O.C.G.A. 10 1 912 (requiring breached third parties to notify the relevant data owners or licensees within 24 hours of the discovery of a breach if personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person).  35 Id. (noting that the required notification may be delayed for law enforcement purposes).  National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 10  incidents to CISA within 72 hours of the incident.36 However, the Act cloaks covered entities who disclose cybersecurity incidents to the agency with a variety of liability (and other) protections to incentivize fair and accurate reporting.37 Unlike similar state and federal laws, the proposed cybersecurity rule would require companies to publicly disclose a breach, with no exemptions or protections, in a four day time frame, which may deprive the company of the chance to fully understand the nature and impacts of the attack or remedy the invasion before disclosing. This time frame may also lead to disclosures that are incomplete or later found to be inaccurate, given the inherently ambiguous nature of many potential cyber incidents. Requiring this disclosure before the full containment and remediation of the incident publicizes to other bad actors that the company has at least one exploitable vulnerability and may allow cybercriminals to further victimize the company—the disclosure could even prompt cybercriminals to begin hunting for the breached data. This could increase the ultimate harm to the company, owners of the stolen data, and accordingly increase the harm to investors.  The four day timeline will also shift important resources away from what should be companies highest priorities in response to potential cyber incidents: containing and remediating vulnerabilities, and mitigating and preventing any damages or loss. As part of incident response, many companies also appropriately prioritize engagement with law enforcement to support investigative activities, and the sharing of threat information on a voluntary basis (including with ISACs and ISAOs) to prevent future incidents. Instead, this four day timeline will compel companies to devote a large share of their cyber teams resources toward compliance with reporting requirements and making recurrent determinations about the potential materiality of incidents. Requiring companies to report incidents within four days will unreasonably divert attention away from crucial response measures and could impair or chill companies existing efforts to engagement with law enforcement and share cyber threat information. To the extent reporting to the SEC would be appropriate at all, it should be within a reasonable time after the incident has been resolved. Further, without clear guidelines of what is material in this specific context, the SEC will expose the regulated community to arbitrary enforcement and liability. The concept of materiality refers to information that a reasonable investor would find important in making an investment decision. If a cyber attack were so extensive that it would impact the financial health of a company or the fruitfulness of an investment, existing requirements would likely already require disclosure. As such, the proposed requirement suggests that the commission anticipates some other metric. And without the Commission explaining what that metric is and under what authority the Commission imposes it, the proposal would subject the regulated community to arbitrary enforcement. The lack of clear guidance as to what constitutes a material cybersecurity incident also presents a due process problem. A regulation that does not give ordinary people fair notice  36 See Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong. (2022). 37 See H.R. 2471 § 2245(a) (c). National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 11  of the conduct it punishes violates an essential requirement of due process.38 If people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [a regulations] meaning, like they would here, it will be deemed unconstitutionally vague.39  Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy: The proposals requirement to disclose policies and procedures to manage cybersecurity risks may highlight company vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber criminals or competition. The proposal would require registrants to describe their policies and procedures . . . for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats.40 It is undoubtably important for companies to maintain such policies and procedures. Yet it is equally important for them to remain nimble and able to address quickly emerging threats and trends. The level of detail required by the proposal would allow cybercriminals to search for and exploit vulnerabilities in those policies and procedures and prevent the degree of flexibility companies need to change practices and procedures as threats emerge. It also may expose proprietary or confidential processes to competition. As written, the proposal has not grappled with how the potential benefits, if any, from the proposal would outweigh these threats.  This section of the SECs proposal also includes a problematic requirement for companies to disclose information with respect to their use of assessors, consultants, auditors and other third parties to support cyber risk assessment. The SECs proposal seems to imply that this information would contribute to a meaningful assessment of a companys cybersecurity risk management. There is no clear basis to assert that the use of such third parties is a determinant of improved cybersecurity risk management, and many of NRFs member companies have developed internal cybersecurity risk management capabilities that obviate the need for the extensive use of such third parties. Governance Disclosure: The SEC has not explained why a detailed list of governance related cybersecurity disclosures is needed for the protection of investors. The regulation would require, among other things, the disclosure of: (1) a board members cybersecurity expertise, (2) whether the company has a chief information security officer, their relevant expertise, and where they fit in the organizational chart, and (3) granular information about the interactions of management and the board of directors on cybersecurity, including the frequency with which the various actors discuss the topic.41 This level of detail in governance related information is unprecedented in SEC regulation, is inflexible in its approach, and is simply not needed for investors to make sound investment decisions. As Commissioner Pierce explains, this laundry list of requirements, in a way, dictates the Commissions expectations for how a companys governance should be  38 Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. 591, 595 (2015); Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U.S. 337, 338 39 (1952) (considering a vagueness challenge to an administrative regulation). 39 Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). 40 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,619. 41 Id. at 16,600. National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 12  structured to withstand cybersecurity threats.42 This area is beyond the Commissions expertise. While the integration of cybersecurity expertise into corporate decision making likely is a prudent business decision . . . whether, how, and when to do so should be left to business—not SEC— judgment.43  For instance, the proposals requirement that companies disclose the cybersecurity expertise of board members (which implicitly preferences such expertise in board members) may be unsound business judgment for most registrants. Board members are not directly implementing cybersecurity policy—especially in industries such as retail, in which cyber security is not the core business—and it is unclear why there should be an expectation that all public companies search for and elect board members with cybersecurity expertise. Of course, board members should be aware of technology and general cybersecurity risks to help make decisions and manage corporate risk on behalf of the company. But board members are not directly implementing cybersecurity policy or responding to cybersecurity incidents, which makes specific training and expertise in cybersecurity response measures unnecessary. In addition, as a practical matter, because cybersecurity best practices and technical capabilities are constantly evolving, it is unclear how, for example, a decades old degree or certification in cybersecurity would be especially helpful in managing the risks cybersecurity poses to public companies today.  III. The Commission Should Fully Consider the Economic Costs of the Cybersecurity Rule Before Finalizing. The proposal underestimates the costs associated with complying with the rule. For instance, managing relationships with third party IT professionals to comply with reporting obligations is costly and will require companies to renegotiate contracts and relationships with third party service providers in order to further support reporting obligations. Specifically, the proposal will expand the degree of third party audit costs that registrants must incur to assure the accuracy of the reported information. Many NRF members already spend millions of dollars on average per year auditing SEC disclosures. Each added requirement will substantially increase those efforts. What is more, it is unclear that the proposal will inure benefits that could even begin to justify its costs. The SEC has a statutory obligation to determine as best it can the economic implications of the [proposal.]44 As the proposal notes, the Commission has been unable to quantify the potential benefit to investors and other market participants from the increased disclosure requirements in the proposal. Although the Commission may not need to quantify all potential  42 See Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal by Commissioner Peirce, SEC.GOV (March 9, 2022), https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922 (Such precise disclosure requirements look more like a list of expectations about what issuers cybersecurity programs should look like and how they should operate.). 43 Id.  44 Chamber of Com. of the United States of America v. SEC, 412 F.3d 133, 143 (D.C. Cir. 2005). National Retail Federation May 9, 2022 Page 13  benefits, it must undertake a reasonable assessment of them. And it cannot do so without supporting predictive judgements, quantifying costs where it can, and relying upon empirical data.  Instead of doing so, the proposal merely speculates about the benefits. For example, the proposal suggests that investors would benefit from more informed disclosure, but it does not say how or cite to any studies that specifically explain why investors would benefit from the newly required information or how the lack of that information has harmed them. It speculates that delayed or incomplete reporting of cybersecurity incidents and risks could lead to mispricing of securities without identifying any incidents, let alone widespread incidents, where it has.45 It suggests that registrants could benefit from more uniform disclosures, but concedes that it is unable to assess those benefits.46 The proposal suggests that the cybersecurity rule could have positive effects on market efficiency, but fails to assess whether and how it actually will. Absent more information that would reasonably suggest investors would benefit from the proposals requirements, the Commission simply fails to meet its obligation to assess the proposals economic implications. Lastly, alternatives to the proposal would achieve the SECs desired objective in a more cost effective manner. For example, the Commission could simply require registrants to disclose whether they have cybersecurity measures in place and more generally disclose material risks and how they would be mitigated, rather than detailing a laundry list of policy and governance information to be disclosed. This alternative to the proposal would just as effectively inform investors of the true value of their securities—with a much lower cost. Further, maintaining the SECs current cybersecurity incident reporting regime is more cost effective than finalizing the proposal. The status quo of cybersecurity disclosures under the SECs current guidance best balances the competing interests at play. Under the SECs current guidance, from its 2018 Interpretive Release, companies already should timely disclose information in periodic reports about material cybersecurity incidents to investors.47 This guidance provides companies with needed discretion to ascertain the relevant facts to be disclosed and acknowledges that some material facts may not be available at the time of the initial disclosure, that a company may require time to discern the implications of a cybersecurity incident, and that ongoing investigation of a cybersecurity incident may affect the scope of disclosure regarding the incident.48 The 2018 Interpretive Release strikes the right balance between keeping investors informed of cybersecurity incidents that may affect a securitys value and leaving companies with needed control over their policies, procedures, and incident response.

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the SECs or the Commissions) Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposal.1 We appreciate the engagement that the Chamber has had with the SEC on this complex issue.  The Chamber agrees with the Commission that responsible cybersecurity policies and practices are in the best interest of investors, boards of directors, and management. However, any cybersecurity disclosure policies must abide by the norms of materiality and the SECs legal mandate to promote investor protection, competition, and capital formation. As it stands, the Chamber contends that the proposed rules have several significant flaws:  • The Commissions proposal conflicts with the policy goals established by Congress in recent cybersecurity legislation, including the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which requires certain critical infrastructure entities to report on a confidential and protected basis covered cyber incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours.  • The SECs proposed rules leave businesses in the unenviable position of facing conflicting cybersecurity reporting directives from several U.S. agencies. The Chamber believes that there needs to be more assertive harmonization of cybersecurity incident reporting policies to enable businesses to understand and follow clear, consistent guidelines and processes. 2 • The public disclosure of a companys cybersecurity policies and practices, as envisioned by the SEC proposed rules, could provide a roadmap for bad actors and hostile nation states from which they can attack businesses. Such disclosure degrades investor protection and harms competition and capital formation.  • The SEC has failed to provide industry with the opportunity to fully assess and comment on the costs and benefits of its proposal. A basic review of the proposed rules indicates that this is an economically significant rulemaking, and it should be subject to an enhanced economic analysis of the expected costs.  Accordingly, the Chamber believes that the current proposal has severe deficiencies requiring the SEC to reassess the proposal and hold a roundtable with stakeholders, including investors, business groups, and government entities, to identify key issues and solutions. The Chamber trusts that such a deliberative approach could yield disclosures related to cybersecurity that stand the test of time and enable the SEC to meet its legal mandate. We look forward to working constructively with the SEC to achieve those goals.  ***  The remainder of this letter consists of business community feedback to some of the key themes and questions put forth in the Commissions rulemaking. The Chamber does not attempt to answer each question that the SEC asks. On May 2, 2022, the Chamber urged the SEC to extend the comment period by an additional 45 days, but the Commission disagreed.  The complexity of the SECs cybersecurity rulemaking warranted additional time for at least three reasons:  • The Commissions proposed amendments include an array of reporting, risk management and strategy, and governance topics that are highly detailed and would have important impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and U.S. economic and national security (e.g., public private partnerships). Alone, this section covers some 40 questions for commenters.  • The economic analysis portion of the rule covers many lengthy and intricate studies (some of which are not freely available to the public) that the stakeholders deserve time to thoroughly analyze in formulating responses to the rulemaking. Indeed, the Commission has not attempted to calculate any quantitative values for benefits of the proposed rule. Moreover, the benefits are only described in vague qualitative terms.  • In addition to this cybersecurity rulemaking, the Commission is promulgating several other rules affecting the business community that have overlapping comment periods and divide the time and attention of industry professionals. The SECs decision to put forth multiple proposals, combined with short comment periods, raises concerns about the adequacy of the Commissions rule writing process.2  5  and sectors, like government entities, are susceptible to cybersecurity incidents. The business community is working diligently to respond to and mitigate these risks. Senior managers and boards are both increasingly concerned about cybersecurity threats and are taking concrete steps to protect their information systems and digital assets.  The Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance helps companies understand their cybersecurity related reporting obligations, including the importance of policies and procedures and the application of insider trading prohibitions.4 The Chamber is committed to working with the SEC to craft consistent, useful, and timely company disclosures on registrants material cybersecurity incidents and security programs to better guide investors. We agree with Chair Gary Genslers view that [a] lot of issuers already provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors, and that companies and investors alike would benefit if this information were required in a consistent, comparable, and decision useful manner.5  While the SECs proposed rules are predicated on our shared goals of meeting investor interests and responding to the evolving cyber landscape, disclosure rules should not reduce or put at risk companies security and resilience against criminal groups and foreign hackers and/or their proxies. As written, the proposed rules prioritize disclosures, which may or may not be useful to investors, over cybersecurity risk management. This approach would not protect shareholders and could have the opposite effect by putting companies in jeopardy by forcing them to allocate resources toward compliance based reporting rather than triaging the complex elements of identifying and resolving cybersecurity incidents. The disclosure of vulnerability data, if shared prematurely, could actually enable attackers.  Moreover, by requiring companies to disclose the nature of an attack before it is resolved, a disclosure of vulnerability data could actually enable attackers. This is not in the interest of the company or its shareholders and, therefore, the proposed rules miss the mark on investor protection. The Commission should focus on coordinating with other federal agencies on incident reporting where appropriate instead of creating a new regulatory regime that would contradict, if not undermine (e.g., in the case of law enforcement and national security investigations) the work of other government entities.  2. Chamber Policy Emphasizes Collaborative and Protective Programs  The Chambers cybersecurity policy baseline informs our views on congressional and executive branch policymaking and negotiations. In March 2021, the Chamber released a paper that highlights our thinking on some key cybersecurity themes and issues. The papers topics are summed up in 7 words—potential, program, protection, preemption, partnership, price, and promotion. It guides the Chambers evaluation of cybersecurity legislation and regulations, including the SECs proposed amendments, to negotiate policy outcomes that address multiple stakeholder (e.g., government and private sector) interests.  A missing element in the SECs synopsis of the global cybersecurity environment is the prominent role that foreign nation states and their proxies play in conducting illicit operations against companies and U.S. interests. Businesses are subject to relentless, often state sponsored, cyberattacks without effective government protection. Cyberspace remains the 8  Reform Act of 1995 and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. The Chamber requests that the SEC undertakes an enhanced economic analysis as required by law for economically significant rulemakings. Additionally, we would request that such an analysis be released for appropriate review and comment under the Administrative Procedures Act.  Given the likelihood that the costs of the proposed rule would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, it is crucial that the benefits be analyzed in quantitative detail. Failure to do so risks adoption of a regulation for which the costs far outweigh any reasonable estimation of the benefits. With the total initial yearly costs likely $317.5M to $523.4M ($38,690 to $69,151 per regulated company), and future annual costs of $184.8M to $308.1M ($22,300 to $37,500 per company), it is doubtful the Commissions evaluation that the discounted present value of benefits to investors would reasonably exceed the discounted present value of the costs.  4. Reporting Material Cybersecurity Incidents: The Mandatory 4 Day Window and the Level of Detail Required Raise Legitimate Security Concerns13  Under its proposed rules, the Commission would amend Form 8 K to add Item 1.05 to require a company to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within 4 business days after the company determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. The SEC argues that such reporting would significantly improve the timeliness of cybersecurity incident disclosures, as well as provide investors with more standardized and comparable disclosures. Specifically, a company would be required to disclose the following information about a material cybersecurity incident at the time of the Form 8 K filing:  o When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing. o A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident. o Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose. o The effect of the incident on the registrants operations. o Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.  The SEC contends that it would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident. However, it is difficult to square the SECs assurances to industry with the proposed mandate for registrants to disclose more data about a material cyber incident within 4 business days.  The mere fact of a premature or overly hasty disclosure of information, including regarding potential system vulnerabilities, would likely give attackers advantages over defenders. As the SEC recognizes, such disclosures would conflict with industry best practices and international standards for coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).14 Almost any public detail can provide clues to malicious actors, especially if they are combined with other unknown information (e.g., a zero day exploit). While an incident is ongoing, companies 9  should not be put in the position of having to determine which details are sufficiently vague and/or how a corresponding disclosure could negatively impact the online ecosystem at large.  At a minimum, hurried disclosures could result in incorrect information being shared with investors. Confidential information about a registrants technical security program could place it at increased risk because of a rushed push to disclose without adequate time to evaluate the substance of what is being disclosed.  The SEC says that in some instances, the timing of the companys materiality determination may coincide with the date of discovery of an incident, but in other cases, the materiality determination would be made after the discovery date. The Commission stresses that it expects registrants to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible. The Commission adds that ‘a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.  Rather than using the time sensibly to mitigate a cybersecurity incident before details are revealed openly, the proposed rules indicate that a company may prefer to delay making a materiality determination to evade its disclosure requirements. The Commission should carefully consider which priority matters more—protecting investors via effective cybersecurity incident mitigation or openly disclosing an incident that has not been fully remediated.  The Chamber opposes cybersecurity disclosure policies that would place a victim— and, by extension, the value of its shareholders investments—at an elevated risk of further victimization because the details surrounding a cybersecurity incident are prematurely made public, particularly if an incident has not been resolved. Furthermore, the Commission has not incorporated an exception to temporarily delay reporting of material incidents in cases where disclosures could negatively impact national security equities and/or law enforcement investigations against illicit hackers.  The Chamber agrees that information should be disclosed to investors in a timely and practical manner to assist investors decision making. Equally important, however, is the importance of safeguarding company, consumer, and shareholder data, particularly in in reports to government entities. Companies rightly guard against exposing system vulnerabilities, which can affect not only the cybersecurity of users but registrants and the wider internet ecosystem.  Government officials routinely advocate for strong cybersecurity and the importance of safeguarding of data—the Department of Defenses Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program is one of many examples that come to mind—and yet the Commissions proposed rules seem contrary to these goals. The Commission should not impede companies ability to safeguard sensitive cybersecurity and (in some cases) national security information.15  10 4.1 The SECs Rules Need to Accommodate Temporary Delays  The Chamber is concerned that the proposed rules would not authorize a temporary reporting delay because of a companys ongoing internal investigation or an external investigation, including one with or by law enforcement—which often directs a company not to disclose the nature of an investigation to avoid compromising an ongoing case. The Commission cites its 2018 interpretive guidance to noting that while an investigation could affect the specifics in a companys disclosure, an ongoing internal or external investigation— which often can be lengthy—would not on its own provide a basis for avoiding disclosures of a material cybersecurity incident. The Commission adds that any delay in reporting would undermine its policy goal of providing timely and consistent disclosure of cybersecurity incidents to investors.  The Chamber believes that this view is counterproductive. Delays would not undermine the Commissions policy objectives—just the opposite. The SEC should be actively urging companies to work with law enforcement to mitigate cyber incidents—including granting prudent reporting delays—to help companies security and financial positions, which ultimately benefits investors. The Commission contemplates whether the proposed rules should provide for a delay in reporting based on a request from the U.S. attorney general (AG). The SECs proposal must accommodate both the AG and appeals from industry and law enforcement more broadly.  The Commission needs to accommodate the AG and appeals from industry working in tandem with law enforcement more broadly. The Commission should expand the authority to delay public disclosure beyond the AG to other corners of government with jurisdiction over cybersecurity investigations. The Commission has been too parochial in its suggestion that only the AG has the requisite authority or expertise to intervene. The Chamber urges the SEC to develop a more workable process by which other appropriate government officials can prompt a reporting delay in consultation with the SEC. The fact of a rushed public disclosure of an incident—including an unpatched vulnerability—could alert a range of bad actors (e.g., criminals and nation states) to identify and attack other victims, which could lead to additional cyberattacks within and cross industries.  Similarly, issues related to public safety should be considered for certain critical industries. A premature disclosure of vulnerabilities in the automobile, airplane, and/or medical device sectors could cause unmerited panic. Premature disclosure could cause individuals to make safety related decisions based on incomplete information, such as deferring medical procedures or disconnecting certain types of devices from the internet. It can take significant time and effort, often alongside government authorities, to not only determine the appropriate fix for vulnerabilities but allow it to be done safely. Particularly in the health care space, patient safety must be the top concern with any cybersecurity vulnerability, and policymakers must not inadvertently impact patients in the rush to disclose material cybersecurity incidents.  11  As written, the proposed rules could damage the public private partnerships that industry and the public sector have spent years cultivating, including at the governments behest through energetic information sharing programs. The SECs proposed rules need to allow a reporting delay per a request from law enforcement below the level of the AG or another agency (e.g., a sector risk management agency) that is authorized by law to conduct cybersecurity investigations if the affected company gives its consent to authorities.  To the extent that the SEC is considering proposing the disclosure of information revealing vulnerabilities, such a policy would be inconsistent with international standards and industry best practices for CVD. Such a requirement would conflict with federal legislation, including apparently requiring federal contractors to follow the SECs rather than contracting agencies rules. Vulnerability information needs to be protected until mitigations are in place, a view that has wide consensus. In short, the Commissions proposed amendments would likely create an unworkable conflict between the SEC and other agencies on CVD. Registrants could be put in the position of either following the Commissions rules or protecting users by not disclosing vulnerability information based on international standards and industry best practices.  Many state data breach reporting laws allow a covered organization to delay notification if law enforcement concludes that such notice would impede an investigation. State laws also may allow a victim company to forgo providing notice altogether if the victim company consults with law enforcement and determines that the breach would not likely result in harm to the individuals whose personal information has been acquired and accessed. It is also noteworthy that companies that cooperate with law enforcement may be viewed more favorably by regulators looking into a data breach. While it may not be the Commissions intent, the rulemaking could turn company and law enforcement cooperation on its head.16  By requiring the disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident 4 days after a determination, the Form 8 K filing could precede—or almost preempt—data breach notices to state attorneys general, individuals, and potentially impacted business partners. Further, providing such details prior to the completion of a forensic investigation would likely expose companies to litigation before it has a full picture of the impact of a cybersecurity incident and undermine attorney client and work product privileges associated with investigating the cybersecurity incident.  The Chamber agrees with a letter written by several financial services sector associations, led by the Bank Policy Institute. The letter says, All 50 states have passed laws authorizing delayed disclosure to consumers of breaches of their sensitive personal data at the request of law enforcement to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act similarly authorizes such delayed disclosure by financial institutions, and federal law enforcement agencies make such requests of registrants in appropriate circumstances.17 The groups emphasize, Without a corresponding law enforcement exception, the [SECs proposed rules] would undermine the determination of all U.S. states and numerous federal agencies that law enforcements need to protect the public weighs in favor of a disclosure delay in limited circumstances.  14  or even a longer period, it is unclear whether they would be considered a series of reportable cybersecurity incidents.  Only in hindsight—and with the contributions of industry and government cybersecurity specialists—can some hacking groups (e.g., Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, both of which are linked to Russian intelligence) be readily considered a group of cybersecurity incidents or a relatively discernable campaign. Most often, potential material incidents in the aggregate would be difficult to identify and operationally challenging to track. In addition, the Commissions proposed definition of cybersecurity incident refers to any information on a companys system, so the SECs mandate would require reviewing virtually unlimited amounts of data over indefinite periods of time.  The SEC underestimates the burdens related to tracking several small but continuous cyberattacks against a company, which may or may not prove to be material. And the feasibility and value of such reporting to investors is questionable. The Commission should provide additional clarity around what constitutes this requirement to limit information overload to investors, particularly around events that have already occurred and been resolved by a company.  5. Streamlining Reporting Regulations Needs Greater Urgency  The Commission notes that many states have laws that allow companies to delay providing public notice about a data breach incident or notifying certain constituencies of such an incident if law enforcement determines that notification will impede a civil or criminal investigation. A registrant may have obligations to report incidents at the state or federal level. Nevertheless, these obligations are distinct, the SEC says, from a companys obligations to disclose material information to its shareholders under federal securities laws. In short, the SEC says that there is a possibility a registrant would be required to disclose [an] incident on Form 8 K even though it could delay incident reporting under a particular state law. But states give companies some 30 days to notify impacted consumers. Surely, the SEC is not suggesting that investors have a greater or better interest in disclosure than the impacted consumers. The Commission should be careful to not place an emphasis on the interests of investors over impacted consumers and national cybersecurity concerns.  The proposed amendments would add yet another requirement to many companies thick portfolio of state, federal, and in several cases international reporting mandates. SEC actions would further complicate businesses ability to fend off illicit hacking efforts while attempting to comply with cybersecurity regulations. Some organizations may be able these additional mandates as part of an already complicated regulatory regime, but others may not, resulting in greater harm to investors.  Attending to duplicative and potentially conflicting cybersecurity regulations places a major strain on companies limited resources, which the Commission seems to minimize as a concern. While companies must comply with many data breach disclosure requirements, the proposed rules would add another layer of complexity. The SEC says that that the requirements may cover some of the material incidents that companies would need to report 15  under the [SECs] proposed amendments, but not all incidents. The Commission notes that the timeliness and public reporting requirements of these [other] requirements vary, making it difficult for investors and other market participants to be alerted to the breaches, and to be provided with an adequate understanding of the impact of such incidents to registrants.  Adding more government cybersecurity disclosure requirements to companies legal obligations would not enhance U.S. cybersecurity. Indeed, the Chamber urges the SEC and other policymaking bodies to collaborate with industry to streamline the nearly countless data breach/data security/cybersecurity notification, disclosure, or incident reporting regulation, and not add to them. Where a federal regulation exists, the Chamber urges the SEC to reconsider its position on exemptions and incorporate into its proposed rule an exemption for entities that are subject to and in compliance with similar federal cybersecurity reporting regulations.  For many years, the Chamber has pressed federal policy officials to harmonize duplicative and overly burdensome information security requirements that impact regulated institutions. The SEC should not finalize its cybersecurity rules unless it can articulate a sensible plan to harmonize the multiple regulations that affect industry at the state, federal, and international levels vis à vis its rulemaking.  CIRCIA, or the cyber incident reporting law, calls on the NCD to lead an intergovernmental Cyber Incident Reporting Council composed of the Office of Management and Budget, CISA, and sector risk management agencies to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize federal incident reporting requirements, including those issued through regulations. The law also tasks the NCD and other federal agency officials to periodically review existing reporting requirements to avoid conflicting, duplicative, or burdensome requirements and streamline those reporting requirements and submit a report to Congress.22  Moreover, the NCDs October 2021 strategic statement places much emphasis on cybersecurity responsibilities to be more equitably and proportionally shared by those able to shoulder them. The NCD goes on to say, Achieving this vision will require cooperation across the many public, private, and international stakeholders in the ecosystem, and it will require coordination, so that these efforts are not operating at cross purposes but are instead mutually reinforcing. … First, and above all else, the [NCD] will champion federal coherence across U.S. government in cyber policy, action, and doctrine. It will improve public private collaboration to tackle cyber challenges across sectoral lines [italics in the original].23  The Chamber agrees with the NCDs thinking regarding cybersecurity cooperation and coordination, which the SECs proposed rules do not take into consideration. In the coming months, policy leaders ability to work effectively with industry to streamline various federal reporting/disclosure/notification laws and requirements will be significantly tested. The Chamber wants to contribute to this effort.  In sum, the Chamber respects the SECs obligations to protect investors, advocate for competition among companies, and advance capital formation. Yet its proposed cybersecurity regime overreaches by casting an overly broad net for company data. The day to day realities 16  of cybersecurity should inform the SEC that increased cybersecurity incident disclosures would probably translate into heightened risks for companies and their investors—which is the exact opposite of the Commissions policy objectives.  Without substantive changes, the SECs proposed rules could jeopardize companies security and resilience. The Commission needs to incorporate feedback from industry and government cybersecurity experts. It does not seem that the SEC consulted law enforcement and national security agencies in developing its rule. In a nutshell, the SECs intended amendments fall short of both safeguarding companies and advocating for investors by:  • Elevating threats to companies cybersecurity by compelling them to disclose more detailed cybersecurity incident data to the public, which includes criminals and other malicious actors.  • Pushing companies to potentially report too often and too early—particularly before investigations, including with law enforcement, are done—which could tip off illicit hackers and lead to inadvertent disclosure inaccuracies and negative market volatility.  • Disregarding laws and regulations that require protecting—not openly divulging— cybersecurity and related critical infrastructure information from bad actors. The SECs rules would essentially override these policies, which have been carefully developed by government and business officials over a decade and more.  6. The Commission Should Advocate for Legal Liability Protections Tied to Material Cybersecurity Incident Disclosures  The Chamber is generally supportive of reasonable cybersecurity disclosure policies. However, existing law and regulation do not endorse the public airing of unmitigated cybersecurity incident and vulnerability information. The Chamber has significant concerns with policies that would reveal the details of a companys cybersecurity incidents to the public—including investors as well as bad actors ranging from criminal gangs to foreign powers. The 3 laws noted in this letter were written to ensure that industry reporting on significant cybersecurity incidents get shared with government (principally CISA) in a timely fashion and handled in a manner that safeguards the victim and the sensitive details of a cybersecurity incident.  The Chamber appreciates the SECs interest in having companies make consistent, comparable, and decision useful disclosures. But industry is concerned with the Commission determining—without substantial justification and contrary to the judgment of Congress— what an adequate understanding of a material cybersecurity incident means and then having companies divulge such sensitive data to the public. The Chamber strongly believes that the details surrounding a cybersecurity incident should be handled with care and not exposed publicly until the danger that such an incident poses to the company or perhaps others is mitigated, thus denying malicious hackers the ability to exploit the incident to attack the company or similarly situated entities.  17  The proposed rules illustrate how fragmented policy approaches to industry disclosure can prove duplicative, confuse security requirements, and splinter organizations risk management budgets, and cause market distortions that weaken security for individual companies and collectively. The Chamber believes that the path forward is relatively straightforward—but not easy. Congress should pass legislation that extends legal liability protections to industry for company information that is disclosed to the public because of the Commissions proposed amendments. Such a law would have the virtues of giving policymakers, the business community, and investors more of what they need.24  The SEC is seeking consistent, useful, and timely company disclosures on registrants material cybersecurity incidents and security programs, which can help advise investors. Industry seeks these outcomes too. However, registrants need policymakers to better balance federal regulation with legal liability and related protections, consider the growing private sector costs of defending against nation states, and harmonize and promote U.S. policies at home and internationally. Last year the Chamber worked closely with House and Senate lawmakers on CIRCIA. The law contains both reporting requirements and protections that were thoughtfully negotiated by lawmakers and industry.  7. Disclosure of a Companys Cybersecurity Programs: Informing Investors and Protecting Company Data Should Be Complementary  7.1 RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY  Under the Commissions proposal, Item 106(b) would require registrants to disclose their policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats (e.g., operational risk, intellectual property theft, and fraud).25 Specifically, proposed Item 106(b) of Regulation S K would require disclosure of whether:  • A company has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and a description of it.  • A company engages assessors, consultants, auditors, or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program.  • A company has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third party service provider (e.g., providers that have access to the companys customer and employee data).  • Cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of third party providers (e.g., through contracts and other mechanisms) a company uses to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to these providers.  • A company undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents.  • A company has business continuity, contingency, and recovery plans in the event of a cybersecurity incident. 18 • Previous cybersecurity incidents have informed changes in a companys governance, policies and procedures, or technologies.  • Cybersecurity related risk and incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to affect a companys results of operations or financial condition and if so, how.  • Cybersecurity risks are considered as part of a companys business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation and if so, how.  The SEC states, [M]ost of the registrants that disclosed a cybersecurity incident in 2021 did not describe their cybersecurity risk oversight and related policies and procedures. Some companies, the Commission notes, provided only general disclosures, such as a reference to cybersecurity as one of the risks overseen by the board or a board committee. The Commission is proposing Item 106(b) of Regulation S K to require registrants to provide more consistent and detailed disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management and strategy. The Commission contends that disclosure of a companys relevant policies and procedures would benefit investors by providing greater transparency regarding the companys cybersecurity risk management strategy.  The Chamber asserts that there is a reasonable explanation for why a company may provide a comparatively high level summary rather than a detailed description of its cybersecurity risk management program. Put simply, this approach is necessary to reduce the risk of compromise from a cyberattack that could be facilitated by an adversary obtaining access to a companys relevant cybersecurity policies and procedures because of the SECs proposed reporting regime. If the Commission moves forward with the proposal, it must take these consequences into account and thoroughly explain any analysis that justifies more detailed disclosures.  The Commission has not offered a persuasive argument that there is an unmet demand for greater transparency into a companys cybersecurity risk management efforts. Even if the SEC were to make a convincing case for increased transparency, public policy would need to be tempered to safeguard companies cybersecurity programs. No organization—public or private—is typically willing to reveal the contents of its cybersecurity gameplan to friendly parties, much less to nation state hackers or their surrogates, which would have access cybersecurity risk oversight and related policies and procedures.  To be sure, the SECs 2018 interpretive guidance notes that the guidance is not intended to suggest that a company should make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts—for example, by providing a ‘roadmap for those who seek to penetrate a companys security protections. The Commission adds that it does not expect companies to publicly disclose specific, technical information about their cybersecurity systems, the related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would make such systems, networks, and devices more susceptible to a cybersecurity incident (FR8169).  19  In contrast, the Commission clearly wants companies to disclose more details in their disclosures, which is a departure from its 2018 interpretive guidance. This guidance rejects having companies publicly disclose specific, technical information about their cybersecurity systems. But in its current rulemaking, the SEC clearly wants companies to disclose more detail in their disclosures (FR16594). The Commission should be mindful of what it requests registrants to disclose under its proposed rules. The SEC may believe that changes to its disclosure rules wouldnt put companies at a heightened risk for additional cyberattacks. However, many security specialists in the business community are alarmed by the rule and industry concerns must be considered. Information that the Commission requires to be publicly disclosed would be made available to both benign actors and nefarious hackers.  7.1.1 What Is Too Much Cybersecurity Information for Bad Actors  How much information about a companys cybersecurity risk oversight and related policies and procedures would be too risky to be made public? The SECs rulemaking does not grapple with this important question in a way that is beneficial to companies, based on feedback that the Chamber has received. It may be useful to move from the abstract rulemaking to real world tools and regulations, such as the joint industry and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security directive, respectively, to answer the question.  Many private entities use the popular CSF. The CSF is built on five key functions— Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—that provide a comprehensive view of the life cycle for managing cybersecurity risks and threats over time. The table that follows captures the 5 functions of the CSF, some basic activities under each one, and some questions that the SEC should address as is considers its rulemaking.26  [Go to the next page.]  21 policies and procedures would benefit investors.  Yet the SECs proposed disclosure mandates could quickly become unwise if a companys protective cybersecurity activities are revealed to illicit actors.  How would the SEC balance the details that it seeks to provide investors without arming nation state hackers and their surrogates? It is unclear.  DETECT Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.  • Test and update detection processes—Develop and test processes and procedures for detecting unauthorized entities and actions on the networks and in the physical environment, including personnel activity.  • Maintain and monitor logs— Logs are crucial to identify anomalies in an enterprises computers and applications. Logs record events such as changes to systems or accounts as well as the initiation of communication channels.  The SECs proposal would push companies to disclose whether they take actions to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents.  This line of inquiry would be understandable if responses were limited to review by investors—but bad actors would also get access.  Why would the Commission ostensibly want data on a companys efforts to detect unauthorized entities on its information systems? The rulemaking does not appear to eliminate such a disclosure.  RESPOND Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.  • Ensure response plans are tested—Its important to test response plans to make sure each person knows his or her responsibilities in executing the plan. This includes knowing any legal reporting requirements or required information sharing.  • Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders—Its important to ensure that an enterprises response plans and updates include all key stakeholders and external service providers. They can contribute to improvements in planning and execution.  The Respond function enables a company to contain the effects of a potential cybersecurity incident.  What amount of novel detail would the Commission want a company to reveal regarding its response planning and communications with internal and external stakeholders (e.g., the FBI or the Secret Service)?  Making too much detail available to investors—as well as malicious actors—could prove counterproductive to a companys security and financial performance.  RECOVER Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore • Communicate with internal and external stakeholders—Part of recovery depends upon effective communication. An organizations The SECs rulemaking calls for a company to disclose whether it has business continuity, contingency, 22  any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.  recovery plans need to carefully account for what, how, and when information will be shared with various stakeholders so that all interested parties receive the information they need but no inappropriate information is shared.  • Ensure recovery plans are updated—As with response plans, testing execution will improve employee and partner awareness and highlight areas for improvement. Be sure to update Recovery plans with lessons learned.  and recovery plans in the event of a cybersecurity incident.  This requirement tracks with the CSFs Recover function.  The Commissions 2018 interpretive guidance insists that a company would not need to make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts. Thus, what level of detail does the SEC newly want from a company regarding its business continuity and recovery plans that is doesnt already disclose? If, having read the tables contents, the Commission responds that it does not want companies to disclose as much detail as what is provided here, then many in industry reasonably want to know what the Commission wants from registrants that is substantively different from what the SECs 2018 interpretive guidance calls for. Nevertheless, if the SEC wants a company to provide even more granularity in reports than what the table illustrates, then this level of detail into a companys cybersecurity program would be troubling. No evidence has been put forward by the Commission that such a level of detail would benefit investors or that the benefits would outweigh the potential consequences to companies that are already victims of cybercriminals or nation state actors or their surrogates.  Moreover, there is a discrepancy between the Commissions push for greater company transparency and other federal policymakers stances on protecting government and/or industry cybersecurity programs and activities against cyber intrusions. For example, in July 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued a second security directive (the first one being issued in May 2021) requiring owners and operators of TSA designated critical pipelines to implement specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information technology and operational technology systems, among other measures.27  The security directive is considered sensitive security information (SSI), meaning that its disclosure would be detrimental to the security of transportation, according to the TSA. The directives cover memorandum warns recipients to take special care to safeguard SSI from unauthorized disclosure and limit disclosure to covered persons … to whom access is operationally necessary.28 Additional examples of DHS administered regulations that mandate the protection of cybersecurity related information are the Chemical Facilities Anti Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program and the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA). CFATS information is safeguarded as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information, and MTSA information is safeguarded as SSI.29  The SECs proposed amendments are clearly at odds with the determination of DHS that information about cybersecurity incidents must be kept confidential and not publicly 23  disclosed. It is unclear how the SECs rulemaking would interact with the TSAs security directives and how a company that is also subject to the TSA directive would choose which government regulation to follow.  Posting greater details about a companys relevant cybersecurity policies and procedures on a public internet website is a step that the Commission should not take. Forcing companies to make public sensitive elements about their cybersecurity risk management programs is dangerous, while the benefit to investors is uncertain. The SEC has an obligation to consider both this risk and less costly alternatives for protecting investors.  Public disclosure on whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect registrants selection and oversight of third parties should only be provided at a very high level. Detailed information could have detrimental security implications (e.g., providing a roadmap to vulnerabilities and widespread breaches if malicious actors were to detect certain patterns). Public disclosure should be limited to confirmation that policies and procedures are appropriately applied to third party selection and ongoing oversight as part of a risk based framework covering the relationship life cycle.  Public disclosure should not require detailing the mechanisms, controls, and contractual details used to reduce cybersecurity risks related to providers. Otherwise, doing so could expose a company, its clients, and its employees to additional risk, which is the opposite of what the SEC is seeking in its proposed rules. Further, exposing detailed information could put a company at a competitive disadvantage if its outsourcing policies, procedures, and service provider list is openly disclosed, including being made available to competitors.  7.1.3 Security Concerns Associated With the Public Disclosure of Companies Cybersecurity Plans Would Likely Outweigh the Potential Benefits Energy sector stakeholders, principally the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), have thoughtfully wrestled with questions like 21 and 22. Portions of a 2020 FERC NERC white paper are worth capturing at length because they wrestle with the costs and benefits of public disclosures in the context of cybersecurity. The SEC may find the authors conclusions valuable as it weighs next steps on the proposed cybersecurity rules.  FERC and NERC concluded, Even weighing the assumed benefits of public disclosure articulated by commenters, the principal policy reason for such disclosure—incenting compliance with the CIP [short for Critical Infrastructure Protection] Reliability Standards—is not compelling because section 215 of the FPA relies primarily on the prospect of substantial penalties to incentivize compliance with NERC Reliability Standards, rather than through public scrutiny [italics added].  In a related fashion, the SEC already has tools to address the shortcomings of companies cybersecurity disclosures and enforce against investors who act on insider information. The Commission does not need to expand its reach into companies 26 • Whether and how frequently such persons or committees report to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors on cybersecurity risk.  8.1.1 SEC Micromanagement of Companies Cybersecurity Governance Would Not Advance Investors Interests  The Commission ensures that companies offering securities for sale to the public must tell the truth about their business, the securities they are selling, and the risks involved in investing in those securities. Those who sell and trade securities—brokers, dealers, and exchanges—must treat investors fairly and honestly.32 The SEC has broad regulatory authority over significant parts of the securities industry, although its authority is not unlimited.33 The Commission regulates public companies disclosures—not their activities. Its proposed rules are expressed in regular disclosure language. In practice, however, the rules would push companies in targeted directions regarding the development and execution of their cybersecurity policies, processes, and board composition.  According to some government officials and industry professionals, the proposed rules governance disclosure requirements embody an unprecedented micromanagement by the SEC pertaining to the composition and functioning of both the management and the boards of companies. The proposal would require companies to disclose whether they have a chief information security officer (CISO), his or her relevant expertise, and where the CISO fits in the entitys organization. The proposal would also require granular disclosures about the interactions of management and the board on cybersecurity, including the frequency with which the board and management consider cybersecurity risk and related topics.34  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Commission is trying to stipulate that companies take specific cybersecurity actions. The SEC should not use its disclosure rules to prescriptively influence company activity in this regard; nor should it overstep its disclosure authority. The Commission would be granting itself additional authority to push companies on how they should operate their cybersecurity programs. The Commission should not require disclosures designed to unduly influence company behavior where it does not have such expertise.  The Chamber has been promoting sound cyber risk management practices domestically and overseas for more than a decade. Despite high profile cyberattacks on public and private entities, we have seen a surge of business and government investments and innovations in the field of cybersecurity. Companies, not government, are the main force driving the protection and resilience of U.S. networks and information systems. In our experience, companies are increasingly integrating cybersecurity risk management practices into their corporate cultures. The Chamber wants to see this trend continue. We also want companies and agencies to work together in cyber risk management, not function as adversaries.  The Chamber appreciates the Commissions interest with respect to improving U.S. cybersecurity, but the SEC does not have the optimal homeland security, law enforcement, 27  intelligence, ad national security expertise to play such a role. Many companies are already regulated regarding cybersecurity—quite heavily in many instances—and U.S. government officials are working with companies literally every minute to defend online assets and information.35 The SEC must concede that it is more than a simple pass through for informing investors. As such, the nature of the agencys cybersecurity expertise matters. Instead of taking a regulatory jump, the SEC should work more holistically with other federal agencies that are deeply engaged in cybersecurity matters and partner with companies to craft cybersecurity policies, including ones related to disclosing significant incidents.  8.2 BOARD CYBERSECURITY ‘EXPERTISE  The SEC proposes to amend Item 407 of Regulation S K by adding paragraph (j) to require disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors of the registrant. The Commissions proposed rulemaking says, If any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s) and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.  The Commissions intended requirements would build upon the existing disclosure requirements in Item 401(e) of Regulation S K (business experience of directors) and Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (board risk oversight). The proposed Item 407(j) disclosure would be required in a companys proxy or information statement when action is to be taken with respect to the election of directors and in its Form 10 K.  8.2.1 Cybersecurity ‘Expertise Is Scarce  Further, proposed Item 407(j) would not define what constitutes cybersecurity expertise, given that such expertise could cover different experiences, skills, and tasks. Proposed Item 407(j)(1)(ii) would, however, include the following nonexclusive list of criteria that a registrant should consider in reaching a determination on whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity:  • Whether the director has prior work experience in cybersecurity (e.g., prior experience as an information security officer, security policy analyst, security auditor, security architect or engineer, security operations or incident response manager, or business continuity planner).  • If the director has obtained a certification or degree in cybersecurity.  • Whether the director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity (e.g., in the areas of security policy and governance, risk management, security assessment, control evaluation, security architecture and engineering, security operations, incident handling, or business continuity planning).  Under the SECs rulemaking, proposed Item 407(j)(2) would say that a person who is determined to have expertise in cybersecurity would not be deemed an expert under section 11 of the Securities Act. This proposed safe harbor is intended to clarify that Item 407(j) 28  would not impose any duties, obligations, or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liability imposed on a member of the board of directors. The Commission notes that this provision should help alleviate potential concerns of cybersecurity experts who may be considering board service. The SEC adds that it does not intend for the identification of a cybersecurity expert on the board to decrease the duties and obligations or liability of other board members.  The Chamber welcomes constructive discussions with the Commission on ways to help strengthen the cybersecurity of the business community. We urge private entities, including publicly traded companies, to proactively prioritize cyber risk management activities. However, the Chamber has concerns with the SECs call for companies to disclose the name of any board member who has cybersecurity expertise.  First, board experts should not proliferate via implicit or explicit government directives. From an industry standpoint, the Chamber does not believe that the SEC should give itself the power to dictate or suggest which experts sit on companies governing bodies. This type of broad mandate could easily lead to unwieldy and unintended outcomes and impact other categories of Commission suggested board expertise.  Second, cybersecurity talent is scare globally. From a personnel standpoint, its unclear where companies would get the so called cybersecurity expertise that the proposed regulation would mandate. There is a well documented lack of cybersecurity talent for the public and private sectors that would unquestionably affect companies recruitment of board cybersecurity experts.36 Quality information on this subject is available via CyberSeek, which has produced an interactive heat map with insights into the supply and demand for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S., including data on state and metropolitan areas. According to CyberSeek, there are approximately 598,000 cybersecurity job openings in the U.S. This significant number does not account for workforce shortfalls in other parts of the world.37  It is unlikely that even organizations such as NIST could readily pinpoint what constitutes expertise or experience in cybersecurity that would earn widespread agreement among industry professionals. Advancements in cybersecurity occur rapidly. Overseeing internal and external experts who are current in the field is arguably more valuable than directors having outdated credentials.  Furthermore, the cybersecurity field remains remarkably homogenous, especially in leadership positions. The SEC should consider that cybersecurity board expertise needs to draw from a nondiverse talent pool. There are a growing number of new rules and legislation that call on companies to disclose board diversity, have at least two diverse board members, and/or explain their lack of board diversity.38 An unintended consequence of the SEC proposal is likely to create new barriers for underrepresented groups to move into cybersecurity leadership roles largely due to the expense of obtaining credentials and other formal certifications. The costs associated with obtaining cybersecurity related degrees and other credentials could hinder the advancement of individuals who could otherwise rise through the ranks within the field of cybersecurity. 29 Third, the commission has not provided sufficient evidence that having cybersecurity experts on boards would increase companies cybersecurity postures or advance the SECs mission. Even assuming companies could obtain the relevant cybersecurity experts for board positions, as the Commission proposes, no evidence has been convincingly shown that this requirement would better inform investors or improve companies cybersecurity. Board members, even with cybersecurity expertise, would not be responsible for day to day operations of a company, which is the level at which cybersecurity incidents occur—from social engineering to supply chain attacks.  Under the SECs proposal, investors may see the inclusion of certain individuals on a companys board as an indication of a companys overall cybersecurity program maturity and as a sign that a company is more secure than another one that does not have a board member with cybersecurity expertise. Such an outcome could be misleading to investors. It could create a false sense of confidence among investors because a company without board members with cybersecurity expertise may have an extremely knowledgeable CISO and other staff who carry out day to day operations that defend the companys assets and customers. Meanwhile, the company with a board member with cybersecurity expertise may suffer from poor operational execution of policies and procedures.  The Chamber has a shared interest with the Commission in urging companies governing bodies to prioritize cybersecurity throughout their organizations and with their business partners, but compelling companies to put hard to find cybersecurity experts on their boards, owing to their duties to disclose, is not the optimal way to facilitate this objective or achieve the SECs policy goals.  9. Definitions: ‘Cybersecurity Incident Should Be Narrowed: Overreporting Incidents Would Not Serve Investor Interests  Proposed Item 106(a) defines the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems as used in proposed Item 106 and proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05 as follows:  • Cybersecurity incident means an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.  • Cybersecurity threat means any potential occurrence that may result in, an unauthorized effort to adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.  • Information systems means information resources, owned or used by the registrant, including physical or virtual infrastructure controlled by such information resources, or components thereof, organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of the registrants information to maintain or support the registrants operations. 30 According to the SEC, What constitutes a ‘cybersecurity incident for purposes of our proposal should be construed broadly and may result from any one or more of the following: An accidental exposure of data, a deliberate action or activity to gain unauthorized access to systems or to steal or alter data, or other system compromises or data breaches.  The SECs definition of a cybersecurity incident generally aligns with NISTs definition, which the Chamber looks to for technical authority (see the table below related to NIST terms). For reasons of consistency, federal agencies should avoid defining terms through their own nomenclature. Also, the Chamber believes that cybersecurity incident needs some refinements and boundaries—meaning that it shouldnt be overly elastic—or construed broadly, according to the Commission.  The scope of the SECs definition of a cybersecurity incident is too expansive. Instead, at the time of this writing, the Chamber believes that it should track more closely with Presidential Policy Directive, United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD 41). Material cybersecurity disclosures should correspond to significant incidents that do actual harm. PPD 41 refers to a significant cyber incident as a A cyber incident that is (or group of related cyber incidents that together are) likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.  Companies need clarity in reporting requirements, which should be targeted to well defined and confirmed material cyber incidents. Some legislative and regulatory language that the Chamber has considered—such as potential cyber intrusions and incidents that could be reasonably believed to be reportable—are overly subjective. Material cybersecurity incidents should be attached to clear, objective criteria in any rule that the SEC—with industry input—develops. Getting the definition of a cybersecurity incident right requires more time that the SECs comment period allows.  The definition of a cybersecurity incident should be limited to information systems or resources that are within the companys control. Reportable incidents could involve information resources used by the company even if they are not owned by the company. In many circumstances, it could be difficult, if not impossible, for a registrant to be reasonably able to obtain adequate information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting third party information resources.  A cybersecurity incident, specifically the use of unauthorized access as an element for disclosure review, is excessively broad. It is remote that unauthorized access to a companys information systems alone, without an intent to do wrong, would [jeopardize] the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein. If the Commissions rule is enacted as proposed, it would generate scenarios where nearly every potential breach (e.g., of company policies) or accidental access—regardless of an intent to do harm or any actual resulting harm—would need to be reviewed by a disclosure committee to determine materiality. Some state data breach laws and insurance data security laws provide exceptions for instances of good faith 34 Thank you for the opportunity to provide the Commission with comments on the proposed cybersecurity rules.

It is important to distinguish vulnerability information from incident data. Vulnerabilities are found routinely and mitigated based on industry best practices and international standards for coordinated vulnerability disclosure and handling (CVD).  In general, information concerning vulnerabilities is kept in strict confidence during the CVD process until mitigations are publicly available. This is done to reduce the risk that sensitive information could be exploited by attackers to harm users and the cyber ecosystem.  The practice of maintaining vulnerability information in strict confidence is embodied in international standards for CVD (ISO/IEC 30111, 29147) and endorsed by Congress.

March 9, 2022. https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922  35 For several years, the Chamber has urged agency officials and lawmakers to work to reduce duplicative and overly burdensome information security requirements that impact regulated institutions. To illustrate, a U.S. technology company executive shared with us in 2020 that his firm must comply with approximately 750 data security/cyber regulations globally. And about one third of these mandates change at any given time, this person said. In a similar vein, the authors of the Fifth Domain make a compelling case for wisely pruning the regulatory bushes. They write:  Although [the] Clinton, Bush, and Obama [administrations] eschewed, rejected, or declined to establish a [comprehensive] federal cybersecurity regulatory regime, there is a mountain of cybersecurity regulation created by federal agencies. Banks, nuclear power plants, self driving cars, hospitals, insurance companies, defense contractors, passenger aircraft, chemical plants, and dozens of other private sector entities are all subject to cybersecurity regulation by a nearly indecipherable stream of agencies including the FTC, FAA, DHS, DoD, FERC, DOE, HHS, DOT, OCC, and on and on. Variation in federal regulations should be a result of conscious policy choices, not the incremental accretion of rules written at different times with little central guidance. It is time to step back and assess which of these agencies and regulations have been effective.  39 Richard A. Clarke and Robert K.

The EIC appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (Commission or SEC) request for public comment on the Commissions proposed rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure with respect to public companies subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Proposal).1  EIC writes today to provide the Commission with information regarding the work already being undertaken by EIC and our members to develop effective cybersecurity protections, as well as various comments and recommendations related to the Proposal. I. EIC Members Cybersecurity Efforts and Existing Regulations: The SEC Should Defer to the Primary Regulators of Critical Infrastructure Entities  a. EIC Members Efforts and Existing Regulations EIC and our members recognize the undisputed importance of cybersecurity to our country and economy, and to all public companies and their investors. While the Commission has a role to play with respect to Cybersecurity, we suggest the Commission proceed with caution and refer to existing rules, guidance, regulators, cybersecurity agencies and consumer protection authorities. Given the importance of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, we recommend the Commission consider the practices and procedures already implemented by cybersecurity regulators.  1 See Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; RIN 3235 AM89 (proposed Mar. 9, 2022) (the Proposal). Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  2 Our members have been implementing cybersecurity best practices for years. Many of our members are not only meeting current SEC best practices and guidance, but proactively addressing cybersecurity and investing in extensive cybersecurity protection. EIC and our members are already subject to multiple cybersecurity regulations, and the Proposal may add an administrative burden to our members while providing limited benefit to investors or the registrant. EICs members are subject to numerous regulations and directives related to cybersecurity. Two agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have primary responsibility for pipeline cybersecurity: the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).2 Other federal entities are also engaged with pipeline security, including the Department of Transportations Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which is the nations pipeline safety regulator that partners with TSA on security issues, and the Department of Energys (DOE) Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response office, which is congressionally mandated to research cybersecurity risks and coordinate federal response to energy sector cyber incidents.3  Extensive existing and upcoming regulations already guide EICs members in cybersecurity. CISA has promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Standards that require all high risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with certain regulatory requirements.4 These standards include completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet CISA defined, risk based performance standards.5 In 2021, the TSA initiated a series of Security Directives for the nations most critical pipeline systems, many of which are EIC members. These TSA guidelines include requirements that critical pipeline owners report security incidents to the TSA within 12 hours, comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements.6 Additionally, TSAs current security guidelines include dedicated cybersecurity provisions which state that pipeline operators should consider the approach outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, other guidance issued by DHS and DOE, and industry specific or other established methodologies, standards, and best practices.7 President Biden signed an Executive Order on May 12, 2021, on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity, which primarily focused on improving federal agencies cybersecurity defenses,  2 See Chris Jaikaran, Pipeline Cybersecurity: Federal Programs, Congressional Research R46903 (Sept. 9, 2021), available at https://sgp fas.org/crs/homesec/R46903.pdf.  3 See id. 4 See Chemical Facility Anti Terrorism Standards, CISA, available at https://www.cisa.gov/chemical facility anti terrorism standards.  5 See id. 6 See Ratification of Security Directive Pipeline 2021 01, 86 FR 38209 (July 20, 2021); Ratification of Security Directive Pipeline 2021 02, 86 FR 52953 (Sept. 24, 2021). 7 See National Institute of Standards and Technology, Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1, April 16, 2018; see also Department of Energy, Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) Program, available at https://www.energy.gov/ceser/energysecurity/cybersecurity capability maturity model c2m2 program. Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  3 as well as improving the cybersecurity of the supply chain.8 Then, on July 28, 2021, President Biden released a National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, which directs CISA and NIST to develop and issue performance goals for critical infrastructure owners concerning cybersecurity.9 This memorandum details U.S. policy to safeguard our critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on the cybersecurity and resilience of sectors and systems supporting the functions of government and the private sector so vital that their disruption would have a debilitating effect on our national or economic security or the public health and safety of the American people. The natural gas pipeline sector is one such system. In furtherance of the Presidents focus to improve the safeguards of our critical infrastructure, the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative (Initiative) was established. The Initiative is a voluntary, collaborative effort between the federal government and the critical infrastructure community to facilitate the deployment of technologies and systems that provide visibility, indicators, detections, and warnings of cyber threats that could degrade critical operations. The Initiative also encourages the sharing of threat information with the government to facilitate collective defense. To coordinate natural gas pipeline sector input and effort, the Pipeline Subsector Coordinating Council (PSCC) formed a Natural Gas Pipeline CEO Task Force (Task Force) to work with the federal government in developing and implementing the sector action plan. The Initiative effort for natural gas pipelines began on August 31, 2021. In support of this effort, the Task Force met biweekly with the participation of senior government officials from the National Security Council, the Office of the National Cyber Director, the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Transportation/PHMSA, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Department of Energy. Private sector participation included CEO representation from some of the key companies in the industry. To date, most priority pipelines have deployed or committed to deploy additional cybersecurity technologies. Congress recently passed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, which will require critical infrastructure entities to report material cybersecurity incidents and ransomware payments to CISA within 72 and 24 hours, respectively.10 CISA must promulgate a proposed implementing regulation within 24 months from the final enactment date of March 15, 2022, and a final regulation no later than 18 months thereafter. The Act also calls for harmonization of cybersecurity reporting that would help avoid counter productive and burdensome conflicts and redundancy.  8 Executive Office of the President, Improving Nations Cybersecurity, 86 FR 26633 (May 17, 2021). 9 The White House, Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, NATIONAL SECURITY MEMORANDUM (July 28, 2021), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing room/statements releases/2021/07/28/nationalsecurity memorandum on improving cybersecurity for critical infrastructure control systems/.  10 Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong. (2022). As drafted, the reporting requirements will cover multiple sectors of the economy, including chemical industry entities, commercial facilities, communications sector entities, critical manufacturing, dams, financial services entities, food and agriculture sector entities, healthcare entities, information technology, energy, and transportation.  Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  4 The Proposal justified its overly broad approach to materiality on presumption (without substantiation) that there is currently systematic under reporting of material cybersecurity incidents to investors, stating that certain cybersecurity incidents were reported in the media but not disclosed in a registrants filings.11 However, public companies are already under an obligation to report to investors any material incidents. In 2018, the SEC published a Release titled Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, which emphasized a range of factors that may affect whether an incident should be disclosed to investors beyond the bottom line financial costs to respond to the incident.12 There is no record of public companies  critical infrastructure or otherwise  systematically or regularly failing to provide timely material information to investors about material cybersecurity incidents. The fact that some incidents are reported in the press is not necessarily indicative of their materiality. b. Recommendations EIC recommends that the Commission consider and defer to those entities with primary responsibility over cybersecurity, especially for critical infrastructure entities such as many of EICs members. The Commission should consider an express exemption for reporting by critical infrastructure entities that are actively engaged in addressing an incident with their primary regulators and cybersecurity agencies. The Commission should also rely on existing requirements for public companies to report material events and maintain internal controls as set forth in the Commissions 2018 statement and guidance on public company cybersecurity disclosures13 and 2018 report of investigation concerning cyber related internal accounting controls.14 In the event the Commission proceeds with the Proposal, it should refine its guidance to provide more clear direction about material incidents, and ensure it does not counterproductively induce harmful overreporting (discussed further below). II. Incident Reporting Requirements: The Commission Should Reconsider Its Four day Reporting Deadline and Level of Specificity Required for Material Cybersecurity Disclosures a. The Definition of Materiality Is Not Clear Due to the Provided Examples of Potentially Material Cybersecurity Incidents, and Could Lead to Over Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents The proposed materiality standard is not clear, and it fails to provide sufficient additional guidance on how to make this determination for cybersecurity incidents. The Proposal lacks concrete thresholds to assist registrants in determining materiality. Specifically, many of the examples of material cybersecurity incidents in the Proposal would not constitute a material  11 The Proposal at 52. 12 See Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 17 CFR Parts 229 and 249, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf.  13 Id. 14 Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Regarding Certain Cyber Related Frauds Perpetrated Against Public Companies and Related Internal Accounting Controls Requirements, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 84429 (Oct. 16, 2018), available at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34 84429.pdf.  Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  5 cybersecurity incident if managed through effective incident response, remediation and resiliency. Additionally, it is rare that a cybersecurity incident is immediately apparent as material. While the Proposal does not purport to change the traditional materiality standard for reporting cybersecurity incidents, the SEC appears to be signaling (including by citing examples of some potentially routine types of incidents) that it expects registrants to err on the side of more reporting, and to do so particularly quickly. That is problematic because breaches and cyber events can be notoriously fluid, and a companys early understanding of an incident (and available remediation and resiliency measures) can change significantly (in both directions) during the course of a sophisticated forensic investigation. Moreover, any incident that is potentially material to a public company will very likely involve law enforcement and other government agencies besides the SEC, and various equities and interests will be implicated.  Public disclosure of serious and complex incidents should therefore not be inappropriately rushed.  Furthermore, if registrants are incentivized to report what may be non material incidents early to err on the side of caution, the result may be stock price drops as the market reacts to being informed of putatively material cybersecurity events. However, if in the fullness of time, the incident turns out not to have been material itself, the but for cause of any impact on stock price would be the SEC incentivized (over )reporting.  b. Four days Is a Rigid Timeline that May Not Be Sufficient Time to Fully Understand the Scope of an Incident The Proposal provides some helpful guidelines and flexibility for reporting material cybersecurity incidents. However, requiring registrants to report material cybersecurity incidents four days after determining the incident is material may add an unnecessary burden for registrants, diverting resources to public disclosure of fluid facts in the middle of time sensitive containment and mitigation activities.  For instance, during the first few days of a cybersecurity incident, a company will often initiate an incident response plan and collaborate with forensic experts to: determine the possible attack vectors and any indicators of compromise; gather and review evidence such as system events, logs of affected systems, and other pertinent information; notify any relevant stakeholders and/or fiduciary obligations; contain an ongoing incident such as through isolating compromised networks or systems, closing vulnerable ports and access points, or re routing or filtering network traffic; eradicate a threat such as by removing malware, disabling breached user accounts, or patching vulnerabilities; and monitor for any additional anomalous activity, signs of intrusion, or indicators of compromise. During an incident investigation, a registrants understanding of the incident naturally evolves. Disclosing an incident quickly could cause inadequate reports to be filed, which should not yet be relied upon, and which could lead to media and other questions that distract from core incident response and remediation efforts, as well as investor confusion. Moreover, publicly disclosing information that law enforcement, national security agencies, or regulators could utilize in an investigation could impede the proper course of the investigation and cause Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  6 unintended consequences, such as revealing sensitive information upon which bad actors might act. Other regulators with strict reporting deadlines do not publicly disclose information related to ongoing investigations. Indeed, other regulators that request information on security incidents, such as CISA and the FBI, have stressed that their agencies do not share breach report data with regulatory agencies such as the FTC or SEC.15 The TSA directives related to cybersecurity treat information concerning security incidents as Sensitive Security Information, which is exempt from public disclosure.16 Additionally, the complexity of critical infrastructure incidents often involves extensive interaction, coordination and joint remediation with government regulatory, cybersecurity, law enforcement and homeland/national security agencies, as well as upstream and downstream partners. Requiring disclosure within four days of determining presumptive materiality would disrupt this complex process. Premature public reporting would be in conflict with the principle of responsible disclosure17 and would risk potentially significant adverse consequences for companies, investors, the economy, and safe functioning of societys critical infrastructure. The SECs four day public disclosure proposal does not take this complex and essential balance into account. Finally, the reporting requirements under the Proposal are also not aligned with other federal and state cybersecurity incident reporting requirements. Each registrant has a number of obligations under either federal or state law in the case of a security incident. Several states have security incident reporting rules, each with different variations of timing. Moreover, CISA is currently drafting implementing regulations for critical infrastructure entities after the passing of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. The Proposal would add another compliance burden  with a significantly shorter period of time than most other regulations to report the incident to the public and Commission. The Commission should consider aligning its reporting obligations with other state and federal laws.  Most importantly, the SEC must not require public disclosure while a registrant is involved in complex event management with the government agencies responsible for protecting the nations critical infrastructure where such agencies believe public disclosure would harm the national interest. The Commission must allow delayed public reporting in those circumstances.  Additionally, we foresee threat actors using the knowledge of a companys reporting requirements during an active incident (such as ransomware) as leverage in negotiations with such a company. 15 See Ben Kochman, Biden Cyber Officials Pitch Partnership Amid Hacking Threat, LAW360 (Apr. 22, 2022), available at https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1482974/biden cyber officials pitch partnership amid hacking threat.  16 See Chris Jaikaran, Pipeline Cybersecurity: Federal Programs, Congressional Research R46903 (Sept. 9, 2021), available at https://sgp fas.org/crs/homesec/R46903.pdf; see also 49 C.F.R. §1520. 17 Responsible disclosure entails holding off on public disclosure until the responsible parties have been allowed sufficient time to patch or remediate the vulnerability or issue.

Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  7  c. Public Disclosures of Material Cybersecurity Incidents May Have Severe Security Implications Under the Commissions current Proposal, registrants would be required to publicly disclose certain incidents that are still in the process of being investigated or remediated. The proposed real time and after the fact reporting of cybersecurity incidents could also have the unintended consequence of providing critical information not to investors, but to threat actors in the middle of an attack. Such information could provide the threat actors with an advantage in creating persistence in the network, prolonging an attack, negotiating a ransom, or valuing stolen data on the dark web. Requiring disclosure prior to full remediation may signal to the current threat actor or other bad actors that the registrant continues to have a vulnerability that can be further exploited and may otherwise jeopardize internal remediation efforts. Disclosure prior to remediation may also make the registrant more susceptible to other attacks: while the registrants resources are focused on remediating the disclosed issue, the malefactor or other bad actors may look to attack the registrants environment more broadly in the hope of identifying other vulnerabilities to exploit. Additionally, it is not clear that requiring such detailed disclosures will provide either significant benefits or useful information to investors. d. Form 8 K Should Not Be Expanded to Require Disclosure of Operational Developments in Real Time Cybersecurity incidents are fundamentally different from the types of events covered by existing Form 8 K rules. Mandatory Form 8 K triggers generally cover discrete, clearly identifiable events relating to a companys material transactions, governance or financial position. The occurrence and timing of most 8 K triggers are typically either within the control of the company or reasonably predictable. As acknowledged by the Commission in 2004, reporting on 8 K is intended for unquestionably or presumptively material events.18 Conversely, a cybersecurity attack is by its nature operational, largely outside the companys control and unpredictable, and certainly not unquestionably or presumptively material. Additionally, a cybersecurity incident often takes multiple days or weeks to discover, assess and remediate. When an event is discovered, a companys attention and resources are better fully dedicated to assessing and remediating the event and shoring up protections of the companys systems, all of which are in the best interests of the company and its investors. Given the four day timeline and potential strain on company resources, a company may err on over reporting an incident that appears potentially material depending on what could be learned and the way the incident may unfold, which after a thorough investigation, is determined not material. Existing rules already require companies to apprise investors of a material operational issue, including a material cybersecurity event. A specific, mandatory 8 K trigger for cybersecurity events inappropriately extends the coverage of Form 8 K to the realm of  18 17 C.F.R § 228, 229, 230, 239, 240 and 249 (2004). (Additional Form 8 K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of Filing Date). Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  8 operational developments, which are more appropriately disclosed in periodic reports or voluntary Forms 8 K, at a point when the information is more fully developed and impacts are better understood. As discussed in the SECs 2018 guidance, Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Securities Act prospectus requirements call for disclosure about the material impact of a cybersecurity event, and companies should use Form 8 K to reduce the risk of selective disclosure and the risk of trading on the basis of material nonpublic information.19 III. Board and Governance Requirements Create Undue Administrative Burdens The Proposals Item 106 of Regulation S K and Item 16J of Form 20 F include requirements for registrants to disclose information such as: the cybersecurity expertise of its board members; the registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures; whether it employs a chief information security officer; and the interactions of management and the board of directors concerning cybersecurity. This will create an administrative burden and lead to registrants designing policies and procedures for purposes of SEC reporting rather than broader compliance goals based on risks specific to an organization. Additionally, requiring the disclosure of cybersecurity expertise for a member of the board of directors may be difficult while providing limited benefit to investors. Boards of directors are distinct from management, as the boards role is one of oversight whereas management is required to have subject matter expertise. The board should have the flexibility to determine its own composition, and needs, and take into consideration the collective expertise of the board, holistically. Boards are, by design, deliberative bodies and tasked with oversight of numerous risks  of which cyber is only one of those risks. Current disclosures required concerning boards business experience should be sufficient to elicit relevant information for investors.  IV. Cybersecurity Disclosure Requirements Will Provide a Roadmap for Bad Actors The Proposal may inadvertently lead to cybersecurity incidents. The Proposal will likely lead to registrants disclosing granular and specific details about cybersecurity incidents as well as overly detailed information regarding their cybersecurity governance. Accordingly, the Proposal may provide threat actors with a roadmap to potential vulnerabilities in registrants cyber controls and associate information systems. Prior to engaging with a target, threat actors will often use open source intelligence (OSINT) to learn more about their target.20 We can foresee threat actors using SEC disclosures to target registrants they perceive to have unsophisticated cybersecurity programs. For instance, a threat actor may target a registrant that disclosed that it is in the process of implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures, or a registrant that disclosed that its chief information security officer unexpectedly quit, and the position is currently vacant. Additionally, threat actors may target cybersecurity related personnel that are named in a registrants disclosures. Providing such a roadmap to threat actors  19 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 17 CFR Parts 229 and 249, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf.  20 See Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), CROWDSTRIKE (Feb. 25, 2022), available at https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity 101/osint open source intelligence/.  Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  9 could be particularly problematic for critical infrastructure companies, where such a roadmap could have major economic and national security implications.  V. The Commission Should Consider the Costs of Compliance for the Regulation The Proposal will result in the inevitable duplication with the regulation and responsibilities of more appropriately relevant agencies. EIC members have already substantially invested in cybersecurity compliance and best practices. For example, many EIC members have already invested substantially in complying with existing Pipeline regulations, including the TSAs directives from 2021. This resulting burden and complexity distract cybersecurity professionals from identifying and protecting against the threat environment, while bringing limited benefits to investors as well as to EIC members cybersecurity programs, and providing substantial compliance costs to registrants. VI. Specific Responses to Requests for Comment (RFI) a. RFI 1: We encourage the Commission to reconsider the four day reporting period, as several circumstances may warrant holding off from public disclosure, and the burdens on registrants will vary depending on materiality and any requirements that law enforcement may impose on releasing information.  Specifically, we recommend material cybersecurity incidents be reported as an initial, brief update (assuming approval from law enforcement or relevant cybersecurity or national security agencies), followed by an updated 8 K or 10 Q at a later date. b. RFI 2:  i. We recommend the Commission revise the incident reporting form to include only a general description of an incidents high level details, such as the basic nature, scope and impact of the incident. Proposed Item 1.05 should only cover the basic impact at a high level, and it may be more beneficial to release an initial 8 K with limited information and, if necessary, follow up at a later date with an updated 8 K to the extent important information becomes available or needs to be corrected.  ii. Greater clarity would be helpful for the relevant parameters of materiality in the cybersecurity context. Registrants should be permitted to make their own determination of incidents that rise to the level of notification— and these considerations should include ensuring that any publicly disclosed information does not put the registrant at further risk, and does not confuse investors about the actual investment related significance of an incident. c. RFI 3: Proposed Item 1.05 may have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk. Accordingly, the Commission should limit the information required by proposed Item 1.05 to only cover the basic impact at a high level. Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy | 202.747.6570 10 d. RFI 4: The four day timeline is not enough time to provide a detailed level of information for public disclosure and the Commission should consider modifying the timeframe to an initial, brief update (assuming approval from law enforcement or cybersecurity or national security agencies) followed by an updated 8 K or 10 Q at a later date. e. RFI 5: Yes, the Commission should consider a quantifiable threshold for materiality that would be similar to other financial losses for materiality determinations. We recommend the Commission clarify that a registrants traditional assessments concerning materiality (including available mitigation), and analysis thereof, will continue to apply.  f. RFI 6: Proposed Form 8 K will create a conflict for some critical infrastructure companies with respect to the TSA as well as the upcoming CISA regulations under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. g. RFI 7: Yes, the Commission should allow registrants to delay reporting where the Attorney General (and other prudential cybersecurity regulators) has requested such a delay. h. RFI 8: Yes, the Commission should provide further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination and should include time for registrants to conduct incident response and forensic investigations. The Commission should also consider exemptions for critical infrastructure entities and companies that are collaborating with law enforcement, or other cybersecurity or national security agencies. i. RFI 10: No, registrants would not always be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination concerning cybersecurity incidents. Recent examples of this include SolarWinds, Okta, Log4j, and Microsoft Exchange Server, where registrants may have been dependent on third parties to confirm whether they were impacted. The Commission should consider exceptions for such dependencies.  j. RFI 16: Further clarification is needed on the time period for when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate. How far back would registrants be expected to go? k. RFI 18: Yes, operational technology would be helpful to define. l. RFI 19: Cybersecurity should be defined and should be aligned with the NIST CSF (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover). m. RFI 20: It should be optional for registrants to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal Energy Infrastructure Council | 300 New Jersey Avenue NW | Suite 900 | Washington DC 20001 | www.eic.energy |  11 function or through an external third party service provider. However, registrants should not be required to mention company names or vendors used. n. RFI 21: Registrants should not have to explicitly state that they do not have any established cybersecurity policies and procedures or other comprehensive details concerning companies cybersecurity governance. o. RFI 22: There are concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity. Instead of being prescriptive, we recommend the Commission create a section for registrants to describe their cybersecurity protections as part of their overall risk management program. Many registrants already detail this in their annual report voluntarily. p. RFI 27, 29, 32, and 34: Cybersecurity expertise should be approached the same way it is treated for other specialties, such as accountants, legal, operations, and other areas of expertise. We thank the Commission for the opportunity to provide our thoughts, and respectfully request that the Commission take our recommendations into account when considering the Proposal.

We appreciate and are supportive of the Commissions goal to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity matters by public companies and believe that registrants and investors would benefit from further guidance on this subject. At the same time, in its current form, the proposed disclosure framework is focused almost exclusively on corporate issuers that have operations and businesses, rather than on asset backed issuers that have no such operations or businesses and, as a result, it is not possible to apply the proposed reporting framework to asset backed issuers without significant revisions and clarifications first.  There is nothing in the proposed rules to suggest that, in the context of asset backed securities (ABS) transactions, they would apply to transaction parties other than the asset  1 SFA is a member based trade industry advocacy group focused on improving and strengthening the broader structured finance and securitization market to help its members and public policy makers responsibly grow credit availability for consumers and business across all communities.

We also believe there are meaningful differences between the potential impact of cybersecurity risks and incidents on investors in corporate securities versus ABS. The primary area of potential cybersecurity risk to an ABS transaction relates to the breach of information systems used by a servicer, including the breach of personal information maintained on those information systems, which, depending on the facts and circumstances, could disrupt servicing of the underlying pool assets. In light of these differences, we believe the focus of any proposed cybersecurity disclosure rules for ABS transactions should be on servicers, whose roles in ABS transactions are generally more significant than the roles of other transaction parties and whose cybersecurity vulnerabilities are more likely to be relevant to ABS investors. We urge the Commission to propose rules for asset backed issuers that are better aligned with the disclosure and reporting framework established under Regulation AB and to provide the ABS market with opportunity for public comment on any such proposed rules.  I. Background  As noted by the Commission, there are no disclosure requirements in Regulation S K or S X that explicitly refer to cybersecurity risks or incidents. This is also the case for Regulation AB. Over the past decade, the Commission and its staff (the Staff) have issued interpretive guidance concerning the application of existing disclosure and other requirements under the federal securities laws to cybersecurity risks and incidents.  In 2011, the Staff of the Division of Corporation Finance issued interpretive guidance (the 2011 Staff Guidance), providing the Divisions views concerning operating companies disclosure obligations relating to cybersecurity risks and incidents. In 2018, the Commission issued additional interpretive guidance (the 2018 Interpretive Release and, together with the 2011 Staff Guidance, the Commission Interpretive Guidance), reinforcing and expanding upon the 2011 Staff Guidance to assist operating companies in determining when these disclosure obligations may arise under existing disclosure rules.  While the Commission Interpretive Guidance addressed these disclosure obligations for operating companies, asset backed issuers have adapted that guidance to their transactions when assessing the materiality of cybersecurity risks and incidents in the course of preparing disclosure required in registration statements and prospectuses under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). Many asset backed issuers include enhanced disclosure relating to cybersecurity risks and incidents, based on general principles of materiality as applied in the context of an ABS transaction. While these disclosures vary in their level of detail, they are typically presented as risk factors in the prospectus and address, among other things, how  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 3  cybersecurity risks and incidents may disrupt the servicing and performance of the pool assets.3  In cases where the servicer has experienced a cybersecurity incident, depending on all of the facts and circumstances, the incident may also be disclosed, either in a cybersecurity risk factor or elsewhere in the prospectus, such as in the discussion of the servicers servicing practices.  Depending on the materiality of a cybersecurity incident, this disclosure may address the cause, scope, and impact of the incident, as well as remedial steps the servicer has taken or is taking in response to the incident.  II. Application of Proposed Cybersecurity Reporting Framework to Asset Backed Issuers  A. The Proposed Framework Does Not Take into Account Key Aspects of ABS Transactions That Differentiate Them from Corporate Securities Transactions  On its face, the proposed rules apply to registrants and would, therefore, apply to corporate issuers and asset backed issuers alike, though the proposed rules would include an exception for a narrow subset of these disclosures relating to certain governance matters in cases where the asset backed issuer does not have any executive officers or directors.  The proposed reporting framework does not, however, appear to have been fully fleshed out for asset backed issuers. For example, under Regulation AB, the term asset backed issuer is defined as [t]he depositor for the asset backed securities acting solely in its capacity as depositor to the issuing entity.4 The depositor is, however, often a special purpose vehicle whose activities are typically limited to receiving or purchasing and transferring or selling the pool assets to the issuing entity in connection with one or more securitization transactions. As the depositor neither holds the pool assets nor issues the ABS supported by that asset pool, it would seem that the Commission may have intended the focus of its proposed disclosure rules to be on the issuing entity rather than on the asset backed issuer.5  Even if the Commission did intend to apply its proposed disclosure rules to the issuing entity, that entity is also typically a newly formed special purpose vehicle whose activities are limited to passively owning or holding the pool of [self liquidating financial] assets, issuing the  3 In some cases, where a servicer is an affiliate of the asset backed issuer and is itself a reporting entity (or the subsidiary of a reporting entity), an asset backed issuer may include some disclosures regarding its affiliated servicers cybersecurity risk management. 4 See Item 1101(b) of Regulation AB, Rule 191 under the Securities Act, and Rule 3b 19 under the Exchange Act. 5 We note General Instruction J to Form 10 K, which provides guidance on use of the Form by asset backed issuers and identifies information that may be omitted from the Form and substitute information that is to be included. General Instruction J.(1)(m) provides: If the issuing entity does not have any executive officers or directors, Item 10, Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant, Item 11, Executive Compensation, Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management, and Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, the registrant may omit the information called for by those Items. [Emphasis added.]  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 4  asset backed securities supported or serviced by those assets, and other activities reasonably incidental thereto.6 As a passive special purpose vehicle with no operations or business, the proposed disclosure rules would not seem to be any more relevant to the issuing entity than they would be to the depositor.7  The proposed rule and form changes are also focused almost exclusively on corporate issuers that have operations and businesses, rather than on asset backed issuers that have no such operations or businesses. For example, the proposed rules • Define cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein [emphasis added];  • Define information systems by reference to information resources, owned or used by the registrant [emphasis added];  • Provide for certain disclosures about the issuers cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, such as disclosing the role cybersecurity plays in a companys strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation; and  • Require that the issuers periodic filings reflect any material changes, additions, or updates to previously reported cybersecurity incidents.  As limited purpose or passive special purpose vehicles with limited activities and no operations or businesses, asset backed issuers and issuing entities do not own or use information systems. Consequently, cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance are not relevant to these entities and the rules, as proposed, would not produce meaningful information to investors.  In addition, to effectuate the proposed requirement that the issuers periodic filings reflect any material changes, additions or updates to previously reported cybersecurity incidents, the Commission is proposing conforming changes only to Forms 10 K and 10 Q, not to Form 10 D.  It is not possible, therefore, to apply the proposed reporting framework to asset backed issuers without significant revision and clarification first. 6 See Item 1101(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation AB. 7 As the Commission is aware, because the issuing entity is a passive special purpose vehicle with no operations or business, Regulation AB does not require the issuing entity to comply with the requirements of Item 101 of Regulation S K (Description of Business), Item 407 of Regulation S K (Corporate Governance) or Item 303 of Regulation S K (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, Regulation AB does not require audited financial statements for the issuing entity in either Securities Act or Exchange Act filings.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 5  There is nothing in the proposed rules to suggest that they would apply to transaction parties other than the asset backed issuer or issuing entity and we do not believe it would be appropriate to apply the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework in its current form to such parties. As the Commission is aware, Regulation AB identifies transaction parties that perform various activities related to the ABS transaction, including the ABS sponsor, depositor, issuing entity, servicer, originator, and trustee. Transaction parties support an ABS securitization transaction in different ways, with some whose role is of a narrower scope (such as a trustee) and others whose role generally is of a broader scope (such as a servicer). Some ABS transactions have one servicer while others have multiple servicers or a master servicer and one or more primary servicers or a backup servicer. A servicer may service the entire asset pool or only a portion of the pool. Even among servicers, therefore, they can support an ABS securitization transaction in different ways, some of a broader scope and others of a narrower scope. Servicers may or may not be affiliates of the ABS sponsor, depositor, issuing entity, or one another.  Aside from the depositor, transaction parties are not the issuer of the ABS. They are engaged to perform a designated role with specified duties, they are generally subject to removal for cause, and, while they perform activities that support the transaction in one way or another, they are not an obligor on the ABS. It is extraordinarily unlikely that a transaction partys financial performance or position would be impacted by a cybersecurity incident to such an extent as to impede its ability to perform its duties and responsibilities to the securitization transaction. In the ordinary course, therefore, the financial performance or position of a transaction party is not material to the ABS transaction and Regulation AB does not require information on the financial condition of a transaction party under those circumstances.8  Cybersecurity risks and incidents may disrupt certain activities performed by a transaction party and, as indicated previously, many asset backed issuers currently disclose this risk. However, this risk does not rise to the level that an asset backed issuer should be required to comply with the Commissions proposed cybersecurity reporting framework.  Harmonizing Regulations is of Critical Importance  Finally, any Commission proposal affecting transaction parties would need to be carefully harmonized with the cybersecurity risk and incident disclosure rules and regulations by which many transaction parties must already abide. Regulated financial institutions are subject to other rules and regulations concerning cybersecurity risk and incident disclosure. For example, banks and bank service providers are subject to the Cyber Security Incident Notification final rule published in November 2021 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.9 8 For example, Regulation AB does not require information regarding a servicers financial condition unless there is a material risk that its financial condition could have a material impact on pool performance or performance of the ABS. See Item 1108(b)(4) of Regulation AB. 9 See 12 C.F.R. Part 53, §53.1 et seq.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 6  Cybersecurity Disclosure Framework for ABS Demands Tailored Standards Aligned with Regulation AB  Taking all of this into account, we believe a cybersecurity reporting framework developed for issuers is far too extensive for a party performing activities that support the transaction in one way or another, but where that transaction party is neither the issuer of, nor an obligor on, the ABS. Simply put, while a transaction party may have an important role in a securitization, it is qualitatively different from an issuers role in a corporate securities transaction, and we believe it would be inappropriate to equate the role of any such transaction party with that of an issuer in a corporate securities transaction or, therefore, to apply the same cybersecurity reporting framework to securitization transaction parties as the Commission is proposing to apply to corporate issuers.  We believe our views are also borne out by the existing disclosure standards set forth in Regulation AB, which recognize that the transaction parties have a material role in the ABS transaction but also tailor and limit those disclosure requirements to the capacity in which that party is acting.10 Notably and appropriately, these disclosure requirements do not bear any relationship to the scope and extent of disclosure required of corporate issuers.  The Regulation AB disclosure and reporting regime is also not an integrated regime, meaning that the disclosure standards that apply to Securities Act filings and the reporting standards that apply to Exchange Act reports are almost entirely different and distinct, with virtually no overlap. ABS disclosure in registration forms and prospectuses includes transaction party disclosure while ABS reporting periodic reports does not; instead relating primarily to the reporting of current pool performance and distribution information on the ABS.  If the Commission sought to apply the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework in its current form to one or more of these transaction parties, it would, therefore, represent an extraordinary departure from, and seismic expansion of, the existing disclosure and reporting standards under Regulation AB. We respectfully submit that any departure from the existing disclosure and reporting standards under Regulation AB should be the subject of proposed rulemaking focused on ABS with an opportunity for robust public comment to identify and assess the competing considerations bearing on those disclosure and reporting proposals, including the relative costs and benefits of such proposals.  B. Incident Reporting  As noted above, as part of the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework, the proposed rules would require the registrant to disclose a cybersecurity incident within four business days  10 Regulation AB requires an asset backed issuer to disclose the background and experience of various transaction parties, the nature of their duties and responsibilities under the transaction documents, and certain other targeted matters only when and if they arise, such as the disclosure of any material legal proceedings and the existence of any affiliations, relationships and related transactions. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 7  after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident, pursuant to proposed new Item 1.05 to Form 8 K. The Commission is proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.  If the Commission sought to expand this reporting requirement to cover cybersecurity incidents experienced by another transaction party identified under Regulation AB, asset backed issuers would have several concerns:  First, any such proposal would significantly increase the reporting burden on asset backed issuers as compared with corporate issuers because asset backed issuers would have to attempt to build out policies and procedures to determine whether another transaction party, possibly an unaffiliated party, had experienced a cybersecurity incident, as well as whether the incident was material to the ABS securitization.  Second, asset backed issuers believe it is extremely unlikely that an unaffiliated party would be willing or able to share information about the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident within a timeframe that would meet the proposed filing requirement.11 And, even then, asset backed issuers think the unaffiliated party would be willing or able to disclose only a minimum amount of information about the incident.  Third, assuming the parties were able to move beyond the challenges identified in the preceding paragraphs, the determination of whether a cybersecurity incident experienced by another transaction party was material to the ABS securitization transaction could be difficult to ascertain, particularly if the party experiencing the incident were unwilling or unable to share sufficient information about the nature of the incident to make a materiality determination.  We once again respectfully submit, therefore, that any departure from the existing reporting standards under Regulation AB should be the subject of proposed rulemaking focused on ABS with an opportunity for public comment to identify and assess the competing considerations bearing on those reporting proposals. By way of example only, if the Commission were to propose a reporting requirement for cybersecurity incidents experienced by another transaction party, in addition to addressing the practical challenges outlined above, we believe any such reporting requirement should be qualified to the extent that any information called for regarding the incident is not determined by, or is unavailable to, the asset backed issuer.12  11 To the contrary, asset backed issuers think it is far more likely that an unaffiliated party would be compelled to delay notifying the asset backed issuer of the incident for some period of time for any number of reasons, including to allow adequate time for the unaffiliated party to assess the nature of the incident and make its own materiality determination, and then to obtain the necessary approvals to notify the asset backed issuer of the incident. 12 The Commission adopted such a qualified reporting requirement with respect to Item 6.02 to Form 8 K (Change of Servicer or Trustee). See Instruction to Item 6.02, which provides:  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 8  C. Access to Shelf Registration  The Commissions proposed cybersecurity periodic reporting framework would also include certain corresponding changes to the Exchange Act reporting registrant requirements in Form SF 3. As the Commission knows, these requirements generally require that the depositor and certain affiliates of the depositor be current and timely in their Exchange Act reporting requirements during a 12 month look back period immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement. The requirements currently exclude the reporting of certain reportable events on Form 8 K from the timely reporting requirement, but continue to require that these depositors be current in their reporting requirements. These registrant requirements also require that these depositors other periodic reports (e.g., on Forms 10 D and 10 K) be both current and timely. Finally, these registrant requirements also apply at the time of the depositor registrants annual compliance evaluation under Form SF 3, to determine whether the depositor registrant remains eligible to conduct further takedowns from its effective Form SF 3 registration statement.  If the Commission sought to apply all or any part of the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework to one or another transaction party identified under Regulation AB, the depositor registrants access to shelf registration  both at the time a Form SF 3 registration statement is initially filed and at the time of its annual compliance evaluation for continued access to an effective Form SF 3 registration statement  could depend on whether one or another unaffiliated transaction party provided required cybersecurity disclosures in a timely manner. We respectfully submit that a loss of access to shelf registration due to circumstances entirely outside the control of the asset backed issuer would be punitive in nature and unlike any potential consequence a corporate issuer would face under the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework. This is another significant reason why the Commission should not proceed to adopt rules applying the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework to asset backed issuers without proposing rules in this area focused specifically on ABS.  D. Any Rulemaking Should Apply Prospectively  Any Commission rulemaking that impacts asset backed issuers must distinguish between asset backed issuers whose reporting obligations arose by virtue of ABS that were issued prior to the compliance date(s) for any such new rules (legacy ABS), as compared with asset backed issuers whose reporting obligations will arise by virtue of ABS that will be issued after any such compliance date(s).13 Thousands of registered legacy ABS issuances, each by a separate asset backed issuer, have been completed over a period of many years and are currently outstanding.  These asset backed issuers completed those legacy ABS issuances on the basis of a regulatory  To the extent that any information called for by this Item regarding such servicer or trustee is not determined or is unavailable at the time of the required filing, the registrant shall include a statement to this effect in the filing and then must file an amendment to its Form 8 K filing under this Item 6.02 containing such information within four business days after the information is determined or becomes available. 13 This distinction between legacy ABS and newly issued ABS applies equally to asset backed issuers that are amortizing trusts or revolving master trusts.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 9  framework that did not include cybersecurity reporting requirements. For the vast majority of these issuances, the related transaction documents do not contain provisions that would support reporting in accordance with a prescribed cybersecurity reporting framework, or that would provide for the funds necessary to cover the costs of reporting in such a manner. It is imperative, therefore, that any Commission rulemaking that proposes cybersecurity reporting requirements for asset backed issuers exclude legacy ABS from these additional reporting requirements.  E. Inline XBRL Would Raise Compliance Implementation Costs While ABS Investors Dont Use It  The Commission is proposing to require registrants to tag the information specified by Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S K in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL) in accordance with Rule 405 of Regulation S T.14 If asset backed issuers were excluded from the proposed tagging requirements, they would submit any required cybersecurity disclosures in unstructured HTML or ASCII.  As the Commission notes, asset backed issuers are not subject to Inline XBRL requirements in Commission filings and would incur initial Inline XBRL compliance implementation costs, such as the cost of training in house staff to prepare filings in Inline XBRL and the cost to license Inline XBRL filing preparation software from vendors. Some asset backed issuers are, but many others are not, affiliated with registrants that are subject to Inline XBRL requirements. For those asset backed issuers that have such affiliates, we do not believe the asset backed issuers would be able to leverage those affiliates existing Inline XBRL tagging experience and software in a manner that would significantly mitigate these initial Inline XBRL implementation costs. For those asset backed issuers that have no such affiliates, the initial compliance implementation costs will likely be even higher.  Given the nature of our comment, questions, and concerns regarding the proposed rules, it is difficult to fully assess the Commissions proposal to require the cybersecurity disclosures to be presented in Inline XBRL. Similarly, in light of our comments, we believe any rules the Commission proposes for ABS must first be better aligned with the disclosure and reporting framework established under Regulation AB. Notably, however, ABS investors do not use (or seek to use) Inline XBRL in connection with their review of ABS disclosure and, as such, we believe the perceived benefits of such tagging in the ABS market would be negligible and would be far outweighed by the costs that asset backed issuers would incur. 14 The Commission indicates that an Inline XBRL requirement would allow investors to extract and search for disclosures about cybersecurity incidents reported on Form 8 K, updated information about cybersecurity incidents reported in a registrants periodic reports, a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures, managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, and the board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risk and cybersecurity expertise rather than having to manually run searches for these disclosures through entire documents.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 10  III. Certain Considerations in Proposing Cybersecurity Disclosure Rules for Asset Backed Issuers  As indicated above, there are a number of threshold issues with applying the proposed cybersecurity reporting framework to asset backed issuers because the framework does not take into account key aspects of ABS transactions that differentiate them from corporate securities transactions. If the Commission seeks to adopt cybersecurity disclosure rules for ABS transactions, we urge the Commission to propose rules that are better aligned with the disclosure and reporting framework established under Regulation AB and to provide the ABS market with opportunity for public comment on any such proposed rules. We urge the Commission to consider the following in formulating any such proposed rules:  Cybersecurity Disclosure for ABS Transactions Should Focus on Servicers: We believe there are meaningful differences between the potential impact of cybersecurity risks and incidents on investors in corporate securities versus ABS and that the primary area of potential cybersecurity risk to an ABS transaction relates to the breach of information systems used by a servicer, including the breach of personal information maintained on those information systems, which, depending on the facts and circumstances, could disrupt servicing of the pool assets. We believe, therefore, that the focus of any proposed cybersecurity disclosure rules for ABS transactions should be on servicers, whose roles in ABS transactions are generally more significant than the roles of other transaction parties and whose cybersecurity vulnerabilities are more likely to be relevant to ABS investors.  Among Servicers, Cybersecurity Disclosure Should Focus on Primary Servicers and Should be Principles Based: As described earlier in this letter, some ABS transactions have one servicer while others have multiple servicers or a master servicer and one or more primary servicers or a backup servicer. A servicer may service the entire asset pool or only a portion of the pool. Servicers may or may not be affiliates of the ABS sponsor, depositor, issuing entity, or one another. A servicers role may be broader in scope and include responsibility for management or collection of the pool assets and making allocations or distributions to holders of the ABS, or may be considerably narrower in scope and include only a specific aspect of the servicing function, such as that of a master servicer that may aggregate collections on the pool assets from one or more primary servicers or, alternatively, provide oversight of those activities by the primary servicer(s), in which case the master servicer has no responsibility for management or collection of the pool assets and instead simply monitors the primary servicers and maintains reports to investors that include information on pool performance and distribution information on the ABS.15 15 In some cases, such as in repackaging transactions where the asset pool may be comprised of a single bond issued by an underlying corporate, municipal, or other obligor, there may be one transaction party, such as a trustee, whose role is extraordinarily narrow and involves serving as a passive recipient for distributions on the underlying bond and allocating and distributing the same to the ABS investors. In these cases, the transaction party may technically be a servicer as defined in Regulation AB, but the servicing function entails little more than that of a paying agent for the ABS.  Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 11  Given this variability in the nature and scope of servicing across ABS transactions, we believe any proposed cybersecurity disclosure rules should apply only to primary servicers16 and should be principles based, to allow asset backed issuers to adapt the disclosure standards to the context of their particular transaction structure. Any proposed rule should explicitly indicate that the level of disclosure will depend on, among other things, the nature and scope of the servicers servicing activities in the ABS transaction.  Cybersecurity Disclosure Should Focus on Material Risks and Risk Management and Should Apply to Securities Act Disclosure Documents: Any proposed rules for ABS transactions should focus on material cybersecurity risks and related risk management, based on principles of materiality as applied in the context of an ABS transaction, but should not extend to matters of cybersecurity strategy or governance. In their current form, the proposed rules are far too extensive for a servicer, which performs activities that support the transaction but is neither the issuer of, nor an obligor on, the ABS.  The focus should also be on disclosure contained in Securities Act registration statements and prospectuses, rather than in ongoing Exchange Act reports. As indicated above, unlike the disclosure and reporting framework for corporate issuers, Regulation AB is not an integrated disclosure and reporting framework. It would simply be too significant of a departure from the existing framework, and too burdensome on asset backed issuers, to impose ongoing reporting requirements relating to the cybersecurity readiness of any transaction party, including servicers.  Cybersecurity Incident Reporting: If the Commission were to propose a reporting requirement for cybersecurity incidents in ABS transactions, the focus should be on the same category of servicers as outlined above for Securities Act disclosure and the reporting rule should once again be principles based, to allow asset backed issuers to adapt the reporting standard to the context of their particular transaction structure. Equally important, however, any proposed rules for incident reporting must take into account the practical challenges faced by asset backed issuers, as outlined in Section II.B. above, and the implications of any such reporting requirement on asset backed issuers ongoing access to shelf registration, as outlined in Section II.C. above.  In cases where a servicer is not an affiliate of the sponsor, depositor or issuing entity, we believe a necessary, but not sufficient, element of any solution to these challenges would be to qualify such reporting requirement to the extent that any information called for regarding the incident is not determined by, or is unavailable to, the asset backed issuer. We also believe any information disclosed in such cases should be qualified by the knowledge of the registrant. In addition, in cases where information about a servicers cybersecurity incident is required in an asset backed issuers Exchange Act report and the servicer is itself a reporting entity (or a consolidated subsidiary of a reporting entity), we believe the Commission should provide a  16 As the Commission is aware, Regulation AB currently draws distinctions in the level of disclosure required depending on whether the servicer services less than 10%, between 10% and 20%, or 20% or more of the pool assets. Regulation AB requires considerably less disclosure for servicers that service less than 20% of the pool assets. Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 mechanism whereby, in lieu of including such info1mation, the asset backed issuer is permitted to refer to the Exchange Act repo1is of the servicer (or its reporting parent company). 17 Legacy ABS Should Be Excluded from Additional Cybersecurity Reporting Requirements: As indicated in Section II.D. above, it is imperative that any Commission rnlemaking that proposes cybersecurity repo1iing requirements for asset backed issuers exclude legacy ABS from these additional repo1iing requirements. Transition Period: Asset backed issuers will need time to build out processes by which to prepare enhanced cybersecurity disclosure in Securities Act registration statements and prospectuses, as well as to establish policies and procedures to dete1mine whether an unaffiliated servicer has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. We will be able to fo1m ulate a more accurate assessment of the time that will be required upon reviewing proposed rnles focused on ABS transactions. Preliminarily, assuming the Commission were to propose and, ultimately, adopt rnles for ABS transactions that align with our comment letter, we believe asset backed issuers would need a transition period of at least six months after the effective date for any such rnles in their final fonn before they could comply. * * * * * SF A ve1y much appreciates the oppo1iunity to provide the foregoing comments in response to the Commissions Proposing Release.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street N.E.  Washington, DC 20549 Re: File Reference No. S7 09 22; Request for Public Input on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (SEC Release No. 33 11038; the proposed rule) Dear Ms. Countryman:  Deloitte & Touche LLP is pleased to respond to the Commissions March 9, 2022, request for public input on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure. We appreciate the opportunity to provide observations from our role in the capital markets (e.g., current practices, company readiness, and key drivers of decision useful disclosure) that may be helpful to the Commission as it considers the next steps for the proposed rule, as well as to suggest certain areas where we believe that clarification could assist issuers in providing consistent and comparable information to investors. OBSERVATIONS FROM OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS While executives, boards, and audit committee members generally acknowledge the increasing importance of cybersecurity matters, in our work with companies within the capital markets, we have observed a wide variation in where companies are on the journey to integrate cybersecurity considerations into their enterprise risk management system, strategy, and core business activities. We have also seen significant variation in what each company measures and reports. Many issuers have a robust infrastructure to identify, define, measure, and communicate cybersecurity matters while certain other issuers may still be developing and implementing cybersecurity infrastructure into core business functions. As the Commission moves forward in addressing cybersecurity matters in its disclosure regime, it will be important to consider these variations among companies, and how they may affect the ability to elicit useful, reliable, and comparable cybersecurity disclosure across all SEC reporting companies.  Our observations about the variation in company practice on cybersecurity reporting matters include the following: 2  1. Issuers face challenges in assessing cybersecurity incidents at third party service providers (TPSPs).  Issuers will have to rely on TPSPs to provide timely and complete information on cybersecurity incidents to meet their disclosure requirements under the proposed rule. This will require that the TPSPs also have a robust infrastructure to identify, define, measure, and communicate cybersecurity matters. The responsibility for identifying, notifying, and remediating cybersecurity matters at the third party may rest with the TPSP if this is specified in the contractual arrangement with that TPSP. However, there is a risk, not completely within an issuers control, that the TPSP (1) may not notify an issuer of an incident, (2) may not communicate timely, or (3) may not provide sufficient details on the incident to allow the issuer to evaluate the risk and/or materiality of the incident or the related remediation process. Further, many TPSPs involve other subservice organizations in the delivery of their services. This adds another layer between the issuer and the service organization in terms of obtaining information on an incident.  Certain TPSPs and subservice organizations may be receiving Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports, which include an independent attestation covering the controls over issuers data at such TPSPs. However, not all companies receive such reports, and there are limitations regarding their use. For example:  • SOC 1 reports focus on internal controls over financial reporting and therefore would not provide a complete picture of controls over relevant information given the breadth of the cybersecurity disclosures.  • SOC 2 reports focus on operational objectives and have specific requirements that cover the Trust Services Criteria1 (including up to five categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and/or privacy) and therefore may need to be enhanced to include controls over these specific disclosures.  • Both SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports are typically issued annually, which may not be timely enough for issuers.  • It may also be difficult for an issuer to use the information in a SOC report to evaluate immaterial incidents in the aggregate because SOC reports are presented from the TPSPs perspective and are the same whether issued to a multi billion dollar large accelerated filer or smaller reporting company.  Given the challenges inherently involved in obtaining timely and decision useful information from TPSPs, we would suggest that the Commission consider whether providing issuers  additional transition time to comply with the requirements to disclose incidents at TPSPs would allow issuers to enhance the reporting infrastructure with TPSPs through updated contractual provisions or other appropriate means.  1 See the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy, available at https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/trust services criteria.pdf  3  2. Issuers may not currently have cyber incident tracking systems designed to support the aggregation of all immaterial incidents.  As noted above, we have observed varying degrees of sophistication of cybersecurity programs and protocols. While many issuers have a robust infrastructure to identify and communicate cybersecurity matters, certain, less mature issuers may still be developing and incorporating cybersecurity infrastructure into core business functions. Even issuers with mature systems may not have currently designed them to retain details about immaterial cyber incidents. If the final rule retains the requirement to aggregate immaterial cyber incidents and report them when they become material in the aggregate, issuers may need additional time to implement system functionality to support this requirement. Further, issuers may also require further guidance on how to perform this aggregation (e.g., the period over which the information related to immaterial incidents must be retained and assessed). Refer to our observations in Additional Clarity to Drive Consistent, Comparable, and Reliable Disclosure below. 3. Cybersecurity has been an area of increasing focus for boards and there are a variety of ways boards exercise their oversight of this area.  We have observed that oversight of cybersecurity is an increasing area of focus for boards and agree with the Commission that such oversight is a critical aspect of governance. For example, a January 2022 survey of 246 audit committee members conducted by Deloitte and the Center for Audit Quality showed that of those overseeing cybersecurity, two thirds expected to spend more time on the topic in the coming year.2 We have also observed that there are a variety of board oversight structures, the most effective of which are tailored to the needs of the company (e.g., taking into account industry, company structure, company maturity). For example, in the Deloitte/CAQ audit committee survey, approximately half of the respondents reported that the audit committee is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity. In other companies, we have observed that board oversight of cybersecurity may rest with the full board or with another committee (e.g., a risk or technology committee).  We agree with the Commission that board understanding of critical oversight topics is important, including making sure that the CEO hires an experienced C suite that understands the boards role and how to inform and discuss strategic topics with the board. A board must be informed and knowledgeable enough to advise and challenge management in all areas of its oversight. Boards themselves acknowledged this need,3 and many use a matrix to define and identify the skills, experiences, and diversity needed to execute their duties effectively. We have observed that upon identifying needed skills, boards can gain such skills in numerous ways,  including by recruiting members with specific experience or by educating existing board members individually or collectively.  We note that in addition to proposing required disclosure about whether any member of a companys board has cybersecurity expertise, the Commission recently proposed similar  2 See Deloittes and the Center for Audit Qualitys jointly published Common Threads Across Audit Committees: https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/center for board effectiveness/articles/audit committee practices report.html?id=us:2em:3na:acb:awa:boardef:020222:mkid K0148184&ctr=frcta2&sfid=0033000000QOgmZAAT.  3 In the Deloitte/CAQ survey, 41 percent of respondents indicated that the audit committee needed more cyber expertise (more than in any other risk area).  4  disclosure related to board expertise in climate related risks.4 We believe dedicated expertise may be valuable for some companies. In general, however, especially given the limited size of boards,5 it may not be practical or advisable for a board to recruit dedicated experts in each of its critical oversight areas. While we recognize that neither of the proposals requires designated board experts, we believe that, especially when read together, some may infer that the Commission prefers that issuers identify such experts. We therefore encourage the Commission to consider whether existing proxy rules (which require disclosure of the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills of board nominees), when combined with disclosure regarding board oversight of a companys cybersecurity risk, may be sufficient to inform investors about the role of the board in cyber risk management, without a separate requirement to identify cybersecurity experts.  ADDITIONAL CLARITY TO DRIVE CONSISTENT, COMPARABLE, AND RELIABLE DISCLOSURE The quality, transparency, relevance, and comparability of cybersecurity disclosures can be enhanced by the application of established standards and frameworks. We have identified several elements of the proposed rule that may benefit from additional clarity and thus help the Commission achieve its goal of eliciting consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure.  Terminology Definitions We propose that the Commission consider clarifying certain terminology within the proposed rule, including any information in the definition of cyber incidents and any potential occurrence in the definition of cybersecurity threats. As written, the term any implies considering each and every instance in which either an incident or threat may exist. This broad definition may be applied inconsistently among issuers. While issuers may need to establish a framework to exercise judgment in evaluating incidents, further guidance regarding whether a de minimis concept could apply may assist issuers in focusing on cybersecurity incidents or threats that are more relevant to the organizations purpose and strategy, thereby providing more decision useful information to investors. The Commission may consider whether there should be tiers of important information and describe the impact on the issuers evaluation for each tier level. For example, the issuer could apply a risk assessment approach that distinguishes between crown jewel information such as strategic intellectual property and personally identifiable information (PII) from lower risk information such as informational data or non PII internal records that can easily be reproduced. Clarifying the types of information that would be evaluated within the definition of a threat or incident may assist an issuer in focusing disclosure on the information most useful for investors. We have also considered the intersection of this release and the release Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment Companies, and Business Development Companies (Release No. 33 11028) and would like to highlight that there are certain additional terms defined in Release No. 33 11028 that were not defined in the proposed rule. Thus, we would suggest that the Commission consider whether the defined terms should be consistent. For example, Release No. 33  4 See The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors (SEC Release No. 34 94478; File No. S7 10 22, available at: https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11042.pdf).  5 According to the 2021 U.S. Spencer Stuart Board Index (available at https://www.spencerstuart.com/ /media/2021/october/ssbi2021/us spencer stuart board index 2021.pdf) S&P 500 boards range in size from 5 to 22 members, and average 10.8 directors; 71 percent of boards fall into in the 9 to 12 member range. 5  11028 includes definitions of adviser information, cybersecurity risk, and cybersecurity vulnerability, but these terms or their equivalents are not defined in this proposed rule. Appropriate SEC Form for Disclosure It is not unusual for the investigation into a material incident to take months and for facts to develop or become known over the period of investigation. Footnote 69 of the proposed rule states:  Notwithstanding proposed Item 106(d)(1), there may be situations where a registrant would need to file an amended Form 8 K to correct disclosure from the initial Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such as where that disclosure becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments regarding the incident. For example, if the impact of the incident is determined after the initial Item 1.05 Form 8 K filing to be significantly more severe than previously disclosed, an amended Form 8 K may be required.  We suggest the Commission consider clarifying when material changes, additions, or updates in a cybersecurity incident should be updated via Form 8 K as opposed to a periodic filing. This could include clarifying whether a Form 8 K amendment, rather than an update in a periodic filing, would be required when a material increase in scope and/or severity is uncovered as an investigation into an incident progresses. For example, assume a cybersecurity incident is identified as materially impacting an issuers systems in one country and that incident was disclosed in Form 8 K. Subsequently, the issuer determines that multiple countries are materially impacted. Is an issuer required to report such development in Form 8 K to correct disclosure . . . that becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments or is such a development considered an update to the previously disclosed information?  Framework for Aggregating Immaterial Cybersecurity Incidents We suggest the Commission consider establishing a framework for aggregating a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents to determine when they may become material in the aggregate. A framework for aggregation may assist in ensuring comparability and consistency across issuers and enhance the usefulness of such information for investors. More specifically, the Commission may consider addressing the following questions within an aggregation framework:  • Would aggregation restart each annual period or begin on some other date such as inception of the company, from an initial registration statement, or some other defined period? Further, would there be a cutoff date or period specified? • Should immaterial incidents be categorized by some defining characteristic when assessing aggregation (e.g., type of incident, system impacted, method of attack)?  • Should remediated, immaterial incidents be removed from the aggregation analysis? If so, when?  • How long should such disclosure be maintained in a periodic report once it has been included?  • How would subsequent immaterial incidents be evaluated once disclosure of such incidents in the aggregate is presented? In evaluating these points, the SEC may consider the application of other SEC rules that provide a framework for disclosure requirements when events aggregate to a defined level, such as that in Regulation S X Article 3 05, Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired or to Be Acquired, which requires assessment of individually insignificant acquisitions for an issuers fiscal year typically up to the 6  point of its next 10 K filing. Further, the SEC may also consider providing examples of how the framework is applied, if aggregating immaterial incidents with different defining characteristics is required (i.e., a phishing incident and malware attack) so that issuers may apply the framework consistently, using common parameters. Transition Provisions and Scalability As highlighted above, the level and sophistication of cybersecurity reporting structures varies by issuer, and, if the proposed rule were finalized as written, many issuers may need to invest further in their cyber tracking and disclosure systems to meet certain new disclosure requirements. We have observed that larger issuers may currently have systems in place to track some of this information for disclosure more readily, while smaller issuers may require significant investment to implement systems that perform the detailed tracking and evaluation necessary for some disclosures, such as aggregation. Further, issuers that are more prepared to identify and investigate incidents may disclose incidents earlier than those that are less prepared, which may skew information available to investors and cause them to potentially view as more favorable an issuer that has not disclosed a cyber incident because it lacks the resources to identify it. Therefore, we suggest the Commission consider outreach to issuers on the need for extended transition provisions or a phased implementation process by registrant tier to give issuers more time to prepare to provide certain disclosures and, ultimately, produce more consistent, decision useful disclosures.  * * * * Given the widespread impact that cybersecurity incidents can have, it becomes increasingly important for investors to seek disclosure about such matters to understand how companies are prepared for such disruptions. We commend the Commission for its timely focus on this area. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspectives on the proposed rule.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. CTIA1 welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC or Commission) proposed rules on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosures (NPRM).2 CTIA provides comments to share concerns specific to the communications sector, which faces longstanding reporting obligations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), emergent incident reporting regulations from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and prior SEC regulation and guidance about cybersecurity. As the SEC considers potential rules in this area, we encourage the agency to consider the substantial overlap and compliance challenges that its proposal will create for companies in the communications sector. As detailed below, the communications sector is on the front lines of cyber risk management, engaging in industry based initiatives and working with government to promote secure communications networks and educate consumers about cyber risks. CTIA and its members provide innovative communications services that depend on trust in privacy and security. The sector was an early adopter of cyber best practices and partnerships, and industry proactively identifies, prevents, and remediates threats. CTIAs Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) brings together all sectors of wireless—service providers, manufacturers, and wireless data, internet, and applications companies—to facilitate innovation and cooperation in  1 CTIA® (www.ctia.org) represents the U.S. wireless communications industry and the companies throughout the mobile ecosystem that enable Americans to lead a 21st century connected life. The associations members include wireless carriers, device manufacturers, suppliers as well as apps and content companies. CTIA vigorously advocates at all levels of government for policies that foster continued wireless innovation and investment. The association also coordinates the industrys voluntary best practices, hosts educational events that promote the wireless industry, and co produces the industrys leading wireless tradeshow.

Through the CSWG, CTIA and its members engage in security policy discussions at the federal level and collaborate with federal partners, including the FCC, DHS, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the White House. CTIAs Privacy Working Group similarly brings together stakeholders to address data privacy. Additionally, CTIA has launched several initiatives that support secure wireless technologies.3 CTIA also participates in public private partnerships that promote security across industry and government. These include:  The Communications Information Sharing and Analysis Center, in which CTIA and its members partner with each other and government to share information, identify best practices, and address threats and incidents in real time.4  The FCCs Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council, which provide[s] recommendations to the FCC regarding ways the FCC can help to ensure security, reliability, and interoperability of communications systems.5  DHS Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Task Force, which was spearheaded by CTIA and several member companies and addresses cyber threats to ICT supply chains through a collective defense approach . . . bringing together industry and government to identify challenges and devise workable solutions.6  3 For example, CTIAs Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Certification Program establishes an industry baseline for device security on wireless networks and builds off of widely adopted cybersecurity standards from NIST and the International Organization for Standardization, among others. See Cybersecurity Certification Program for IoT Devices, Version 1.5, CTIA at 30 (Sept. 2021), available at https://ctiacertification.org/wp content/uploads/2021/09/CTIA Cybersecurity Certification Program for IoT Devices V 1 5.zip.

Public communications companies make appropriate disclosures about governance and incidents, consistent with SEC guidance and informed by SEC enforcement priorities. They participate in robust Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance efforts. Aspects of their cyber practices are overseen by state and federal agencies, from the FCC, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and SEC to the New York State Department of Financial Services and other regulators. Drawing from experience defending customers and their networks, managing compliance programs, and as targets of malicious cyber attacks, CTIA and its members urge the SEC to reconsider its proposed cybersecurity disclosure rules. In particular, the incident disclosure mandate as proposed is likely to generate confusion in the marketplace, increase cyber risk to regulated companies, and have other unintended consequences, given that the proposed timeline is very short with little flexibility. The proposed mandate will also overlap and may conflict with comprehensive regulatory efforts being undertaken at the direction of Congress, and should be reviewed to permit harmonization and deconfliction. Additionally, the SEC should reconsider its proposed governance rules, which do not account for the varied needs of companies in diverse industries. CTIA therefore respectfully urges the SEC to reconsider the proposed rules, or in the alternative, modify them to promote harmonization with existing regimes and reduce the risk of premature disclosures that could undermine investigations and lead to market confusion. II. THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS A LEADER IN CYBERSECURITY AND ALREADY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CYBERSECURITY RISK AND INCIDENTS.  Companies in the wireless industry prioritize provision of cybersecurity risk and incident information to customers and the public, sharing information under existing legal regimes and on their own accord to promote customer trust and safety. The wireless industry is also regulated by the FCC, in several relevant respects. Wireless carriers are subject to the FCCs rules requiring  4  agency, law enforcement, and customer notification after unauthorized access to customer proprietary network information (CPNI).7 In addition to FCC requirements, wireless carriers comply with disclosure obligations under state law, which may require notices to individual consumers and state regulators.8 Providers are also subject to FCC reporting requirements regarding network outages.9 The SEC premises its new rule proposal on the belief that investors would benefit from more timely and consistent disclosure about material cybersecurity incidents and companies cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices.10 Public wireless carriers make robust disclosures about cyber incidents and forward looking risk management in SEC filings. These issues are front of mind for the wireless industry, which aims to educate consumers about cyber risk, assure the public of the security of networks—which is an imperative in the competitive wireless market—and communicate information about cyber events when they occur. These disclosures are robust; a Moodys report cited by the SEC found that telecommunications and media companies, along with banks, had the most thorough disclosures in SEC filings on cybersecurity.11 The public may also learn about cyber incidents in the wireless industry through news reporting, information issued by impacted organizations, and state Attorneys General.12 7 47 C.F.R. § 64.2011. 8 See, e.g., N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 899 aa(2) (requiring notice to individuals); Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(f) (requiring notice to state Attorney General). 9 47 C.F.R. § 4.9. 10 Proposed Rule at 16,593.  11 Research Announcement: Cybersecurity disclosures vary greatly in high risk industries, Moodys Investors Service (Oct. 3, 2019), https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys Cybersecurity disclosures vary greatly in high risk industries PBC 1196854; Proposed Rule at n.34. 12 E.g., Data Security Breaches, Delaware Department of Justice, https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/fraud/cpu/securitybreachnotification/ (last visited Apr. 18, 2022); Maryland Information Security Breach Notices, Maryland Attorney General,  5  Beyond disclosing incidents, CTIA and its members take seriously the need to inform and educate the public on how carriers address cyber risk and how customers can protect themselves.  CTIA publishes consumer resources on protecting networks and devices.13 AT&T provides resources to help customers understand cyber risk and safeguard their sensitive data, as well as a yearly report on cybersecurity trends.14 Verizon issues a yearly Data Breach Investigations Report to help organizations protect themselves from security threats.15 T Mobile educates consumers on online safety and identity theft protection, and compiles resources for consumers impacted by online fraud.16 These and other resources provide timely and consistent public information about cybersecurity risks and threats and the wireless industrys risk management and cybersecurity governance practices, making additional requirements unnecessary.  III. THE SEC SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS PROPOSED INCIDENT DISCLOSURE RULES, WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARY IN LIGHT OF EXISTING INCIDENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND NEW RULES BEING CREATED AT THE DIRECTION OF CONGRESS. A. The SECs Current Regime Promotes Transparency on Cyber Incidents, Making New Disclosure Rules Unnecessary.  The SECs current reporting regime appears to be sufficient to achieve the goals outlined in the NPRM. As the SEC acknowledges in the NPRM,17 the SEC has issued multiple guidance documents in recent years making clear the disclosure obligations of public companies with  https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/IdentityTheft/breachnotices.aspx (last visited Apr. 18, 2022). 13 Protecting Your Data, CTIA, https://www.ctia.org/protecting your data.  14 Privacy Center, AT&T, https://about.att.com/privacy html; AT&T Cybersecurity Insights™ Report: Securing the Edge, AT&T, https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource center/industry reports/cybersecurity insights report eleventh edition.  15 Data Breach Investigations Report 2021, Verizon, https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/.  16 Privacy Center: Resources for identity theft and internet fraud prevention., T Mobile, https://www.t mobile.com/privacy center/education and resources/online safety.  17 Proposed Rule at 16,593.  6  respect to cybersecurity incidents.18 Pursuant to this guidance, companies routinely make disclosures after a material incident. Under its current rules, the SEC is empowered to police the adequacy of disclosures. Indeed, it frequently engages in investigations and has pursued related enforcement actions.19 B. The SECs Proposed Disclosure Regime Would Add Complexity to an Already Fragmented Landscape.  The current incident reporting landscape for companies is fragmented and complex.  There are multiple incident reporting and notification requirements that publicly traded companies comply with—at both the state and federal level. To begin with, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have breach notification laws.20  These laws require notice directly to consumers, and in many cases, to state regulators.21 At the federal level, several requirements exist, and more are emerging. This creates complexity and compliance challenges. For example, a telecommunications sector company that has experienced a cyber incident may need to:  Notify federal law enforcement of the breach under the FCCs CPNI rules;  Notify affected individuals of the breach under the FCCs CPNI rules;  Identify and comply with reporting obligations under county, state, and state public utility commission notification rules;   Analyze whether the incident triggered overseas reporting obligations;  18 CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No. 2, SEC (Oct. 13, 2011), https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance topic2 htm; Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Interpretation, 83 Fed. Reg. 8166 (Feb. 26, 2018), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR 2018 02 26/pdf/2018 03858.pdf (SEC 2018 Guidance).  19 See, e.g., SEC, Press Release, SEC Announces Enforcement Results for FY 2021 (Nov. 18, 2021) (stating agency pursued 697 enforcement actions in fiscal year 2021).  20 See Security Breach Notification Laws, National Conference of State Legislatures (Jan. 17, 2021), https://www ncsl.org/research/telecommunications and information technology/security breach notification laws.aspx 21 Id.  7   If the incident disables the companys communications network for at least 30 minutes, make initial and final reports regarding the outage to the FCC;22 and  If the company is a government contractor and the incident affects a covered information system or defense information, report the incident to the DoD.23  All of these obligations may be layered on top of the companys own efforts to address and mitigate the breach, work with federal security agencies and local law enforcement, and inform the public of the issue. The SECs proposal threatens to further complicate these efforts. Additional obligations may also be forthcoming. The FCC is currently considering updates to its CPNI breach notification requirements, which may add additional obligations.24  The FTC has proposed to amend its Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information to require that covered financial institutions report to the FTC certain security events.25 Further, President Biden recently signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), which imposes new reporting obligations on public companies owning and operating critical infrastructure across sixteen sectors.26 Examples of varying federal approaches are illustrated in the Appendix in Table 1, Federal Regimes, and Table 2, Examples of State Regimes, describes the contours of state law requirements.  Given existing and forthcoming reporting requirements, the SEC should consider how it can harmonize its work with existing and emerging reporting requirements, which already apply  22 See 47 C.F.R. Part 4.  23 DFARS 252.204 7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204 7012 safeguarding covered defense information and cyber incident reporting.  24 Chairwoman Rosenworcel Circulates New Data Breach Reporting Requirements, FCC (Jan. 12, 2022), https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair rosenworcel circulates new data breach reporting requirements.  25 Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information, Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; request for public comment, 86 Fed.

Y (CIRCIA).  8  to many of the public companies that the SEC aims to regulate here. Indeed, it is not clear how establishing another reporting regime would benefit the public. New disclosure obligations would provide little value in light of the various other public sources of information and disclosure regimes. Further, in the critical days following an attack, company personnel already must navigate myriad existing regimes and deadlines, which can divert resources from cyber response and remediation. Before moving forward, the SEC should carefully consider whether further reporting is necessary and, if so, craft a regime more consistent with existing federal policy. C. The SEC Should Take a Risk Based Approach and Prioritize Confidentiality and Care in Disclosure. 1. Existing Consensus Approaches to Cyber Policy Take Risk Based Approaches, Including One Recently Directed by Congress. Congress, DHS, and other agencies have championed a risk based policy approach to addressing cyber incidents. Fundamentally, the SEC should take care to avoid taking cyber policy in a new and different direction for such a large swath of the U.S. economy, particularly as DHS embarks on its rulemaking to establish a reporting regime that prioritizes confidentiality and care in sharing information to advance national and homeland security.  First, the SEC should recognize differences among sectors and home in on risk. The SECs proposal would apply to all publicly traded companies and does not appear to grapple with differences in industries, company sizes, or risk profile.27 By contrast, other cyber regulatory approaches embrace targeted and flexible approaches. For example, the Transportation Security Administrations (TSA) interim Security Directives are targeted at a subset of regulated industries and purport to respond to particular threats.28 The forthcoming  27 See Proposed Rule at 16,593. 28 Security Directive 1580 21 01, Enhancing Rail Cybersecurity, TSA(December 31, 2021),  9  DHS rules under CIRCIA will apply to entities in sixteen critical infrastructure sectors29 and DHS can tailor rules to higher risk events and contexts. NISTs seminal cybersecurity guidance document, the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, as well as other best practices, acknowledge the importance of flexibility.30 The SEC proposal does not appear to reflect a risk based approach to the sort of varied entities, incidents, and impacts that should trigger mandatory disclosures. Second, the SEC should not depart from other regimes that build in flexibility in the timeline for disclosure. Flexibility may be necessary to account for the time necessary to investigate and fully evaluate the consequences of an incident. To this end, California, for example, requires disclosure in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.31 Further, regimes requiring public disclosures provide for delay while victims work with law enforcement, in order to protect the integrity of investigations.32 Notably, the FCC prohibits customer and public notification until a carrier has completed the process of notifying law enforcement and 7 full business days have passed after [such] notification. 33 The various, significant reasons to establish a more flexible reporting period are detailed in Section IV. The SEC should conform its approach to this well recognized principle. https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/sd 1580 21 01 signed.pdf (freight rail); Security Directive 1582 21 01, Enhancing Public Transportation and Passenger Railroad Cybersecurity, TSA (Dec. 31, 2021), https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/sd 1582 21 01 signed.pdf (passenger rail and rail transit). 29 Critical Infrastructure Sectors, CISA (last updated Oct. 21, 2020), https://www.cisa.gov/critical infrastructure sectors.  30 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1.1, NIST, at vi (Apr. 16, 2018), https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf. 31 Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.29(a). 32 47 C.F.R. § 64.2011(b)(1); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:8 163(c)(2). 33 47 C.F.R. §§ 64.2011(a), (b)(1). 10  Third, the SEC regime should reflect the policy goals of confidentiality and care in disclosure of information, which are hallmarks of existing regimes and the bipartisan CIRCIA just recently signed into law. As shown in Appendix Table 1, the TSA, DHS, and DoD regimes encourage confidential reporting of sensitive information. Moreover, as DHS implements CIRCIA, it will build upon the extensive privacy and civil liberty protections for information shared provided in the legislation.34 Information shared voluntarily under the Cybersecurity Incident Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015), and information that will be required to be reported under CIRCIA, is shared for cybersecurity purposes within the federal government.35  Further, information shared with state and local governments and other companies for cybersecurity purposes is anonymized and not attributable to the victim company. The SECs proposal is a departure from this approach in that all disclosed information will be public. While the SEC is attempting to advance the goal of investor awareness, by placing this goal ahead of the consensus approach in other regulations, the SEC risks undermining the confidentiality and intelligence gathering that characterize existing reporting.  2. New Requirements That Overlap, Duplicate, or Conflict with Existing Regimes Undermine Government Efforts at Harmonization.  The SECs proposal comes as Congress and the executive branch are engaged in concerted work to expand and harmonize incident reporting. CIRCIA reflects Congresss intent to minimize duplicative reporting requirements, as it directs the establishment of a Cyber Incident Reporting Counsel to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize Federal incident reporting  34 6 U.S.C. § 1504(b); Privacy and Civil Liberties Final Guidelines: Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, DHS and DOJ (Jan. 4, 2021), https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA PCL Guidelines Periodic Review 2020 final.pdf.  35 6 U.S.C. §1504; CIRCIA § 2245.  11  requirements, including those issued through regulations.36 Additionally, at the first meeting of the FCCs relaunched Cybersecurity Forum for Independent and Executive Branch Regulators, convening officials representing 30 regulatory and advisory agencies,37 Chairwoman Rosenworcel remarked that the group should focus on achieving greater consistency in the reporting of cyber incidents. Right now, theres a lot of fragmentation across sectors and jurisdictions in what information gets reported, when and how it is reported, and how that information can be used. So well discuss using this Forum as a place to work toward greater convergence on these matters.38 These ongoing federal harmonization initiatives heighten the need for the SEC to reconsider this proposal, as it would only add to an already heavily fragmented reporting landscape. IV. IF THE SEC MOVES FORWARD WITH ITS PROPOSAL, IT SHOULD BUILD FLEXIBILITY INTO ITS RULES, WHICH WOULD BETTER ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF COMPANIES, VICTIMS, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THE PUBLIC.  A. The SECs Proposed Four Business Day Timeline May Not Enable Companies to Provide Accurate Information That Meets the SECs Goals.  The SEC proposes to require registrants to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident.39 However, as shown in Appendix Tables 1 and 2, a four business day timeline does not align with other cyber reporting regimes that affected  36 CIRCIA § 2246(a). 37 Chairwoman Rosenworcel to Lead Relaunched Federal Interagency Cybersecurity Forum, FCC (Feb. 3, 2022), https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC 379926A1.pdf. 38 Remarks of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to the Cybersecurity Forum of Independent and Executive Branch Regulators, FCC (Apr. 8, 2022), https://docs fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC 382215A1.pdf. 39 Proposed Rule at 16,595. 12  registrants may be subject to, and the SEC does not provide any particularized justification for this timeline, as compared with other regulatory regimes or in terms of public benefits. This short timeline is ill suited for cyber incident disclosures. Investigations into even relatively straightforward cyber incidents can be lengthy, and a material incident may require months of analysis before a victim can confidently address the types of information that the SEC would have them make public within four days. As NIST has explained: When an event of interest has been identified, analysts assess, extract, and analyze [various] data with the goal of determining what has happened and how the organizations systems and networks have been affected. This process might be as simple as reviewing a few log entries on a single data source and determining that the event was a false alarm, or as complex as sequentially examining and analyzing dozens of sources (most of which might contain no relevant data), manually correlating data among several sources, then analyzing the collective data to determine the probable intent and significance of the event. However, even the relatively simple case of validating a few log entries can be surprisingly involved and time consuming.40  The SEC should be careful to consider the diversity of attacks and the realities of investigations and avoid an unduly short timeline for cyber incident reporting. Cyber investigations and containment can take weeks or months; they also evolve over time as facts develop.41 As DHS has observed, forensic analysis may be a part of incident management but may be managed by different personnel, who may be reliant on the incident response team and their activities.42 A short disclosure period may rush forensic analysis, which in the ordinary  40 NIST SP 800 86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, at 6 11 (Aug. 2006), https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800 86.pdf.  41 IBM, Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, IBM, at 22 (2021), https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OJDVQGRY (reporting that in 2021 it took an average of 212 days to identify, and an average 75 days to contain a breach).  Verizons Data Breach Incident Report looked at more than 79,000 breaches in 88 countries—showed approximately 60% of incidents were discovered within days. However, 20% could take months or more before organizations realized something was amiss. Shane Schick, Data breach detection time: How to minimize your mean time to detect a breach, Verizon (2021), https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/how to minimize your mean time to detect a breach/.  42 See e.g., Recommended Practice: Creating Cyber Forensics Plans for Control Systems, DHS, at 40 (Aug. 2008), (The forensics function inside an organization can be designed to support the incident response function, both  13  course may flow from incident containment and remediation work. Assuming that under such timelines a materiality determination is made between discovery and full containment, a four business day disclosure period may run before containment, and well before reliable forensic analysis is complete.  While the SEC emphasizes the need for timely incident information, its focus on speed overlooks the possibility that rushed disclosure will lead to less accurate or relevant incident information.43 The SEC proposes to mandate disclosure of:   when the incident was discovered and if it is ongoing;  a brief description of nature and scope;   whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for unauthorized purpose;   effect of incident on registrant operations;  whether incident is remediated or being remediated.44  It is quite possible that four business days after an incidents materiality has been determined, some or all of this information will be uncertain, preliminary, or in flux because a companys assessment of the nature, extent, and impact of an incident is likely to evolve as forensic and other investigations develop information.  As a result of these complexities, disclosure within four business days of a materiality determination may result in premature or erroneous facts being disseminated to the public, causing harm to consumers, shareholders, and company goodwill.45 Some commentators have  during and after initial response phases.) https://www hsdl.org/?view&did=7971.  43 See, e.g., Proposed Rule at 16,595. 44 Id. at 16,624. 45 See, e.g., Taking a Customer Centric Approach to a Data Breach: Insights from Crisis Response, Deloitte, at 12, https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ca/Documents/risk/ca Data Breach Customer Centric POV EN AODA.pdf (noting that timely notification without the proper level of detail can actually amplify customer frustration and lead to litigation) (last visited Apr. 23, 2022); Tanner De Witt, Data Breach Response: The Management Response, Tanner De Witt Solicitors (Feb. 10, 2021), https://www.tannerdewitt.com/management data breach response/ (Accuracy is critically important. The trust of customers and stakeholders will be challenged if a series of notices serves to highlight contradictions or misleading information. . . . Any benefit from prompt notice will be lost if that notice was misleading and did not give stakeholders the information they needed to respond  14  cautioned about organizations rushing through important forensics investigations to meet regulatory deadlines,46 which hinders their ability to fully recover from a security incident. A rushed disclosure timeline also increases burdens on victim organizations, who will be managing technical response, recovery, and remediation, as well as multiple possible reporting obligations.  In the days and weeks after a cyber incident occurs or is identified, companies should not be compelled to divert resources from critical tasks like remediation to resolving conflicts among various compliance requirements and deadlines.  The SECs proposed timeline appears to be based on its reporting timeframe for other types of occurrences, but it is inappropriate for cyber events. The SEC requires disclosure on a companys Form 8 K within four business days of certain triggering events.47 While four days may be workable for clearly ascertainable events, such as the date of completion of an acquisition or disposition of assets, an amendment to the registrants articles of incorporation, or the departure of a director or officer, the SEC should not apply this strict timeline to a determination that a material cyber incident has occurred. In these other contexts, there is no uncertainty as to the matter being disclosed, and no risk of premature disclosure. The differences between cyber events—perpetrated by malicious actors of dubious identity, which can require months of analysis—and the sorts of developments now subject to a four day notice period show that such a short period is not appropriate for cyber incidents.  appropriately.). 46 See Cost of a Breach: Forensics and Notification, Protenus (Sept. 14, 2016), https://www.protenus.com/resources/cost of a breach forensics and notification. 47 See Form 8 K, Section B, SEC, https://www.sec.gov/files/form8 k.pdf. 15  B. A Four Business Day Timeline Would Make It More Difficult for Law Enforcement and National Security Agencies to Work with Victims, Take Protective Measures, and Try to Identify Perpetrators. There are several reasons to proceed cautiously with making public disclosures about cybersecurity incidents. It is critical that corporate victims of cyber attacks not release information that could impede law enforcement investigations—and in light of this reality, many federal and state regimes allow for delayed disclosures to facilitate ongoing investigations. At a minimum, the SEC should reconsider its proposed timeline and look carefully at options to enable responsible disclosures that do not jeopardize law enforcement work, that minimize risk to victim companies and consumers, and that do not flood the securities markets with low quality information that may be more misleading than helpful. When and how to make public disclosures is an important facet of cyber incident response. Security agencies such as the FBI and victim companies will generally coordinate public statements concerning the incident with victim companies to ensure that harmful or sensitive information is not needlessly disclosed. Victim companies should likewise consider sharing press releases regarding a cyber incident with investigators before issuing them to avoid releasing information that might impede the ongoing investigation.48 An inflexible SEC reporting mandate could thwart such strategic information release.  Government industry collaboration, including a coordinated approach to disclosure of sensitive information, can help generate positive outcomes after an attack. The SEC should aim to promote this type of collaboration. The federal government has been working to encourage companies to partner with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and DHS to report  48 Best Practices for Victim Response and Reporting of Cyber Incidents Version 2.0, DOJ, at 19 (Sept. 2018), https://www.justice.gov/criminal ccips/file/1096971/download.  16  incidents to help identify and take action against malicious actors.49 Indeed, the government has touted cooperation to increase the chance to recover data and funds.50 Discreet cooperation can also be vital to develop mitigations for systemic vulnerabilities. This hard work and trust building has proven valuable. For example, after Colonial Pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack, the company cooperated with an FBI led investigation, resulting in recovery of millions in cryptocurrency.51  The FBI recognizes the sensitivity and value of collaboration. As a senior FBI official noted about a recent success: Thanks to information shared with us by a member of private industry, the FBI executed an innovative court authorized operation to copy and remove those backdoors from hundreds of vulnerable computers across the country. 52 This successful federal private sector coordination respected the need for care and confidentiality in handling sensitive cyber information, as the FBI explained: Maybe most importantly to the private sector, we only did this after publicly releasing information on the compromises and working with Microsoft to directly contact server owners to allow them time to fix the problem on their own.53 These types of coordination and collaboration must continue and the SEC should be careful to not impede these efforts. 49 Cyber Incident Reporting: A Unified Message for Reporting to the Federal Government, DHS, https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cyber%20Incident%20Reporting%20United%20Message.pdf (last visited Apr. 22, 2022). 50 See id. 51 Evan Perez, et al., First on CNN: US recovers millions in cryptocurrency paid to Colonial Pipeline ransomware hackers, CNN (June 8, 2021), https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/politics/colonial pipeline ransomware recovered/index.html.  52 Oversight of the FBI Cyber Division, Hearing Before the H.

The Proposed Timeline Could Expose Victims to Greater Cybersecurity Threats and Re Victimization.  Another risk of the SEC proposal is that it could open the door to additional attacks for a company and its customers that have already been victims of cybercrime. One reason that federal law enforcement pursues an approach centered on confidentiality and discretion54 is that disclosures about cybersecurity incidents can be a valuable source of information for bad actors.  For example, detailed disclosures can undermine the companys efforts and expose them as a target for additional attacks. In its 2018 guidance, the SEC was correct to note that [t]his guidance is not intended to suggest that a company should make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts  for example, by providing a ‘roadmap for those who seek to penetrate a companys security protections. We do not expect companies to publicly disclose specific, technical information about their cybersecurity systems, the related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would make such systems, networks, and devices more susceptible to a cybersecurity incident.55 This approach was sound, as disclosure of incidents and associated details could give bad actors a roadmap to exploit systems.  Additionally, premature disclosures may encourage bad actors to exploit and re victimize companies and their customers. Re victimization of companies after a cybersecurity incident is a real threat, and publicly confirming a breach or releasing information about incidents serves as an invitation to malicious actors and opportunists. For example, there have been copycat attempts and anonymous personas on the dark web that claim to have copies of exfiltrated data or  54 See Small Business Information Sharing: Combating Foreign Cyber Threats, FBI (Jan. 30, 2018) (testimony from Cyber Division Deputy Assistant Director Howard Marshall before the House Small Business Committee), https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/small business information sharing combating foreign cyber threats. [t]he FBIs approach in working with potential or actual victims of cyber intrusions or attacks is to first and foremost, and to the best of our ability, use our processes to protect the victim from being re victimized, and to provide confidentiality and discretion during the investigative process.  55 SEC 2018 Guidance at 8,169.  18  information, piling burdens onto victim companies to evaluate claims and determine how to respond.56 Further, it is not uncommon to see customers whose data has been involved in a breach be preyed on by fraudsters. For example, bad actors may attempt to reach out to customers pretending to offer assistance or remediation post breach.57 These kinds of practices already occur, but publicizing incidents early in a uniform manner would encourage them.  For these reasons, state and federal laws recognize the benefits of careful and properly timed disclosures58 and companies in the midst of a cyber incident are careful about disclosures. As NIST has noted in guidance on cyber information sharing, unauthorized disclosure of information about cyber incidents may impede or disrupt an ongoing investigation, jeopardize information needed for future legal proceedings, or disrupt response actions such as botnet takedown operations.59 The concept of responsible public disclosure is familiar to security professionals, as in the context of vulnerabilities, where the government and the private sector recognize the need to balance the potential benefits of providing information to the public against risks involved with premature disclosure.60 As the European Telecommunications Standards Institute explains in its Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, premature public disclosures can reduce security by informing malicious actors before protections are in place.61 56 See, e.g., Mathew J. Schwartz, ‘SolarLeaks Site Claims to Offer Attacks Victims Data, BankInfo Security (Jan. 13, 2021), https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/solarleaks site offers supply chain attack victims data a 15751 (discussing online groups claims of selling data stolen from entities that were victims of the SolarWinds breach despite no hard evidence to support the claims). 57 FBI Issues Warning after Extortion Schemes Surface Following Spate of Mega Breaches, Trendmicro (June 3, 2016), https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/fr/security/news/cyber attacks/fbi warning after extortion schemes surface following mega breaches  58 See Colo.

The SEC should reconsider aspects of its proposal that may result in these unintended consequences. V. IF INCIDENT REPORTING RULES ARE ADOPTED, THEY SHOULD BE WORKABLE FOR REGISTRANTS, PROMOTE COLLABORATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND PROVIDE THE TIME NECESSARY TO DISCLOSE ACCURATE AND USEFUL INFORMATION.  If the SEC proceeds with incident reporting rules for public companies, CTIA urges the SEC to reconsider several elements and amend its proposal.  A. Any SEC Disclosure Requirement Should Prioritize Provision of Accurate Information Over Speed by Permitting Flexibility in the Timing of Disclosures. If the SEC proceeds with an incident disclosure mandate, it should ensure that any timeline for disclosure be greater than four business days after determination that a material incident occurred and account for the flexibility needed in dealing with a cyber incident.  Consistent with these principles, the SEC should consider requiring reporting without unreasonable delay. This type of standard for a reporting timeframe is particularly appropriate for public disclosures, where accuracy and reliability should be prioritized over speed. In other contexts, Congress has directed 72 hour reporting to CISA under CIRCIA because of the expectation that the agency may be able to provide operational support to respond and remediate and may benefit from rapid situational awareness of cyber threats for intelligence and homeland security purposes. But the SEC has no such operational need for speed, so the utility of a four business day disclosure period for investor decision making is unclear, and such a short period  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi tr/103800 103899/103838/01.01.01 60/tr 103838v010101p.pdf. 20  may lead to the disclosure of incomplete or premature information, which could mislead the public and investors. B. Any Adopted Rules Should Permit Delayed Reporting for National Security or Law Enforcement Purposes.  The SEC should reconsider its conclusion that its new mandate would not provide for a reporting delay when there is an ongoing internal or external investigation related to the cybersecurity incident.62 The SEC should allow registrants to delay reporting, for these and other national security or law enforcement reasons, including ongoing investigation of the culprit, cause, and extent of security incidents. As shown in Appendix Table 2, several state laws provide that a company may delay notification if law enforcement determines notice may impede a criminal investigation.63 Notably, the FCCs CPNI disclosure rules prohibit carriers from disclosing a breach to the public until seven business days have passed after notification to the Secret Service and the FBI.64 Any SEC rules should account for such permissible delays. Accommodating law enforcement needs is consistent with the SECs approach in other areas. For example, the SEC Enforcement Manual provides that, in certain circumstances it is appropriate for criminal authorities to ask SEC staff to refrain from taking actions that would harm the criminal investigations.65 The rule should also allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security, as the SEC  62 Proposed Rule at 16,596. 63 E.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(c); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:8 163(c)(2); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 899 aa(4). 64 47 CFR § 64.2011.  65 Enforcement Manual, SEC, Division of Enforcement, Office of Chief Counsel, at 85 (Nov. 28, 2017), https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/enforcementmanual.pdf. 21  asks in the NPRM.66 Any SEC cyber disclosure requirements must properly account for the well established needs of law enforcement with respect to cybercrime investigations. C. The SEC Should Avoid Creating Ongoing Reporting Requirements Without a Deadline. The SEC should reconsider its proposal to require a registrant to provide updated disclosure in periodic reports about previously reported cybersecurity incidents, 67 as this could transform a one time incident disclosure into a never ending requirement for ongoing disclosures about shifts of any magnitude in the registrants policies and procedures. Companies often update their regulators and consumers about developments in a major cyber incident, making additional mandates from the SEC superfluous while creating an ongoing compliance burden for reporting companies. The SECs proposal is broad and would require information about any changes in policies and procedures as a result of the cyber incident at any point in the future, not just material changes or changes that occurred in a certain timeframe.68 This open ended, perpetual requirement would add to the burden registrants already face in disclosing material information in their periodic filings. Additionally, the requirement would not provide a corresponding benefit to market participants, who can obtain much of the same information—filtered through a materiality lens—in a more digestible format through the registrants typical SEC filings.  66 Proposed Rule at 16,598. 67 Id. at 16,593. 68 Id. 22  D. The SEC Should Refrain from Adopting Overly Broad Definitions and Triggers, Which May Create Internal Compliance Challenges and Lead Companies to Overreport. If the SEC proceeds with an incident disclosure mandate, it should narrow its definitions and triggers. A broad new disclosure obligation, as proposed in the NPRM, will complicate compliance in several important ways. For example, public companies maintain programs to monitor and prevent insider trading and have adjusted their approaches to address material cybersecurity events and risks. Some programs include robust internal and external monitoring and are often tailored to particular incidents and the personnel involved, which can vary over time based on complexity and severity of an incident. Compliance functions will become particularly complex considering the SECs consideration of repeated minor incidents becoming material in the aggregate or over time,69 which could mean that routine information about daily cyber activities becomes insider information. If disclosure and reporting obligations expand without clear guidance, companies may—in an abundance of caution—need to presumptively treat entire security departments and functions as possessing potential inside information and further restrict trading, disadvantaging those employees. Overly broad or undefined obligations may also lead to unhelpful reporting of incidents that are not truly material, which may confuse or mislead investors. Broad or unclear reporting requirements could lead thousands of publicly traded companies to report incidents as often as daily. In particular, the SEC should reconsider its proposed requirement that registrants must update incident disclosures when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate.70 It will be extraordinarily  69 Id. 70 Id. at 16,599.  23  challenging for a company to determine when several potentially unrelated incidents may become material.71  Sweeping, vague requirements could put companies in the difficult position of reporting every potential incident or facing penalties. At the same time, the SEC should not place itself as the arbiter of determining whether a material critical incident occurred. The nature and criticality of cyber incidents will vary across industries and companies, making one size fits all rules or guidance inapt. The SEC must eschew an overly broad, all encompassing approach. E. Any Rule Should Incorporate Safe Harbors and Protections for Companies Reporting Incidents in Good Faith. Companies required to comply with an SEC incident reporting regime should have a safe harbor from enforcement if they delay reporting due to a determination by the company or law enforcement that disclosure would impede the investigation and resolution. As the SEC proposes, it would be appropriate to amend Rules 13a 11(c) and 15d 11(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to include new Item 1.05 in the list of Form 8 K items eligible for a limited safe harbor from liability under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b 5 under the Exchange Act.72 Additionally, companies reporting pursuant to the new rules should have a safe harbor from liability for properly disclosed forward looking claims.73  These safe harbor protections are necessary due to the substantial litigation risks and burdens companies will face. Securities class action litigation can be abused and should be reserved for cases that truly harm investors and shareholders. To ensure any incident reporting  71 Id. 72 Id. at 16,597.  73 See 15 U.S.C. § 77z 2 (providing safe harbor for forward looking statements).  24  rules do not lead to unjustified litigation over good faith judgment calls relating to ongoing or past security incidents, the SEC should include appropriate safe harbors. VI. THE SEC SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS PROPOSED GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE RULES.  A. Companies Are Best Positioned to Determine the Ideal Makeup of Boards. The SEC proposes to require public companies to disclose the cyber expertise of the members of the board of directors,74 with the apparent goal of encouraging companies to select board members with cybersecurity backgrounds or experience. This requirement should not be adopted. The criteria outlined by the SEC in determining whether a board member has cybersecurity expertise75 does not reflect the range of experiences, beyond cybersecurity backgrounds or credentials, that could contribute to robust board oversight of cyber risk management. Board members may have varied experiences that contribute to oversight of a companys cyber risk, such as having managed organizations through cyber response in the past.  Companies are in the best position to determine the ideal makeup and size of their boards.  When seeking board members, expertise in specific areas may be useful, but diversity of background, experience, and skills are primary concerns.76 Companies and their advisors factor in a broad range of considerations when determining the appropriate composition of their boards.  The boards of AT&T, Verizon, and T Mobile, for example, are composed of a diverse set of individuals with varied background and experience,77 which fosters robust company oversight  74 See Proposed Rule at16,600. 75 Proposed Rule at 16.602.  76 See, e.g., Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, What Makes Great Boards Great, Harvard Business Review (Sept. 2002), https://hbr.org/2002/09/what makes great boards great  77 See, e.g. Corey Anthony, We Hear You, Loud and Clear, AT&T (July 14, 2021), https://about.att.com/inside connections blog/2021/diversity equity inclusion annual report.html (discussing diversity of Board of Directors); Diversity and Inclusion, Verizon, https://www.verizon.com/about/our company/diversity and inclusion; Jeff Green, T Mobile Leads Boardroom Diversity Gains for S&P 500 Companies, Bloomberg (July 15, 2021), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021 07 15/t mobile push for board  25  and protection of shareholder interests. Studies have found that governance and shareholder interests can be best promoted through recruiting demographically diverse directors who also help improve cognitive diversity in the boardroom.78 Companies pursue various goals in building diverse and innovative boards; these efforts, which benefit investors, should not be limited or disfavored by additional expectations for specialized expertise that may be not be plentiful across the economy.79 The SECs proposal would potentially hinder companies ability to establish a board with the optimal skills and experience to protect investor interests by encouraging them to choose members who have a specific set of cybersecurity credentials, rather than other relevant experience or alignment with other corporate priorities and obligations. Certain registrants, such as those doing classified work for the U.S. government, may need to address national security experience in determining the makeup of their boards. Others may want to focus on geopolitical issues or supply chain. The Commissions proposal could crowd out other areas of expertise and harm companies that provide critical services to the U.S. government. Smaller or resource constrained companies may face challenges in hiring board members that have the specific cyber expertise the Commission would require and be put at a disadvantage in the market.  diversity leads june gain in s p 500 (a wide range of experience and perspective, as well as diversity in gender, race and ethnicity, absolutely makes us a better organization, CEO Mike Sievert said in an emailed statement).  78 Jared Landaw, Maximizing the Benefits of Board Diversity: Lessons Learned From Activist Investing, Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance (July 14, 2020), https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/07/14/maximizing the benefits of board diversity lessons learned from activist insting/.  79 Cybersecurity expertise is in short supply across the economy, see, e.g., NIST NICE, https://www.nist.gov/document/workforcedemandonepager2021finalpdf and GAO, GAO 19 144, Cybersecurity Workforce (2019) (the federal government and private industry face a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT professionals to implement and oversee information security protections to combat cyber threats.). Within the cyber work force, observers have found that [m]inority professionals make up a significant portion of the cybersecurity workforce, but are underrepresented across senior roles within their organizations. (ISC)2 Global Information Security Workforce Study at 8 (2018) available at https://www.isc2.org/Research/Cybersecurity Diversity#. 26  Mandated disclosures may serve little purpose, as cyber risk management may not necessarily be a responsibility of an individual board member. Companies use various tools for cyber risk management, including board committees, audit committees, and other specially tasked groups to address risks to their operations. Part of good governance includes relying on appropriate subject matter experts, both within a company and through outside consulting engagements, to inform management.80 Further, a mandate is not needed to raise awareness of the importance of cybersecurity issues in governance. Scholarly and industry work shows that cyber is on the radar for senior executives and boards,81 who address cyber risk and other emerging issues in various ways along with other priorities like diversity, innovation, turnover, optimal composition, and roles.82  Moreover, it is also unclear how an investor would productively use information about a board members expertise. Investors may not themselves have cybersecurity backgrounds or know how to assess a board members cybersecurity credentials. It is unrealistic to assume that investors will find information regarding the cyber credentials of an individual on the board useful in informing their investment decisions. There are also questions about the legality of such a requirement. While couched in the context of a disclosure requirement, this proposed rule would serve as an implicit direction from  80 See Resource Center, NACD, https://www.nacdonline.org/insights/resource center.cfm?itemnumber=20789 (providing resources such as board assessment of effectiveness of cybersecurity programs, tools for directors in building relationships with the chief information security officer and broader cybersecurity team).  81 See Scott Chase, Directors to Watch 2021 Rank Top Issues for Public Company Boards, Directors & Boards, https://www.directorsandboards.com/articles/singledirectors watch 2021 rank top issues public company boards (discussing results of survey identifying top issues and priorities for boards, with threat of ransomware and cybersecurity breaches taking third spot). 82 See, e.g., George M. Anderson & David Chun, How Much Board Turnover Is Best?, Harvard Business Review (Apr.2014), https://hbr.org/2014/04/how much board turnover is best; David F. Larcher & Brain Tayan, Board Composition, Quality, & Turnover, Stanford Business School (April 2020), https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty research/publications/cgri research spotlight board composition quality turnover. 27  the SEC to public companies on how they should conduct their cybersecurity programs. While Congress authorized the SEC to regulate corporate governance under the Sarbanes Oxley Acts disclosure requirement related to audit committee financial experts,83 here the SEC proposes to go several steps further by requiring disclosure of the subject matter expertise of board members that have a wide range of responsibilities that go beyond cybersecurity. Such requirements should be adopted only to the extent mandated by federal legislation. B. The SEC Should Not Require Disclosures on Registrants Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance. Disclosures on cyber risk management and strategy may offer bad actors insight into a companys strategy and allow them to identify vulnerabilities more easily. The FBI has advised that malicious actors look at SEC filings and key events to target victims.84 Malicious efforts could increase if bad actors can find cyber risk management, key personnel, and changes to strategy, in SEC filings. Cybersecurity is a nuanced, multi faceted concept that affects public companies in vastly different ways across sectors. The SEC should not impose its judgment of what proper cyber risk management should look like by requiring registrants to make specific disclosures on cyber policies and governance. There is no one size fits all approach to cybersecurity. Companies need flexibility to address cybersecurity threats in a manner that best fits the unique circumstances that they confront. Mandating specific governance requirements for cybersecurity would limit this important flexibility and hamstring companies into rigid governance structures that could hinder their broader risk management efforts.  83 15 U.S.C.§ 7265. 84 See FBI PIN 20211101 001, Private Industry Notification: Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims, FBI, (Nov. 01, 2021), https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/PIN 202111101.pdf. 28  Further, new rules are unnecessary when existing rules and guidance already direct companies to disclose these types of information where relevant. The SECs rules already require a company to disclose the extent of the boards role in the risk oversight of the registrant, such as how the board administers its oversight function, and the effect that this has on the boards leadership structure.85 Also, the SECs 2018 Guidance noted that [t]o the extent cybersecurity risks are material to a companys business, we believe this discussion should include the nature of the boards role in overseeing the management of that risk.86 The information that is currently provided is sufficient to inform market participants on this topic.  VII. CONCLUSION CTIA appreciates this opportunity to comment and encourages the SEC to reconsider, or in the alternative, modify the proposed cyber incident and risk management disclosure rules.  CTIA recommends the SEC align any new rules with other federal requirements and reporting regimes and ensure that, in encouraging provision of accurate information to market participants, it does not invite negative, unintended consequences.

The breadth of industrial activities performed by IADCs drilling and support service contractor organizations enables access to vital energy reserves that underpin a 21st century global economy while serving to lift disadvantaged regions of the world from energy poverty. The below comments represent a majority view of the IADC membership and are offered without prejudice to those comments that may also be offered or submitted directly by IADC members in response to this 23 March Federal Register Notice. IADC respectfully requests that the Securities and Exchange Commission rescind this proposed rule for addressing cybersecurity risk management and disclosure. The basis of this most reasonable of requests is made after careful consideration of first; the remote likelihood that measures as currently proposed herein would achieve the intended objective of appreciably enhancing investor insight beyond information already required for disclosure; and secondly, the SECs authority to undertake such action. While cyber risk and management of related risk continues to take on increasing significance for most any 21st century organization, this concern is clearly associated with an operational support function akin to a number of other operational considerations in the conduct of an organizations business. IADC understands the SECs concern for this issue. However, the question that naturally follows related to the subject matter scope reflected in this rule making is: Why does the SEC only consider cyber risk and management of such risk where other business threats seemingly manifest similarly risky impacts? Just as cyber risks are certainly a concern for an organization that relies on modern day interconnectivity, so too is a fundamental concern for workforce and industrial safety. Just as a cyber threat can pose a significant risk to an organizations wellbeing and its investors, systemic safety and/or a variety of industrial risks can, for example, similarly exact extreme consequences upon an organizations performance and jeopardize its 2  continued solvency. Identified business risks are, no doubt, challenges that must be reconciled in the context of how an organizations resources are employed as reflected in the dispatch of its equipment assets, people, and organizational processes. These proposed provisions, if enacted, would impose direct authority over an organizations operational decisions within the context of how cyber resources are to be employed and maintained. Moreover, such a precedent would leave open the prerogative of the SEC to further expand the scope of its disclosure concerns beyond cyber risks as would be in keeping with the presumed logic that has brought this proposed rule to fruition. This proposed rule cites, as a central premise, a need for compelling an organizations disclosure as it relates to material impact, material future impact, identification of remedy actions & capabilities, and learning from incidents to inform the management of procedures. While IADC understands the SECs function is to garner compliance of disclosure requirements that accurately reflect the financial health of a public organization, its proposed rule appears to assert regulatory privilege where such purview is already exercised by other executive agencies. IADC is concerned that longstanding operational mandates executed among respective state and federal agencies may not comport with SEC cyber risk provisions in a congruent manner  while consequently leaving an array of industries pondering the appropriate course for satisfying compliance.  As no analysis of these proposed provisions is discussed in this rulemaking, the degree to which this proposal may or may not be complimentary to existing rules remains exceedingly unclear. As this rule would, inter alia, seek to impose reporting requirements for certain company officers, director level personnel, and mechanisms within an organizations hierarchy, IADC is perplexed as to how the SEC, a securities regulatory commission, would assess the requisite technical knowledge, competencies, and practices necessary to determine satisfactory compliance. Though cyber risk best practice strategies and management frameworks continue to emerge, this nascent discipline does not yet enjoy a level of ubiquity that would otherwise facilitate reliable compliance reporting measures across industries or even within a particular business sector. Finally, this rulemaking has been undertaken where authority to do so does not exist in the manner proposed. Section 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended on January 1, 2021), titled Necessity for Regulations as provided in this Title, states the need for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto. Reference to this phrase in Section 2 appertains to securities transactions conducted on exchanges and in over the counter markets with national public interest. Section 2 of the Act continues on to discuss the need for appropriate reports and to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system for securities… Discussion in Section 2 of the Act further continues to explain the need for effecting regulation that makes the process for securities transactions reasonably complete and effective. Nowhere in Section 2 is reference made to the need for the Act to compel compliance apart from that directly attributed to the transaction of securities. Should an argument be posited that 3  existing language in the Act does, in fact, support this rule making, then such logic would suggest a reductio ad absurdum pertaining to the entirety of the federal regulatory system.  Once again, this recension request is made with the utmost consideration and prudent measure of reason with which the certainty of disclosure requirements can continue to be relied upon and satisfied. IADC appreciates the opportunity to contribute to this consultative process and looks forward to further engaging on this matter as the SEC may invite.  Please feel free to contact Jim Rocco at  for further clarification or insight on the comments provided herein. Sincerely,  Jason McFarland  President, IADC",1

These organizations represent companies from all segments of the American oil and natural gas industry and are involved in exploration, production, refining, marketing, distribution, and marine activities. Cybersecurity is an issue of paramount concern to our members and the industry has taken steps and committed resources to the safety and security of our operations. For example, the industry has established multiple Information Sharing and Analysis Centers that are dedicated to the oil and natural gas sector to share cyber threat information and 2  disseminate mitigation and prevention best practices in a timely manner.1 Member companies have also instituted highly regarded standards and frameworks to strengthen their cybersecurity posture such as the National Institute for Standards and Technologys (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. This framework is widely used within our industry and our members actively participated in its development and updating.2 API has also written and published an industry standard, API STD 1164, Pipeline Control Systems Cybersecurity, to guide companies in strengthening the cybersecurity of pipeline operations.3 Additionally, the industry works closely with our federal partners— including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—to continuously mitigate new and emerging threats to ensure member companies are prepared for cyber incidents.  We acknowledge the Commission for taking an interest in engaging on this important topic, which has been primarily the province of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with the FBI and the other elements of the intelligence community and federal law enforcement. Although there is a role for the Commission regarding how registrants approach communicating cybersecurity risks to investors, we believe that existing Commission guidance adequately protects investors4 and the Proposal surpasses the Commissions legal authority and presents significant policy concerns that would ultimately harm registrants (and accordingly harm investors) if finalized in its current form. The Proposal, albeit well intentioned, would undermine cybersecurity efforts rather than advance them, and it would impose significant costs on public companies.  1 See Oil and Natural Gas Info.

Consideration of the Commissions Statutory Authority to Finalize the Proposal.  The Commissions authority to require public disclosures is limited by the statutes that give it rulemaking authority.5 Although Congress has conferred on the Commission the power to promulgate rules that require public disclosures in both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,6 the Proposal could surpass those grants of authority and its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.7  The Proposal contains only a limited explanation of the statutory authority behind the rulemaking and does not adequately clarify why the robust guidance issued by the Commission in 2018 is inadequate to address the Commissions expressed concern of informing investors of a registrants approach to cybersecurity risks and the material impacts from cybersecurity events. To ensure our organizations and other stakeholders have such an opportunity to understand the full authority to propose rules beyond what may be relevant or useful to investors, further elaboration of the legal basis for finalizing the rule beyond one passing reference to over 70 pages of statutory text is necessary.  Certainly, the Securities Act and Exchange Act empowers the Commission to require disclosures related to the financial health of a registrant and to give investors a true picture of the securities on the market. Rulemaking in areas beyond this, however, have been limited and are best defined by Congress. For example, Congress has used statutory authorizations to require disclosures on corporate responsibility, corporate governance, and selected aspects of executive compensation.8 Similarly, Congress has spoken clearly when it previously authorized the Commission to require disclosures related to specific public policy concerns, such as conflict minerals.9 This practice is appropriate because  5 New York Stock Exch. LLC v. SEC, 962 F.3d 541, 554 (D.C. Cir. 2020). 6 See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77g(a)(1), 77s(a), 78l(b)(1), 78m(a), 78w(a). 7 Id. § 78qq(a)(2)(A). Section 11A of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for securities and having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to use its authority to achieve this goal. Id. § 78k 1(a)(2). 8 See SEC, Concept Release, Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation S K, 81 Fed. Reg. 23,916, 23,922 (April 22, 2016).  9 See id. At 23,969 70 (explaining that Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act mandated that the Commission adopt rules regarding registrants use of conflict minerals.); Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank), 15 U.S.C. § 78m(p) (2010).  4  it is well established that the courts expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an executive agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.10 With respect to cybersecurity, Congress has not clearly authorized the Commission to promulgate broad regulations requiring registrants to disclose cybersecurity information in their registration statements and quarterly and annual filings, which will impose significant costs upon issuers in their registration statements and quarterly and annual filings. Rather, given that cybersecurity concerns present economic, political, and national security significance, Congress has repeatedly legislated in recent years and assigned new regulatory powers to other agencies—and not the Commission.11 These enactments have included broad information sharing requirements to facilitate and encourage the private sector to share information with DHS, FBI, and other elements of the intelligence community and federal law enforcement.12 Indeed, Congress designated CISA within DHS as the lead cybersecurity and critical infrastructure agency.13 Congress explicitly gave CISA responsibility to develop and coordinate cybersecurity protocols across the government and to coordinate with the private sector.14  Recent legislation also highlighted concerns around public disclosure of cyber incidents by exempting reports to CISA from the Freedom of Information Act.15 That Congress has been so active with respect to cybersecurity, repeatedly bestowing authority upon executive branch departments and agencies but never to the Commission expressly,  10 NFIB v. OSHA, 142 S. Ct. 661, 665 (2022). 11 See, e.g., Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong. (2022) § 2242(b)(1) (directing the CISA to promulgate regulations to implement the Acts reporting obligations for covered entities); Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018, 6 U.S.C. § 652 (creating the CISA); Cybersecurity Act of 2015, 6 U.S.C. § 1504(a)(4) (directing the Attorney General and the Secretary of the DHS to develop guidance to promote sharing of cyber threat indicators with Federal entities); Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3551, 3554 (codifying information security requirements for the federal government to be administered by the Office of Management and Budget and the DHS). Congress also annually enacts cybersecurity measures through the appropriations process. For example, this year, Congress expanded the CISAs budget by more than 28 percent, which was more than $460 million over the administrations request for the fiscal year. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022). 12 See Cybersecurity Act of 2015, 6 U.S.C. § 1504(a)(4) (encouraging public and private sector entities to share cyber threat information with the federal government).  13 6 U.S.C. § 652. 14 Id. 15 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022). 5  speaks volumes about the Commissions lack of authority to enact the reticulated, prescriptive, mandatory rules in the Proposal.  II. The Proposal Is Not in the Public Interest and Would Undermine Cybersecurity.  We believe that the Proposal, considering existing guidance from the Commission, would not further advance the public interest, would undermine cybersecurity, and would impose substantial costs and burdens upon registrants with no corresponding benefit.  A. There Is No Need for the Commission to Further Address Cybersecurity Practice Through This Rulemaking.  The Commission has not explained why the Proposal is needed or required for all registrants. A rule is arbitrary and capricious unless an agency examines the relevant data and articulates a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.16 Registrants currently may, and do, report material cybersecurity incidents through 10 K forms, 8 K forms, press releases, and through other means. The Proposal does not identify any material harm, misinformation, or negative impact to registrants or investors from the current practices. Instead, it notes there may have been some inconsistencies among reports, and that the Commission believes that investors would benefit from the proposed requirements.17 That is insufficient. Indeed, as noted below, the Commission has not identified any quantifiable or qualitative benefits that are substantially supported with evidence cited in the Proposal that would result from the Proposals requirements. The lack of examination of relevant data or a reasoned explanation of why the Proposal is needed would render any final version of the Proposal arbitrary and capricious.  Moreover, the Proposal is unnecessary because investors already receive relevant information regarding a cybersecurity breachs effect on the health of a registrant under the Commissions current guidance on cybersecurity disclosures. The Commissions 2018 Interpretive Release instructs companies to timely disclose information in periodic reports about material cybersecurity incidents.18 This guidance affords companies discretion to ascertain the relevant and material facts to be disclosed and acknowledges  16 Susquehanna Intl Grp., LLP v. SEC, 866 F.3d 442, 445 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (cleaned up). 17 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16,590, 16,594 (proposed March 23, 2022) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 229, 232, 239, 240, 249) 18 SEC, Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Release No. 33 10459 1, 12 (Feb. 26, 2018), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf.  6  that some material facts may not be available at the time of the initial disclosure, that a company may require time to discern the implications of a cybersecurity incident, and that an ongoing investigation of a cybersecurity incident may affect the scope of disclosure regarding the incident.19 The guidance ensures that investors receive information about material incidents without the attendant risks and unnecessary costs to registrants that the Proposal would impose. Although the Commission observed certain cybersecurity incidents that were reported in the media but that were not disclosed in a registrants filings while registrants were operating under this guidance, the Commission does not fully explain why the 2018 guidance, when followed by registrants, is insufficient.20 It in fact acknowledges that it is unable to determine the number of material cybersecurity incidents that are not being disclosed in a timely manner.21 Simply because the Commission observed a handful of instances in which cybersecurity incidents were not disclosed in accordance with the guidance does not mean that the guidance is insufficient. In our experience, the guidance is sufficient to inform investors about the financial health of a registrant. The Commissions objectives would be better met through further education surrounding the already issued guidance than by changing the regulatory requirements. B. The Proposal Will Undermine Cybersecurity. 1. The Proposals four day timeline is too short for a public disclosure and will put companies at risk of further exploitation. Forcing registrants to report on this timeline, while incidents are still ongoing, publicizes that the company has at least one exploitable vulnerability to every bad actor throughout the globe, prompting them to search and potentially exploit a registrants previously unknown access to their systems or data. This is wildly dangerous to any individual whose personally identifiable information may have been exposed and a specific reporting period may not give the registrant enough time to help protect vulnerable individuals. Again, forcing registrants to disclose even when the incident is ongoing alerts bad actors that the company is still vulnerable and leaves them susceptible to more attacks or breaches.  Although other regulations and laws require disclosure of a cyber incident within a shorter timeframe, there are safeguards against sharing that information and against disclosure to the public. For example, Congress recently passed cybersecurity reporting  19 Id.  20 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,594. 21 Id.  7  legislation, discussed in more detail below, that requires companies to report cybersecurity incidents within 72 hours. But Congress included several liability protections that encourages timely reporting and protects companies who comply with the mandatory and voluntary disclosure obligations under the Act.22 Similarly, some state security breach reporting laws require disclosure of a cybersecurity breach in less than four days, but these laws typically require disclosures to be made directly to affected persons and entities, rather than to the general public and also have other safeguards in place that delay a companys disclosure obligations.23 A four day period to publicly disclose a cyber incident may not allow a registrant enough time to fully realize the impacts of the incident or to fully remedy the exploited vulnerability before disclosing.  In addition to putting registrants at risk for further exploitation, the Proposals timeline will divert a registrants vital resources away from mitigating a cybersecurity incident and toward complying with reporting obligations. In the hours and days following a cybersecurity breach, companies must quickly and efficiently contain, minimize, and remedy any damage or loss resulting from the breach. Each of these measures must happen as soon as possible after a breach occurs and with the full attention of the registrants resources and management—especially those devoted to cybersecurity. The Proposals requirement to publicly report the incident while these actions are ongoing will disrupt these crucial response measures.  Moreover, the short timeline for public reporting will force companies to make consequential decisions about incident containment and remediation in a rushed and potentially higher risk manner. Once a public disclosure has been made, cybersecurity personnels options for containing a breach or attack while fully investigating the methods involved to improve security and prevent future attacks become limited. The inflexible four day timeframe prioritizes speed of disclosure over safety and protection of information and critical resources.  2. Companies within the industry have complex supply chains and rely on different third party service providers for capital projects and in support of industry operations. The complexity of these supply chains present inherent difficulties for companies to impose in depth oversight for cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In addition, forcing  22 See Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, H.R. 2471, 116th Cong. (2022). 23 See, e.g., O.C.G.A. 10 1 912 (Georgias security breach notification law requires companies to notify relevant data owners if personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person, within 24 hours of discovering a breach. The required notification may be delayed for law enforcement purposes). Each state has some version of a security breach notification law.  8  disclosure of details regarding a companys vendor and supply chain information is likely to expose a registrant to further attacks. Cybercriminals have in the past exploited third party vendors and software updates to infiltrate their customers cyber infrastructure.24 Any benefit from revealing the proposed information regarding third party service providers would be outweighed by the increased risk of revealing potential targets.  3. Although the Proposal claims that what constitutes materiality for purposes of the proposed incident disclosures would be consistent with traditional definitions, the Proposal in effect suggests that the Commission anticipates some other metric of materiality than what is currently required to be disclosed within form 8 K. For example, the Proposal would require that issuers report when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate.25 This would require companies to categorize previously immaterial incidents as material, which goes against the definition of material. It is also difficult, cumbersome, and not useful for companies to report on prior incidents that did not raise to the level of material at the time, which is the entire point of the Commission proposal—to report on material cyber incidents.  Further, the Proposal asked for comment on whether to require reporting prior to a materiality designation. Many cyber events start by a simple phishing technique, and most events are easily contained and lead to no significant issue. Therefore, requiring registrants to report prior to determining whether an event is material would require registrants to potentially report on thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of cyber attacks that present no real threat to the financial health of the registrant. Notification of small events, prior to becoming material, would not benefit investors or prospective investors. To the contrary, it would confuse investors and lead to less informed investment decisions. 4. Separately, the Proposals guidance pertaining to what constitutes a cybersecurity incident is far too broad. Although the actual definition of cybersecurity incident is generally in line with established definitions of the term, the Proposals guidance after this definition suggests broader application. For instance, the Proposal says that the term includes a deliberate action or activity to gain unauthorized access to systems or to steal  24 See, e.g., Dina Temple Raston, A ‘Worst Nightmare Cyberattack: The Untold Story of the SolarWinds Hack, NPR (April 16, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/3bh4afr8.  25 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,620. 9  or alter data.26 This does not consider whether the companys security controls were sufficient to prevent a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system. If this example constitutes a cybersecurity incident, the Proposal, if finalized, would result in excessive over notification that would dilute the ability of an investor to determine cyber risk and would hardly [be] conducive to [an investors] informed decision making.27 We believe that adhering to traditional notions of materiality would continue to treat cyber incident reporting like any other event that would need to be disclosed within form 8 K. Registrants typically have a process to determine their own events that are material, and there is no need for special rules for resetting of what is considered material for reporting cybersecurity incidents.  5. The Proposal would effectively impose prescriptive one sized fits all mandates with respect to board member expertise with cybersecurity issues. To be sure, board members must be aware of cybersecurity threats to the company like they do for other important risks. For example, directors should understand company cybersecurity vulnerabilities and should be able to drive decisions regarding a companys overall efforts to guard against and address those risks. However, it is not clear why specific director expertise on cyber issues is necessary or relevant for all issuers and there should not be an expectation that most companies maintain a board of directors that has such an expert in cybersecurity—or that a company should have to explain why it doesnt have an expert on its board.  Board members do not need expertise in reverse engineering malware, the tactics, techniques, and procedures of foreign intelligence services and cybercriminals, or other highly technical computer network operation topics. Instead, most registrants, and especially all large ones, will have a Chief Information Security Officer and significant access to technical expertise that can inform the board on addressing these issues and situations. In addition, the Proposal does not adequately describe how to even measure cybersecurity expertise among the Board or why having board members with technical expertise regarding cyber risks would be more beneficial than having other cybersecurity resources within a company. For example, individual technical degrees may not include the practical knowledge of leading teams that address current cybersecurity threats and incidents. Accordingly, the benefit case for needing cybersecurity specific expertise on  26 Id. at 16,601. 27 TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 449. 10  the Board, or requiring an explanation of why not, does not appear to be clearly articulated by the Proposal. III. The Commission Should Consider Several Amendments to the Proposal. As previously noted, we do not believe that any change to the current disclosure requirements is necessary or appropriate as the status quo aptly serves registrants and investors. If the Commission does decide to move forward with some form of the Proposal, then it should amend the final version in several ways.  A. Elimination of Prescriptive Reporting Timeline We believe that the four day timeline for reporting of material cyber incidents is overly restrictive for the breadth of potential responses and registrants actions to address exposed vulnerabilities. Therefore, if reporting cybersecurity breaches is required by the SEC at all, it should only be required within a reasonable time after the incident has been resolved.  B. The Commission Should Establish a Law Enforcement Exemption. The broad disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, procedures, and prevention methods would pose threats to national security. The FBI and DHS, along with other elements of the intelligence community and federal law enforcement, should be able to request that companies withhold the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents during intelligence collection or a pending law enforcement investigation. As with all intelligence collection and investigations, publicly discussing or disclosing information about the matter significantly hinders the operation or investigation. As noted, most similar state disclosure laws provide such exemptions. Ultimately, aiding law enforcement in containing a cyber attack and punishing wrongdoers best protects registrants, other companies, and investors.  For these reasons, any final rule should allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident whenever they are requested to do so by a state or federal law enforcement agency responsible for investigating cybersecurity incidents. The suggestion in the Proposals request for comments that such requests come from the Attorney General is too narrow and would call for too much involvement from a cabinet level official.28 Rather, the Commission should grant such requests whenever requested by cybersecurity officials in the FBI, DHS or CISA, or state agencies responsible for  28 See id. at 16,598. 11  investigating cybersecurity incidents who have received delegated authority to make such requests by the heads of those law enforcement agencies.  C. The Commission Should Establish a Critical Infrastructure Exemption. Similarly, the Commission should consider an exemption from required disclosure for registrants within the critical infrastructure sector. The United States has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.29 The vital nature of this infrastructure makes them a particularly attractive target to cybercriminals and other bad actors. That threat is so significant that the federal government created CISA specifically to work with the private sector to help protect critical infrastructure. The information required under the Proposal, as written, could include sensitive information that would undermine the security of critical infrastructure. Registrants that own, operate, or work with critical infrastructure should be exempted from any final requirements of the Proposal. D. The Commission Should Provide Robust Liability Protections to Facilitate any Public Disclosure. Any cybersecurity incident reporting structure should protect registrant information, include exemptions for reporting on personal data that has been compromised, and contain robust liability protections. For instance, Congress passed cybersecurity reporting legislation this year that includes needed liability protection for companies when disclosing cybersecurity incidents. Under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, companies involved in particular infrastructure sectors must report certain cyber incidents to CISA within 72 hours and certain ransomware payments within 24 hours.30 Because Congress recognized the concerns related to disclosing sensitive information in these reports, Congress protected reporting entities from certain liability associated with the submission of required or voluntary reports.31 Under the Act, the incident reports and material used to prepare the reports cannot be received as evidence,  29 See The White House, Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD 21): Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (Feb. 12, 2013), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the press office/2013/02/12/presidential policy directive critical infrastructure security and resil.  30 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, H.R. 2471, 117th Cong. (2022). These reporting obligations will not take effect until the Director of CISA promulgates implementing regulations. § 2242(b)(1). 31 Id. §§ 2242(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A).  12  subject to discovery, or used in any proceeding in federal or state court or before a regulatory body.32 Further, submitted reports must: (1) not be used by CISA, other federal agencies, or any state or local government to regulate, including through enforcement action, the activities of the entity that submitted the incident report; (2) be considered commercial, financial, and propriety information if so designated; (3) be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and similar disclosure laws; (4) not constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege or protection provided by law; and (5) not be subject to a federal rule or judicial doctrine regarding ex parte communications.33  In addition to demonstrating that Congress should lead on cybersecurity disclosure obligations rather than the Commission, this legislation demonstrates that liability protection for companies is paramount in establishing a working cybersecurity disclosure system. The Proposal, at the very least, should include the protections for registrants that the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act includes for disclosing entities.  E. At Most, High level Frameworks Rather than Specific Company Policies Should Be Subject to Public Disclosure.  Listing all cyber policies, procedures, governance structures, and management roles could result in exposing specific areas in which a registrant is vulnerable and provide intelligence to foreign nations, criminal enterprises, and other bad actors. The level of detail in the Proposals required disclosures is not only dangerous, but it would also be more costly and simply unnecessary to inform investors about the risks that cybersecurity poses to the financial health of their investment.  Accordingly, any required disclosure should be at a high level. Informing investors that a registrant has procedures, plans, and resources in place to prevent and respond to cyberattacks is sufficient for investors to make informed financial decisions. Descriptions of particular incidents should be limited to the general nature of the incident, its material impacts, and a high level description of the measures in place to prevent reoccurrence. After all, these disclosures are designed for consumption by investors or prospective investors. The other detailed elements in the Proposals required disclosures are not necessary and would not be an actual benefit to investors in making investment decisions. One alternative that would serve this purpose well is for registrants to disclose that they are complying with carefully curated cybersecurity safety frameworks. For instance, as  32 Id. § 2245(c)(3). 33 Id. § 2245(a) (c). 13  mentioned previously, many registrants make their cybersecurity policies and procedures consistent with federal frameworks or standards, such as the NISTs Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which allows registrants  to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improv[e] security and resilience.34 Informing investors that a registrant is complying with these higher level frameworks and standards would give them the comfort of knowing the company has policies, procedures, and processes in place to withstand a cyber attack but with the benefit of not jeopardizing security in the process.  * * * * * For the above reasons, API, AOPL and AFPM respectfully request that the Commission withdraw the Proposal and either retain the current reporting scheme or alter the Proposal substantially to establish several exemptions and to require only the disclosure of higher level information regarding a registrants cybersecurity frameworks. We would be pleased to discuss these concerns further with you.  Sincerely yours,  Stephen Comstock, API  VP Corporate Policy  Andrew J.

The stated purpose of this proposal is to better inform investors about a registrants risk management, strategy, and governance and to provide timely notification of material cybersecurity incidents. However, our members believe that while well intentioned, these proposed regulations will impose serious and avoidable problems for publicly traded companies operating within the defense and national security space. In this letter, we seek to address nine key areas that present possible problems or conflicts and propose alterations to the proposed rule that would best support companies performing vital government work.  I. Four Business Day Reporting Requirement:  A key tenet of the SECs proposal will require a company to report to investors within four business days of determining that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. This will create situations in which the company would be required to:  Make complex determinations on materiality with information available during the early stages of the incident, which also potentially is information that may be incorrect or incomplete  1 NDIA is a non partisan, non profit, educational association that has been designated by the IRS as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization  not a lobbying firm  and was founded to educate its constituencies on all aspects of national security. For over 100 years, NDIA has provided a platform through which leaders in government, industry, and academia can collaborate and provide solutions to advance the national security and defense needs of the nation. 3 CORE/9990000.7889/174389242.1  Potentially disclose information about material incidents that would benefit perpetrators of cyber attacks  Regarding the first point, much is unknown in the early days of an incident, including the type and scope of information potentially impacted. It is probable that such a short disclosure timeframe would lead to rushed disclosures of information that are ultimately incorrect. In addition, because companies may take longer than four business days to contain a major cyber incident, requiring public disclosures prior to containment could tip off bad actors and lead to additional cyber attacks.  In the rush to report, a company also may be required to publicly report the existence of a zero day vulnerability in vendor software without an opportunity to responsibly report the vulnerability. Public disclosure of such unpatched, zero day vulnerabilities, could tip off bad actors to look for other victims to attack, leading to additional cyber attacks across a wide array of industries. Proposed Solution: NDIA urges the SEC to reevaluate the trigger for a company reporting within four business days of determining that it has experienced a material incident and to allow for a company to report after being given an opportunity to first contain the event. NDIA would also urge the SEC to specify that companies do not have an obligation to describe, with particularity, the details of any vulnerabilities in their systems that they reasonably believe could assist cyber attackers, or details of vulnerabilities in third party software that have not been disclosed by the third party software vendor. II.  Lack of Guidance Concerning Disclosures:  The SECs proposal also requires companies to publicly disclose any material changes, additions, or updates to previously reported cyber incidents. While the proposed rule does not provide further guidance on what constitutes a reportable material change, addition or update, NDIA views there to be a substantial body of guidance and case law on what is viewed as material for public reporting to shareholders under SEC rules. Accordingly, NDIA does not believe further guidance is warranted at this time. Once the SEC and companies have further experience in this area, this area might be revisited.  III.  Lack of Coordination to Protect Law Enforcement and/or National Security Interests: An issue of concern to NDIA is the lack of an exception that would delay reporting of material incidents in cases where disclosure could negatively impact law enforcement or national security. NDIA members are concerned that in the rush to comply with a 4 business day reporting deadline, companies that have experienced cyber incidents impacting classified or controlled unclassified information, or that are involved in law enforcement investigations may be put in an impossible situation. They would have to choose between violating SEC disclosure obligations and violating statutes prohibiting unauthorized disclosures.  3 CORE/9990000.7889/174389242.1 Proposed Solution: NDIA respectfully suggests the inclusion of a provision to allow a delay in reporting of material incidents under certain circumstances. Primarily, this would occur when the company has been informed by government authorities that a delay in disclosure would be in the interest of national security, or an ongoing law enforcement investigation. It would also be useful to clarify that companies do not have an obligation to describe with particularity in their reporting any information related to classified or otherwise controlled information, systems, or programs.  States reporting laws also vary from state to state.  NDIA suggests that the SEC seek to harmonize these varied reporting rules once additional opportunity to observe cyber incident laws and reporting in action. IV.  Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents That Become Material in the Aggregate:  The SECs proposal requiring companies to disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become material in the aggregate creates an ambiguous standard. We believe this to be a highly subjective and potentially imprecise calculation that will prove to be unworkable. Proposed Solution: NDIA respectfully urges the SEC to remove this proposed requirement. V.  Cybersecurity Incidents Have a Scope That is Too Broad:  NDIA notes that the proposed SEC rule defines a cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on, or through, a registrants information systems. The proposed definition of which would include information resources owned or used by the registrant. NDIA believes that this language is problematic because a company may use many systems to process its data, including vendor systems. In such circumstances, in which companies often rely on vendors to inform them of cyber incidents impacting the systems, companies may have particular challenges in obtaining sufficient information from the vendors in time to make their disclosure.  Proposed Solution: In the definition of information systems, NDIA would urge changing owned or used by the registrant to owned or operated by the registrant. This would allow companies to more reasonably obtain sufficient information about incidents on systems that they own or actually operate.  VI. Disclosure of Cyber Expertise of Board Members  NDIA is concerned that it may not be essential that Board members themselves have specialized expertise in cybersecurity. There already is a shortage of personnel with cybersecurity expertise to address ongoing challenges and risks associated with cybersecurity and cybersecurity incident identification, reporting, and remediation. Public companies need 3 CORE/9990000.7889/174389242.1 appropriate oversight by Board members and can hire cyber expertise for specific roles within the company and / or as consultants to the Board where and when needed. VII. Impact of the Proposed Rule on Small Businesses  As the SEC is aware, public companies are not always behemoth corporations. Within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) there are a number of public companies that fall within the micro cap and nano cap range. These companies have less resources than larger companies. The proposed rule notes that there will be a cost impact and that enhanced disclosure could potentially increase the vulnerability of registrants by providing a road map for future attacks. But the proposed rule specifically subjects small businesses to the new requirements The SEC should re consider the impact of the proposed rule on these small businesses which have limited resources to begin with, and may find it more difficult than large companies to identify board members with requisite cyber expertise given that there already is a lack of talent in this area. See VI, above. NDIA requests that the SEC coordinate this reconsideration with the Department of Defense, which has considerable experience with implementing its own cybersecurity rules and understands more fully the impact that such implementation has on small businesses.  VIII. Impact of the Proposed Rule on Different Industries The proposed rule discusses that companies may be under other cybersecurity incident reporting mandates because of their particular industry. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which promulgate standards on cybersecurity applicable to the DIB are mentioned but only in footnotes in the proposed SEC rulemaking. Although other mandates are mentioned, the proposed rule simply notes that there are varying standards and requirements for reporting. The SEC should consider whether it should tailor its mandates to specific industry concerns and approaches. This not only would benefit the industry member companies, but also its investors. NDIA suggests that the SEC consider the potential benefits of seeking alignment with industry specific requirements.  IX. Risk of Third Party Litigation NDIA notes that, while this may be beyond the scope of the current rulemaking, the proposed rule may be the source of third party litigation. That is a significant concern in the DIB where the goal of DIB member public companies is to assist the government with its national security mission. Third party litigation poses challenges and costs that may take up the time and resources of DIB companies, in addition to the other concerns about reporting and safeguarding national security and law enforcement information previous mentioned in these comments.  NDIA and its membership firmly appreciate the SECs desire to enhance cybersecurity related disclosures. We do, however, have significant concerns surrounding certain aspects of these proposed rules. For the reasons alluded to, we respectively suggest changes in light of the unique 3 CORE/9990000.7889/174389242.1 challenges faced by companies that operate in the defense sector. NDIA stands ready to assist in revising and updating these proposals and would welcome this collaboration.  NDIA appreciates the opportunity to address our concerns pertaining to this matter.

We believe the disclosed information will not only better inform investors but also provide incentives for companies to implement effective cybersecurity strategies.  Disclosure regarding the board of directors cybersecurity expertise  CII has previously commented on matters of cybersecurity, specifically on governance structures to mitigate cybersecurity risk.5 We believe that cybersecurity is an integral component of a boards role in risk oversight6, and recently our members voted to incorporate this and to reference material cybersecurity risks in our member approved Corporate Governance Policies.7 The Proposal acknowledges that the expertise of the board in overseeing risk management, strategy and governance decisions around cybersecurity is important information for investors. Directors have the authority, capacity and responsibility to make pivotal contributions in this area by ensuring adequate resources and management expertise are allocated to robust cyber risk management policies and practices, and ensuring disclosure fairly and accurately portrays material cyber risks and incidents.8 To achieve these objectives, directors need to:  Understand managements cybersecurity strategy;   Learn where cybersecurity weaknesses lie and; 3 Press Release 2018 22, SEC Adopts Statement and Interpretative Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/news/press release/2018 22.  4 Cyber Risk Oversight 2020 Key Principles and Practical Guidance for Corporate Boards, by the Internet Security Alliance and NACD, http://isalliance.org/wp content/uploads/2020/02/RD 3 2020 NACD Cyber Handbook WEB 022020.pdf.

Page 3 of 4 May 9, 2022   Support informed, reasonable investment in the protection of critical data and assets.9  To cast informed votes on directors, CII members and other institutional investors need the information described in the Proposal to ensure that their representatives are accomplishing these objectives. Specifically:   We are pleased to see that the Proposed Rules address the role of the board in cybersecurity risk management and strategy in a thorough manner, including disclosure of whether any board member has expertise or experience in cybersecurity.  We support the adoption of proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor, which ensures board members with cybersecurity expertise will not be subject to a higher level of liability than other directors.   We believe disclosing the names of board members with cyber expertise is unlikely to deter such members from performing board service. These skills are highly sought after, and coupled with the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor and the understanding that cybersecurity is the responsibility of the full board, board members with this expertise should not expect higher risk from their service and therefore not be deterred.  We believe that annual disclosure of cyber expertise among board members, if any, in the annual report and proxy would be helpful to investors, especially in voting decisions.  Disclosure of cybersecurity incidents in Form 8 Ks and periodic reports  The Proposal codifies directives in the 2018 Interpretive Release on the timing of filings and the scope of information companies need to relay to investors, markets, peers, customers and regulators when attacks or threats have risen to a material level. In the absence of the more specific requirements in the Proposal, many companies likely will continue to provide inadequate information on their processes, responses and level of vulnerability, as noted in the Proposal.10 The lack of timely, comprehensive disclosure of material cyber events exposes investors and the community at large to potential harm. Specifically:   We agree that investors would benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K.  9 Id.  10 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,603, …the staff has observed certain cybersecurity incidents that were reported in the media but that were not disclosed in a registrants filings. Page 4 of 4 May 9, 2022   We believe the balance between informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants is appropriate.   We believe the exclusion of specific technical information relevant to vulnerabilities and planned responses is appropriate. We are comfortable with the date of initial materiality determination as the defining disclosure trigger.  We do not oppose a delay in filing based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security.  We support disclosure of substantial updates with material changes in continued reporting of prior incidences in Form 8 K. Other updates of non material significance could be accomplished with regularly scheduled filings.   We agree with the requirement to disclose smaller and/or frequent attacks that become material in the aggregate. The Proposal has goals of protecting investors and incenting a more robust framework of cybersecurity defense within our capital markets. As Chair Gensler recently said, Cyber relates to each part of our three part mission: investor protection, facilitating capital formation, and that which is in the middle, promoting fair, orderly, and efficient markets.11 CII agrees.

BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative biotechnology products that will help to solve some of societys most pressing challenges, such as managing the environmental and health risks of climate change, sustainably growing nutritious food, improving animal health, enabling manufacturing processes that reduce waste and minimize water use, and advancing the health of our families.  The biotechnology industry is instrumental in advancing society and is considered a critical technology for American economic security in the new era.2 Accordingly, we agree that cybersecurity is the defining business risk of the digital age. As companies increasingly gather, analyze, and create data derived products, cybersecurity will be central to securing core business operations and competitive moats, and ensuring that stakeholders and shareholders are adequately apprised about this rising threat.  However, BIO urges the Commission and the Administration to take a holistic approach to their regulatory agenda with a particular focus on what this recent wave of regulation means for small  1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposed Rule 2 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp content/uploads/2022/02/02 2022 Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update.pdf  companies, the diminishing incentives to become a public company, and the duplicative nature of reporting that will exist once the Administrations regulatory agenda is fully implemented. The Commission acknowledges that small companies will be disproportionately affected by the rule without specifically noting that small companies are the least likely to be victims of cybersecurity incidents, as detailed in the same academic research the Commission uses as ballast for the economic cost of cyber incidents to markets.3 Summary of Concerns and Recommendations  Many companies already report cyber incidents to various federal, state, local, and international bodies. New laws enacted this year in addition to this proposed rule will dramatically increase the reporting burden for small companies. The proposed rule also threatens to put small companies at odds with law enforcement. The domestic reporting systems should be streamlined and coordinated to reduce the burden and significant costs that will be borne by small companies.  • BIO urges the Commission to coordinate with other federal and state regulators and agencies on current and proposed reporting requirements to have a common set of information to streamline reporting. • BIO urges the Commission to have agency agreements in place with CISA, FTC, and other regulatory agencies that currently require cyber incident reporting to consolidate filing. • BIO urges the Commission to work with the Department of Justice to issue guidance to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for all parties to be aligned with the Commissions standing that federal securities law reporting requirements are distinct from cooperation with law enforcement.  Since the intention of the proposed rule is to drive corporate behavior to implement cybersecurity programs, the Commission should take steps to help small companies mature into this reporting regime and organizational structure. Most private, venture backed companies will not have these structures and personnel in place by the time they would naturally intend to IPO. These requirements, in addition to the other requirements the Commission has proposed and will propose, will disproportionately affect small companies with consequences for capital markets and capital formation in the United States.  3 Supra note 133 in the proposed rule Section C: Potential Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Amendments  • BIO urges the Commission to extend emerging growth company and smaller reporting company exemptions to include cybersecurity management and board disclosures. • BIO urges the Commission and its regulatory partners to provide resources and assistance to small businesses to train executives and management to ensure an equal playing field between small and large companies.  The Impact of Regulation on Small Business Capital Formation  At the end of every bull market comes a wave of regulation meant to curb the perceived excesses of the prior cycle. We are at a similar juncture. The current wave of public company regulation was expected given the end of Internet 2.0 era and as we transition into the new Industrial Age.  There are new threats to our markets and society that require systemic approaches. We urge the Commission to view their regulatory agenda with the hindsight of lessons learned from past waves of regulation, the consequences they had for capital formation and capital markets, and the eventual need to roll back regulations to more meaningful and more effective levels. This proposed rule will compel action which will increase the cost of capital for smaller companies and increase capital expenditure for cybersecurity service providers. The net consequence of heavy regulatory reporting burdens for public companies are two fold. (1) Fewer companies will join public markets, and (2) the companies that do become public will be large. Put another way, more regulation means you create larger companies. This is a natural consequence of requiring more capital to support a larger, more costly operating structure to meet the demands of regulators. This was the result of Sarbanes Oxley. Similarly, in the wake of Dodd Frank financial institutions and asset managers became much larger. As the chart below illustrate, in the wake of Sarbanes Oxley the number of IPOs fell but deal values increased. This means that fewer companies went public, but those that did tended to be large. From the 1990s to the 2000s the number of IPOs fell by more than 60 percent.4 Another way to look at it is by breaking down the deal values by offer size where one can note that since the 1990s the number of companies seeking $1 million to $100 million collapsed.5 Congress had to enact new legislation, most crucially the JOBS Act of 2012, to reignite the IPO market,  4 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg law analysis/analysis three decades of ipo deals 1990 2019 5 Id  particularly for smaller companies. This is concerning given that the JOBS Act is no longer as bipartisan as it once was.   The current wave of regulation is threatening to do the same to capital markets and capital formation. Congress soon will have to enact new ways to incentivize going public because of the significant cost and onerous, duplicative reporting entailed with being a reporting company. Overlapping Reporting and Lack of Law Enforcement Exemptions  As noted in the Commissions proposed rule, most domestic companies must already report to various local, state, and federal agencies and law enforcement when cybersecurity breaches occur. As the Commission duly notes, all 50 states also have their data breach laws as do the different countries in which biotechnology companies typically operate, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union. BIO is troubled by the Commissions declaration that securities law is distinct from obligations to local, state, and federal law enforcement efforts to find and stymie the root cause of cybercrime. This places significant pressure on small companies, who have baseline legal counsel and often outsource more complex legal services, to dramatically increase expenditures when a cyber incident occurs as law enforcement will not take kindly to efforts to circumvent investigations while they are taking place. The Commission should not promulgate rules that will force companies to clash with law enforcement agencies without first having the opinion and support of the Department of  Justice, who should simultaneously issue guidance to ensure that federal, state, and local law enforcement are aware of new obligations and protocols for reporting. While many biotechnology companies do not retain patient records from clinical trials— typically held by academic institutions, healthcare centers, and clinical research organizations— the business model pivot defining the new era entails owning more data. So, biotechnology companies are increasingly having to report under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) using separate reports and systems. Many companies already implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST SP 800 53 and SP 800 137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring) protocols and are audited on ISO 27001 (global information security management standards) compliance. This constitutes four different reporting requirements that are currently in existence for which small biotechnologies may be accountable.  Furthermore, the President just signed into law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), which mandates that all critical infrastructure entities report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on material cybersecurity incidents and ransomware payments. CISA has not yet promulgated any rules pursuant to the CIRCIA.  Companies do not yet know which industries are included under the Act as covered entities reporting cover incidents as both definitions have not yet been defined by the Director of CISA. We can only assume that since the White House has labeled biotechnology as a critical industry and the Presidential Policy Directive 21 from 2013 named healthcare and public health as critical infrastructure that our industry will soon also contend with reporting to CISA.  Having to report simultaneously to four federal agencies in addition to state, local, and international regulators and law enforcement is a significant burden for small companies.  There must be more coordination and data sharing at the federal level with data sharing to states and localities. The Commission should establish agency agreements with CISA and have sharing mechanisms for FTC and HIPAA reporting. The Commission should also work with their law enforcement and regulatory colleagues to create standard templates for reporting to streamline the multiple reporting process. Naming and Shaming and the Cost of Capital for Small Businesses  The Commission acknowledges in the proposed rule that once disclosures are mandated, companies that do not have cybersecurity programs will face a higher cost of capital. The Commission also notes in the proposed rule that the average market capitalization of domestic filers that did not make cybersecurity related disclosures was $2.2 billion.6 This means that micro and small capitalization companies comprise the majority of registrants that did not report cybersecurity related disclosures since $2 billion in market capitalization is the threshold for inclusion in most exchange traded funds that track the small cap sector. Taken together, the SEC is saying that micro and small capitalization companies will face higher cost of capital once this proposed rule is implemented. These companies need exemptions when smaller reporting companies and an onramp to compliance as emerging growth companies.  The Commission cites academic research from Kamiya et al, which suggests that an average value loss of $495 million per attack, inferred by a mean 0.84% abnormal return witnessed in the wake of cybersecurity incident announcements. However, this interpretation by the Commission does not keep with the language and intent of the study. The Commission ignored and omitted the fact that these inferred losses stemming from the observed return implies a mean company market capitalization of $58.9 billion.7 Put another way, cyberattacks mainly affect large companies and are not material for smaller companies. This is corroborated in the same study, which the Commission omitted in its presentation, and states, Our likelihood analysis shows that firms are more likely to experience cyberattacks when they are larger, included in the list of Fortune 500 companies, financially less constrained, more highly valued, and have more intangible assets. We also find that cyberattacks are more likely to occur in firms operating in industries that are less competitive.8 (emphasis ours) 6 Id 7 The Commission cites Kamiya et al., Risk Management, Firm Reputation, and the Impact of Successful Cyberattacks on Target Firms, Journal of Financial Economics 2021 who states Consistent with this expectation, we find a significant mean cumulative abnormal return (CAR) of 0.84% during the three day window around cyberattack announcements for our full sample of personal information loss. With a mean market value of about $58.93 billion for our sample of attacked firms, this translates into an average value loss of $495 million per attack. 8 Id  The Commission is incorrectly suggesting that the significant loss of $495 million on average per incident is systemic, which is not the case. These losses are clearly concentrated in large companies, yet this loss statistic of $495 million has been used to justify compelling sub $2 billion companies to have the same organizational structures, board composition, and capital expenditures for cybersecurity as a $59 billion company.  The Commission also misrepresented the significance of a 0.84% cumulative three day abnormal return following cyber incident announcements.9 This return is well within the standard deviation of returns for the S&P 500 (which has a historical daily standard deviation of 0.98%) and would not be considered significant by most market participants, especially over a period of three consecutive days.10 Furthermore, the same study cited by the Commission, Kamiya et al, found no consistent evidence that the stock price reaction is worse for financially constrained firms.11 Any market practitioner would expect an exogenous shock to affect small cap company share prices more than large cap company share prices given that small cap companies have higher volatility. Put another way, small cap companies have higher betas, which means for one percent move in the S&P 500 small cap companies should experience a greater than one percent move. However, the study suggests that this is not the case for cybersecurity incidents reported. Both large cap and small cap companies experience the same stock reaction to the same shock. This is further evidence that these rules are not germane for small companies. Small companies should be exempt. BIO urges the Commission to extend emerging growth company and smaller reporting company exemptions to include cybersecurity management and board disclosures. BIO urges the Commission to provide emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies with training and resources to meet these new operational and reporting obligations.  9 If a stock had a historical standard deviation of 1% and moved 0.8% on news, most market participants would suggest that the news was either not significant or the market had priced in that news so the reaction was muted.  10 CFA Institute  11 Id  Responses to Key Questions  Q2c: Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? BIO recommends removing the disclosure for remediating cyber incidents from Form 8K as this aspect seems to be covered in Proposed Rule Section C, Disclosure about Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports, mandating disclosure of material changes, additions, or updates to information disclosed on Form 8K in registrants quarterly Form 10Q or annual report Form 10K. Registrants will effectively be responsible for filing updates via Form 8K, Form 10Q, and Form 10K for the same incident. This is a regulatory overcorrection in disclosure and reporting. While there is a current societal trend for requiring information as frequently as possible, the Commission must balance the need for ongoing reports against the cost to registrants of time and resources. The reporting of remediation can be disclosed in Form 10Q with the same level of effectiveness as filing another Form 8K between quarterly reports. Q3: Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example, should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the registrants next periodic report? If so, which disclosures? BIO is concerned with the amount of information that the Commission is proposing to be filed as cyber incidents are being investigated and/or remediated. To report the proposed information publicly would signal to attackers the extent of knowledge regarding the investigation as well as the planned remediation. The resources required to complete Item 1.05, as proposed, would certainly distract from a companys ability to assist law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident, as well as implementation of any mitigation efforts needed to prevent future cybersecurity incidents  Q4: We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?   Filing Form 8K is not a costless exercise with both internal and external costs associated with drafting and filing the form with the Commission. While the biotechnology industry is inherently a heavy user of Form 8K in reporting of clinical trial, regulatory, financing, and other corporate updates, each update can take more than the proposed four days to complete and filing costs are non trivial, especially if a small company must file several updates via Form 8K throughout the process.  The costs will add up per incident over time. Further, as noted in the comments above and in answers further below, the biotechnology industry does not claim domain expertise in cybersecurity of information technology systems. Most biotechnology companies are small companies without the resources to carry a full time cybersecurity expert on staff, much less at the Board or management level. Existing legal and regulatory consultants will have to fill this gap, and the market is currently not prepared to absorb this timeline. Small companies will face unknown expenditures associated with this new filing, including cybersecurity consultants. Q5: Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold? BIO contends that all disclosures should be rooted in the established materiality standard.  Mandating disclosures that are not material to a business introduces costly obligations that may be bore in terms of the direct costs associated with filing immaterial disclosures, indirect costs due to the risks associated with disclosing nontraditional information about a companys inner working, and via the increased cost of capital that will be implied in markets due to the asymmetry of information caused, unduly, by regulatory disclosure predicated on standards other than materiality. Quantifiable triggering mechanisms would be a welcome triggering mechanism for all companies as the materiality of financial affects from exogenous shocks are easy to understand, universally wanted by investors, and universally applicable across industries. An exogenous shock, such as a cyber incident, can be material if one percent or more of companys revenues are affected by the incident.   Q6: To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations Generally, BIO is troubled at the volume of reporting that will have to occur across various federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and regulatory bodies for the same cybersecurity incident. BIO is also concerned with the lack of coordination between domestic federal and state agencies and law enforcement. There must be more law enforcement and regulatory coordination.  The healthcare industry is already responsible for reporting to a panoply of local, state, and federal regulators and law enforcement agencies. The reporting burden will therefore possibly include reporting to securities and health regulators as well as law enforcement in all 50 states as well as six federal agencies. The Commission should work with its federal and state level cybersecurity partners to ensure minimal overlap and efficient reporting mechanisms are in place prior to implementing any reporting rules. Such partnerships should define a clear chain of command in which industry is not inappropriately left to be at conflict with law enforcement or other regulators. Notably, the Commission should establish agency agreements with CISA, FTC, DoJ, and HHS at the federal level before implementing a final rule. Q7: Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security? BIO is highly concerned that the proposed rule is putting registrants on a collision course with law enforcement. The SEC should not knowingly put companies at odds with law enforcement.  Accordingly, the Commission should allow for exemption in cases where the U.S. Attorney General, State Attorney General, or District Attorney requests a delay and in matters where review by law enforcement is still pending. The Commission must work with the Department of Justice in establishing reporting criteria for state and local jurisdictions to use when assessing the law enforcement implications versus the securities reporting requirements for cyber incidents.  Further, before the proposed rule in finalized and implemented the SEC must establish that it is has an agency agreement and sharing mechanism in place with the CISA to ensure that there are no duplicative reporting efforts. BIO also contends that the SEC and CISA should have agency  agreements and sharing mechanisms with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as the FTC already mandates certain data breaches to be reported. The Administration should endeavor to streamline the reporting process so that the most pertinent agency is notified at the earliest opportunity, and that submission should count for all other relevant agencies and regulators.  Q10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? The biotechnology industry is not in the business of providing information technology or information security services. Hence most biotechnology companies outsource this critical function to service providers with expertise. Software infrastructure, utility suppliers, and other service provides should be responsible for the safety, soundness, and reporting of cyber incidents of their products and services. Biotechnology companies, as cyber risk management services customers, are not best situated to understand the nuance of a cyber incident. Biotechnology companies will base their materiality assessments on the assessments and information provided by cyber security service providers. Any delay, omission, misrepresentation, or error on behalf of the provider should not be transferred to the customer of those services and, hence, should be provided with adequate safe harbors. Furthermore, the nature of clinical trials is for biotechnology companies to contract these critical tests out to clinical research organizations and a myriad of other service providers who handle, store, and report patient data, including genomic data. All of these service providers to the biotechnology industry have a duty to report to their customer if any such incident occurs. Customers should not be held liable for reporting breaches or for delays in receiving said reports from service providers.  Customers should not have to monitor EDGAR or social media to determine if a material breach has occurred at a service provider.  The rules should include safe harbors for reporting on incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant for these reasons. Q13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 for failure to timely file a Form 8 K, as proposed? Yes. As with any transition period, there will be a learning curve and companies should have safe harbors to reduce liability. Further, as the pace and sophistication of cyber incidents magnifies, companies should be provided with safe harbor protections when disclosing these events.  Q14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3? Form S3 is instrumental for emerging biotechnology companies that have a consistent cadence for raising capital to start, adjust, and expand clinical trials. As these costs increase over time, public biotechnology companies will only accelerate their use of Form S3 for issuing new securities to raise more capital. BIO supports this safe harbor.  Q15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K in the registrants quarterly or annual report, as proposed? Are there instances, other than to correct inaccurate or materially misleading prior disclosures, when a registrant should be required to update its report on Form 8 K or file another Form 8 K instead of providing disclosure of material changes, additions, or updates in a subsequent Form 10 Q or Form 10 K? BIO cautions the Commission in proposing so many disclosures across different filings. BIO recommends that the Commission implement rules that consider the significant burden of repeated filings. The Commission should pick one relevant filing form for all disclosures. For instance, if the Commission believes that Form 8K strikes the perfect balance between substance and timing, then the Commission should only require registrants to file Form 8K for all matters related to cyber incidents and leave management with the option to discuss incidents in Management Discussion and Analysis sections of Form 10K.  Q16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to  provide disclosure in Form 8 K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate? As noted above, the Commission should pick one specific form for the reporting of cyber related incidents.  Q17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? While BIO understands the need for such disclosures, the Commission is potentially exposing much of the domestic market to cyber criminals if these disclosures are required in the next proxy season.  The Commission acknowledged in the proposed rule that there is a non negligible risk that the reporting of cyber readiness potentially exposes companies to being targeted once there is a disclosure. Given that the research cited by the Commission contends that small companies tend to not have cybersecurity capabilities, one would expect that the lack of cyber readiness would inappropriately expose small companies to this risk as knowledge of their shortcomings becomes widely known. Essentially, the Commission has acknowledged that this will compel companies to implement cybersecurity programs and processes. However, the Commission is not responsible for providing support or guidance. This will require small, pre revenue companies (the majority of listed biotechnology companies) to raise new capital to comply with the Commissions new set of disclosures. Historically, investors are less willing to provide capital to companies to implement regulatory requirements (which constitute a negative return on invested capital) rather than deploying capital to advance the companys core business interest, which in this case is advancing R&D and clinical trials.  Q19. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? No position.  Q22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need  for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? As noted above, there is a non negligible risk that disclosure of cybersecurity programs or consultants may have the unintended consequence of creating new cybersecurity targets, a fact made more concerning given the recent cyber incident incurred at Okta.  Q23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? As detailed in the narrative above, small companies are seldom targets of cybercriminals but will see the most severe direct and indirect costs associated with complying with the rule and increases in their costs of capital. Smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies should be exempt from reporting of Item 6. For instance, a classic biotechnology company running clinical trials should not need to implement new management structures that focus on cybersecurity risks as the company does not host patient data and only runs experiments. The median employee count for BIOs members is 19. This includes executives and R&D personnel, such as researchers and lab technicians. These small biotechnology companies do not have the capacity, nor the business need, to have institutional structures related to the management, planning, oversight, and maintenance of cybersecurity related systems and suppliers. These companies should not have to hire extra employees specifically for the purposes of implementing cybersecurity related programs when their main focus for raising capital is to advance research and development of products whose intellectual property is easily searchable in patent libraries. However, a health technology company that focuses on delivering telehealth or administers decentralized clinical trials may have to report given that their entire business model is gathering, storing, and analyzing customer data. Smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies should be exempt from proposed Item 6. Q24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or asset backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which  would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? Smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies should be exempt from reporting on Item 106(b), Item 106(c), and Item 407(j). At minimum, smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies should be given a phase in period for reporting. BIO believes this is particularly germane given that research indicates that these companies tend to not be targeted by cyber criminals. As noted in the comments above, the current wave of regulatory reporting requirements for public companies has historically led to a decline in IPOs, particularly of small companies seeking additional capital to improve and expand operations. Given that smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies tend to not have mature structures when they IPO, these companies should not be required to disclose proposed Item 106(b) information in registration statements.  Most, if not all, of these companies will be using raised capital to form these corporate structures. BIO remains concerned that the Administration, including the Commission, is not viewing their regulatory plan holistically. Seeking to implement significant changes to disclosure frameworks, all of which will require significant capital to implement, will stifle capital formation as companies looking to IPO will reconsider as they did in the wake of Sarbanes Oxley (as noted above).  Q25. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (Board leadership structure and role in oversight) with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross references in Item 106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? No position.  Q26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way? The proposed Item 407(j) is not helpful as a general regulatory disclosure. As noted above, this will asymmetrically impact smaller companies. The biotechnology industry already has tremendous  difficulty in filing board seats with those that have expertise in biotechnology, clinical trials, and in the sub specialty of the therapeutic target of the company. For example, finding board members that have successful track records running clinical trials and raising capital for companies in amyloid targeting therapeutics in the treatment of Alzheimers disease is remarkably difficult. In addition to this expertise of the therapeutic area (neurology with a focus on dementia), sector (biotechnology), and board role (audit, etc), small biotechnology companies must also work towards finding diverse candidates to fill these board level roles in an industry that suffers a structural deficit in talent, due to nationally low participation rates in STEM education, and specifically in board ready candidates from diverse backgrounds. Finally, with such limited pools of talent, there is significant competition and added complexity from proxies, who limit the number of boards on which a director can sit. While this may be pertinent for larger companies, it is a significant problem for smaller companies.  The Commission is adding to this complexity with the need for cybersecurity expertise. In a separate proposed rule, the Commission is compelling the same need for climate risk expertise. This is not feasible for small biotechnology companies.  As we note above and is implied in the Commissions proposed rule and citations within the proposed rule, smaller companies are not the main targets for cybercriminals. Hence, the proposed Item 407(j) seems more appropriate as a requirement for index inclusion. This is the most efficient mechanism for ensuring that larger companies have board representation for this matter. For example, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, MSCI, Russell, Wilshire, and CRSP Indices can mandate that in order to be included in their respective index, a company must fit the market capitalization and board structure requirements.  Q27. Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)(1)? Would a requirement to name such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving on a board of directors? The cybercriminal industry prides itself on public embarrassment. There is little benefit in providing fodder to those with malicious intent.  Q28. When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors, should the registrant be required to state expressly that this is the case under proposed Item 407(j)(1)? As proposed, we would not require a registrant to make such an explicit statement.   No. This serves no purpose other than naming and shaming.  Q29. Proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to describe fully the nature of a board members expertise in cybersecurity without mandating specific disclosures. Is there particular information that we should instead require a registrant to disclose with respect to a board members expertise in cybersecurity? No position.  Q31. Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants? If so, how? Singling out a person is never a good idea and will bring unwanted attention to a companys oversight structure. How companies handle cybersecurity at the board level need not be detailed. Q32. Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual report and proxy or information statement, as proposed? No position.  Q33. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 407(j) overlap with disclosure required under Item 401(e) of Regulation S K with respect to the business experience of directors? Are there alternative approaches that would avoid duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? There would be significant overlap. The specific expertise attributed to cybersecurity does not need to be its own item.  Q34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity. Should Item 407(j) define the term expertise? If so, how should we define the term? No position.  Q35. Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs, be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure  requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants? As noted above, smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies should be exempt from Item 407(j) disclosure requirements. The cybersecurity risk of a registrant is not ameliorated by the presence of a cybersecurity expert on a board in the same way that clinical trial risk is not ameliorated by the presence of an expert on the board. Q36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should consider? If the Commission moves to implement the rule as written, there should be safe harbors as proposed in Item 407(j)(2).  Q37. As proposed, disclosure under Item 407(j) would be required in a proxy or information statement. Should we require the disclosure under Item 407(j) to appear in a registrants proxy or information statement regardless of whether the registrant is relying on General Instruction G(3)? Is this information relevant to a security holders decision to vote for a particular director? No position.",3
104,"Henry Young, Director, Policy, BSA | The Software Alliance",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128387-291290.pdf,"May 9, 2022 File Number S7 09 22 Vanessa A. Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 Via e mail to rule comment@sec.gov  Dear Ms. Countryman: BSA | The Software Alliance (BSA) appreciates the opportunity to provide the below comments to the Securities and Exchange Commissions (Commission or SEC) Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (Proposed Rule).1 BSA is the leading advocate for the global enterprise software industry before governments and in the international marketplace. Its members are among the worlds most innovative companies, providing the products and services that power governments and businesses. 2 BSAs members offer software that generates efficiencies and promotes trust and security, including cloud computing, customer relationship management, human resources management, and identity and access management products and services. Businesses trust BSA members to securely handle their most sensitive information and to securely support their most critical business functions. BSA supports the continued strengthening of cybersecurity practices across all sectors of the U.S. economy as well as the SECs requirement that registrants make public material information about their enterprises, including information about material cyber incidents. BSA has consistently advocated policies that will strengthen cybersecurity, including as reflected in our BSA Cybersecurity Agenda which we released in October 2021.3 As highlighted there, our priorities to improve cybersecurity include the creation of robust software security, cybersecurity for emerging technologies, modernization of government IT and cybersecurity, interoperable cybersecurity laws and policies across borders, and an effective cybersecurity workforce.  1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590 (Mar. 23, 2022) (Proposed Rule).  2 BSA members include Adobe, Alteryx, Atlassian, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Box, Cisco, CNC/Mastercam, DocuSign, Dropbox, IBM, Informatica, Intel, MathWorks, Microsoft, Okta, Oracle, Prokon, PTC, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Shopify Inc., Siemens Industry Software Inc., Splunk, Trend Micro, Trimble Solutions Corporation, Twilio, Unity Technologies, Inc., Workday, Zendesk, and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. 3 BSA | The Software Alliance, Strengthening Trust, Safeguarding Digital Transformation: BSAs Cybersecurity Agenda (Oct. 12, 2021), available at https://www.bsa.org/files/policy filings/10132021bsacybersecurityagenda.pdf.  2  The Proposed Rule would add to the substantial existing web of state and federal laws related to the reporting and public disclosure of cyber incidents (including the recently passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA)). These state and federal laws are designed, if imperfectly, to balance the interests of all stakeholders, including in national security, consumer and investor protection, law enforcement, and cybersecurity. The Proposed Rule will alter this balance and risks causing significant unintended consequences. As discussed below, for example, the Proposed Rule could inadvertently compromise national security or law enforcement interests, result in investors receiving information about a material cyber incident before affected customers, and disclose sensitive information to the benefit of malicious actors. BSA suggests that the SEC further consider how the Proposed Rule will interact with other cyber incident reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as industry best practices. The SEC should particularly focus on how its regulations weigh the concerns of other cybersecurity stakeholders to ensure its regulations are scoped correctly and do not undermine the SECs ultimate goal. BSA is concerned that the Commissions current approach would have unintended consequences that would undermine both the Commissions goal of maintaining fair markets  a goal BSA supports  and simultaneously degrade a registrants cybersecurity, a registrants customers cybersecurity, law enforcement investigations, national security activity, public safety, and the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly. However, we see opportunities to achieve the SECs goals, while minimizing these negative, unintended consequences, which we identify below. The Commission Should Continue to Support Sound Cybersecurity Risk Management We welcome the Commissions focus on advancing sound cybersecurity risk management. We agree that [i]n todays digitally connected world, cybersecurity threats and incidents pose an ongoing and escalating risk to public companies, investors, and market participants,4 and that [l]arge scale cybersecurity attacks can have systemic effects on the economy as a whole, including serious effects on critical infrastructure and national security.5 Maintaining appropriate technical and administrative controls as part of a comprehensive, risk based cybersecurity risk management program, with effective oversight, is critical to managing cybersecurity risk. Additional public transparency on these key points will both encourage sound practices and help investors make informed judgments about the effectiveness of a registrants cybersecurity risk management program. BSA accordingly supports disclosure of limited relevant information about a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures and its board of directors cybersecurity expertise6 However, if adopted as proposed, certain aspects of the Proposed Rule, namely the requirements related to Form 8 K disclosure, will have unintended consequences that will undermine the SECs goals. We explain our reasoning below and suggest improvements that will achieve the Commissions goal of enhancing and standardizing public company cybersecurity disclosure. The Commission Should Provide Tailored Exceptions To New Disclosure Deadlines Targeted incident reporting can strengthen cybersecurity, particularly when it is part of robust, bidirectional sharing of information between the government and the private sector. For example, we worked closely with Congress and the Administration on the recently passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act,7 which established new requirements for the confidential reporting of incidents  4 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16591. 5 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16592. 6 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16590. 7 Pub.L. 117 103, Division Y. 3  and ransomware payments made by critical infrastructure entities. BSA does not support the public disclosure of vulnerability information, which is discussed further in the section below titled The Commission Should Clarify That Any Incident Disclosure Requirement Does Not Apply To Vulnerabilities. Our engagement included partnering with industry peers to highlight the key elements of an effective cyber incident reporting regime,8 and working with key congressional committees throughout the legislative process to ensure that any legislation advance our shared goal of the increased security of the digital ecosystem.9 Throughout this process, our focus was on ensuring that key government stakeholders learn about cyber incidents in a confidential manner so that they can use their authorities to protect American critical infrastructure, markets, consumers, and other national interests. We agree with the Commission that a cybersecurity incident can be material to a registrant, and that investors should be informed of any material incident, cyber related or otherwise. As the Commission explained in its 2018 interpretive guidance, disclosure of material incidents should be provided in a timely fashion.10 To make this possible, registrants should maintain appropriate and effective disclosure controls and procedures that enable them to make accurate and timely disclosures of material events, including those related to cybersecurity.11 BSA supports this guidance and notes that, pursuant to the guidance, registrants are already expected to disclose material cyber incidents to investors in a timely manner. The Proposed Rule would go further, however, by amending Form 8 K to add a new Item 1.05 requiring specific, detailed disclosure within four business days after a registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident.12 The Commission has not established a sufficient basis for proposing an inflexible deadline for reporting material cyber incidents  reporting that could harm a number of important stakeholders, including registrants investors, cybersecurity risk management efforts, and the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly. While there are situations in which the proposed disclosure requirements would work well, there are also situations, discussed more fully below, in which the unintended impact on registrants, investors, law enforcement, and the health and safety of US persons would outweigh any benefits.13 8 See Industry Coalition Proposes ‘Central Elements for Incident Reporting Legislation Aimed at Critical Infrastructure, Inside Cybersecurity (Oct. 4, 2021), https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily news/industry coalition proposes %E2%80%98central%E2%80%99 elements incident reporting legislation aimed. 9 See, e.g., BSA Welcomes Markup of Cyber Incident Reporting Act (Oct. 6, 2021), https://www.bsa.org/news events/news/bsa welcomes markup of cyber incident reporting act. 10 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 83 Fed. Reg. 8166, 8167 (Feb. 26, 2018) (2018 Guidance). 11 Id. 12 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16595. 13 The Commission has not adequately explained, for example, why cybersecurity should be treated differently from the many other critical issues that may rise to the level of a material event requiring disclosure, but that are not subject to specific Form 8 K disclosure requirements. For example, the Commission does not explain why product defects or recalls would not receive equivalent treatment, or why a disaster workplace safety incident is not subject to equivalent express requirements. Nor has the Commission adequately addressed the complex security issues raised by inflexible cyber incident public disclosure requirements, including risks that premature disclosure would present to national security, the safety of our Nations critical infrastructure, the integrity of law enforcement investigations, and risks of disruption to fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Indeed, as noted above, Congress recently required confidential reporting of certain cyber incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and, through CISA, notification to other key agencies within the Federal Government. Congress did not choose to impose inflexible deadlines for public disclosure of such incidents. The Commission 4  The Commission Should At Minimum Allow Reasonable Flexibility In Material Cyber Incident Disclosure To Prevent Severe Unintended Consequences There are several categories of situations in which an inflexible disclosure rule would create significant, unintended harms. In our view, these harms can be minimized by adding a tailored, balancing test as an exception.  The Commission asked in the proposing release: Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents?14 The answer is unequivocally yes, but future cybersecurity incidents are just one of risks that would be created if the Proposed Rule is adopted without the modification we propose in this section. The consequences of premature disclosure (i.e., disclosure that would not occur on a four business day timeline if appropriate consideration were given to the full balance of relevant interests) would, in certain instances, include: • Substantial harm to national and homeland security, law enforcement investigations, and other aspects of the public interest: o Cybersecurity incidents can put national security interests at risk. For example, an attack on a defense contractor might implicate the confidentiality or integrity of systems that hold sensitive government information. Likewise, an attack on a critical infrastructure provider may lead to the loss of critical functions across a particular region within the United States. In those cases, numerous government agencies with national security and homeland security missions are likely to be heavily involved in the response to the incident. Managing the public disclosure of the incident will likely be an issue of top priority for those government agencies, as premature disclosure could cause the malicious actor to expedite or escalate its attack, lead to misinformation or panic, or have other negative consequences. o Law enforcement agencies investigate cyber incidents, gathering information about malicious actors so that they can bring prosecutions, use civil or criminal tools to take down botnets or other malicious systems, or take other appropriate legal action. Premature public disclosure of an incident will disrupt some ongoing investigations, depriving law enforcement agencies of the time they need to take actions that will help the American public. o The public itself may be harmed directly by premature disclosure of a cyber incident, (let alone information related to a vulnerability, discussed further below). Customers and other members of the public may be injured by any action that prompts a malicious actor to accelerate their attack or that encourages another malicious actor to attack the company, or another company using the same exploit. Possible examples are innumerable, including premature disclosure that triggers a malicious actor exfiltrating personal data, disabling a registrants information systems, or otherwise attacking devices on which customers rely (e.g. connected medical devices, communications systems, etc.). o The public interest in information sharing also may be harmed by a regulatory requirement that mandates a specific timeframe for public disclosure of material cyber  should not impose such incident disclosure deadlines by rule here; the known risks are too great to justify any anticipated benefits. 14 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16597. 5  incidents. As noted above, cybersecurity information sharing can be a valuable part of an effective national cybersecurity strategy. For example, CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation regularly inform companies when the agencies identify activity indicating that the company has been the victim of a cyber incident. But government agencies may determine not to share information about ongoing incidents with a victim company if those agencies know that the victim company is required to publicly disclose that valuable intelligence on a short and mandatory timeline. Additionally, companies often share valuable cyber threat indicators with the US Government pursuant to written agreements and through CISAs processes, in both cases, information is typically shared subject to defined confidentiality protections. Such sharing programs help government agencies and companies detect, protect and respond to malicious cyber activity. But the timeline for mandatory public disclosure in the proposed rule may chill this sharing as the registrant in a position to share information will be concerned about starting the clock for mandatory public disclosure. As a result, a mandatory incident disclosure requirement is likely to degrade the necessary collaboration between private sector and government partners. • Substantial harm to registrants: o Premature disclosure of an incident — particularly before a registrant has successfully responded to a malicious actors access to its network — could cause substantial negative consequences for a registrant because it would alert the malicious actor that the registrant is aware of their malicious actions. For example, public disclosure of the incident may provoke the malicious actor to expedite its attack, such as by exfiltrating data in a manner that the registrant could have prevented if it had more time to respond to the incident. Likewise, public disclosure may provoke a malicious actor to undertake destructive attacks, such as by encrypting or destroying customer data, again in a manner that the registrant could have prevented with more time.  o Premature disclosure of an incident likewise could cause substantial negative consequences for a registrant because it could encourage other malicious actors to attack the company or use similar exploits on other companies. If the registrant has not been able to secure its systems in time, it may be subject to multiple successful attacks, dramatically expanding the negative consequences that it may face. • Substantial harm to investors: o Investors will bear the ultimate financial consequences of unnecessary losses imposed upon a registrant because of premature disclosure of a material cyber incident. While cyber incident disclosures may be intended to alert investors to material information, investors should not have any potential loss compounded by regulatory requirements that expand the cyber risks to registrants after an incident. o Premature disclosure of cyber incidents will disrupt the fair, orderly, and efficient operation of the market, hurting investors. Importantly, in many instances, a registrant will likely be able to determine that a cyber incident is material but not be able to discover accurate, complete, or even useful information about the material cyber incident to disclose within four days. Such disclosure, which would occur when the full consequences of the incident are unknown and before a registrant has reasonable time to respond to or recover from the material cyber incident, will result in investors making decisions based on information that almost certainly will be incomplete and will have a 6  significant likelihood of being inaccurate, resulting in market distortions that hurt investors. We certainly support requirements to provide investors timely information about the cybersecurity policies of the companies in which they invest, including whether they are victims of material cyber incidents. Mere engagement with law enforcement or other government agencies about a material cyber incident does not justify delay in providing such notification to investors. Investors loss of confidence in the companys cyber risk management also clearly would not be a sufficient basis to justify a delay in disclosure.  It is critical, however, that the SEC recognizes that in many instances a registrant will not be able to discover accurate, complete, or even useful information within four days of determining it is the victim of a material cyber incident. Therefore, if the Commission requires public disclosure of a material cyber incident on Form 8 K, it should create an exception that allows companies, under appropriate circumstances, to delay disclosure of an incident when premature disclosure can be reasonably anticipated to cause substantial negative consequences to a registrants cybersecurity, a registrants customers cybersecurity, law enforcement investigations, national security activity, public safety, and the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly. Specifically, the Commission should create a new Item 1.05(c) as an exception to Item 1.05(a).15 That new exception would read:  No disclosure shall be required if the registrant: (a) determines that disclosure of a material cyber incident would be reasonably anticipated to cause substantial harm to registrants cybersecurity, the registrants customers cybersecurity, law enforcement investigations, national security activity, public safety, or the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly; (b) documents its reliance on this exception, including any consultation with appropriate law enforcement and government agencies, as appropriate; and (c) assesses, regularly, the applicability of this exception. We believe this is a reasonable approach as it would require a registrant to make a formal determination that it reasonably anticipates its disclosure of the material cyber incident would cause substantial harm. We accordingly ask the Commission to allow registrants to make such a reasoned judgment, document their determination, and regularly revisit the applicability of this exception. The Commission Should, If It Requires Public Disclosure, Reduce the Information It Proposes Registrants Report on Form 8 K The Commission proposes registrants report: (i) When the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; (ii) A brief description of the nature and scope of the incident; (iii) Whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose; (iv) The effect of the incident on the registrants operations; and (v) Whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. The Commission proposed to do require these disclosures because it believes that this information would provide timely and relevant disclosure to investors and other market participants (such as financial analysts, investment advisers, and portfolio managers) and enable them to assess the possible effects of a material cybersecurity incident on the registrant, including any long term and short term financial effects or operational effects. BSA is concerned that, in some circumstances, publicly disclosing information as extensive as the SEC proposes might itself be detrimental to the registrants cybersecurity, the registrants customers cybersecurity, law enforcement investigations, national security activity, public safety, and the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly. Again, assuming that a registrant would be in a position to know  15 A corresponding change would also need to be made to Item 1.05(a). For example, it could be revised to begin Except as provided in section (c), if the registrant experiences . .  7  of and report any of this information within four days of determining that it was a victim of a material cyber incident, publicly disclosing this information would signal to the malicious actor that the registrant is aware of its actions, how much the registrant knows about the actions, whether the registrant believes it has effectively responded to the malicious actor or whether the registrant believes the malicious actor is still in the registrants systems, among other things. In turn, publicly disclosing this information could provoke the malicious actor to exfiltrate data, destroy devices, or otherwise interrupt the registrants activities because the malicious actor would know from the required public disclosure that the registrant was aware of its malicious actions. Further, four days is likely not sufficient time for a registrant to respond to an incident, for example, by backing up data. For example, backing up data may be a critical action to take in response to a cyber incident and the inability to do so before publicly disclosing a material cyber incident, could cause irreparable harm. Additionally, a registrants public disclosure of this type of information may have negative consequences on other organizations, because if a malicious actor is informed by a publicly filed Form 8 K that one company is aware of its actions, the malicious actor would expect that in the near future both government agencies and other companies will identify its tactics, techniques, and procedures and consequently, the malicious actor will likely expedite its activities on other networks, including destroying information and information systems. Finally, required public disclosure will also impede law enforcement investigations, which often rely on the cooperation of registrants, making it even harder for law enforcement agencies to bring malicious actors to justice. Rather, BSA suggests that, if the SEC requires the public disclosure of a material cyber incident on Form 8 K, the SEC provide a registrant flexibility both on the timing and substance of the public disclosure. Public disclosure of information about a material cyber incident risks negatively impacting the registrants cybersecurity, the registrants customers cybersecurity, law enforcement investigations, national security activity, public safety, and the cybersecurity ecosystem more broadly. However, providing a registrant temporal and substantive flexibility to report material information would allow the SEC to achieve its mission while limiting risk associated with public disclosure of information surrounding a cyber incident. The Commission Should Clarify That Any Incident Disclosure Requirement Applies Only To Companies For Which the Cyber Incident is Material, Not Third Party Service Providers The Commission correctly acknowledges the important role that third party service providers play for American businesses and government agencies. For example, cloud based services, including many offered by BSA member companies, are integral and vital elements of all areas of American enterprise, from the support of corporate functions to the operation of critical infrastructure. Providers of these third party services accordingly have extensive experience responding to incidents and notifying affected customers once the key facts are understood and actionable information can be provided. This approach is typically reflected in contract, which balance the third party service providers need to gather and provide meaningful information in an orderly and coordinated way with the customers need to understand the risk and consequences of an incident in a timely manner. Under this approach, the third party service provider evaluates and meets any disclosure or notification obligations based on the impact of the incident on the customers specific business. For example, in the event of an incident involving a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider, a cyber incidents impacts may be material to one customer but not to a second customer  and importantly, the SaaS provider would not have relevant information to determine if the impact of a cyber incident is material.  The Commission should support this established approach to the extent that it chooses to treat material cyber incidents differently than other material events and impose any specific cyber incident disclosure requirement by rule. To do so, the Commission should clarify that any specific cyber incident disclosure requirement applies to end user businesses, not to third party service providers. Any other approach could create chaos in the event of an incident involving a third party service provider. Take the hypothetical example, flagged above, of an incident involving a SaaS provider, though note that this is 8  true for third party service providers more generally. If the SaaS provider were required to publicly disclose the incident through an 8 K filing, rather than permitted to notify its customers in an orderly manner, the SaaS providers customers would have to make their own determinations of materiality without access to sufficient information about the incident its SaaS provider disclosed. The end result could be an over disclosure of cyber incidents, disrupting the marketplace, creating unnecessary noise that would confuse companies and investors alike and potentially companies taking costly and unnecessary prophylactic steps including stopping the use of important systems. This ambiguity would exacerbate the consequences of the incident — and without reason. Such a scenario would also amplify the potential negative consequences of a ransomware attack to which a registrant may be actively responding.  The Commission should avoid such unintended consequences by supporting the cooperative and agreed upon approach through which third party service providers currently report cyber incidents to their customers. This complex area is covered by contracts between a third party service provider and its customer, and frequently the third party service provider has no knowledge of or relationship to its customers end user. Upsetting the current situation would greatly increase complexity and uncertainty without improving either market fairness or cybersecurity. The Commission should avoid such unintended consequences by clarifying and supporting the continued reporting of incidents by third party service providers to their customers, consistent with contractual arrangements. The Commission Should Clarify That Any Incident Disclosure Requirement Does Not Apply To Vulnerabilities The Proposed Rule would define a cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrants information systems or any information residing therein.16 This definition is anchored by the concept of an occurrence, i.e., an event that has occurred. We accordingly understand the Commission to intend for this provision to cover incidents as they are broadly understood within the cybersecurity community  i.e., events that impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.17 For example, this would typically include an attack by a malicious actor that compromises an online database, an email account, or other information system. In contrast, we understand this definition not to include a vulnerability that a malicious actor could attempt to exploit in a future attack, which, if successful, could become a cyber incident. It is important to distinguish information regarding cyber incidents from information regarding the underlying vulnerabilities that a malicious actor may leverage in the incident. Vulnerabilities are found routinely and mitigated based on industry best practices and international standards for coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD). While the software industry works diligently to find and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, and customers patch their systems regularly to address identified vulnerabilities, malicious actors sometimes exploit vulnerabilities, which can lead to a material cyber incident. Generally, absent information on broad exploitation in the wild, information concerning  16 Proposed Rule, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16619 and 16622. 17 Other definitions in statutes and standards are in line with this understanding. See, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 659(a)(5) (the term incident means an occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information on an information system, or actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, an information system;); National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Security Resource Center, Glossary: Incident (An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.), https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/incident. 9  vulnerabilities (which do not amount to a cyber incident or material cyber incident) is kept in strict confidence, during the CVD process, until mitigations are publicly available. Both government agencies and industry keep this confidence to reduce the risk this sensitive vulnerability information will be exploited by malicious actors to harm a governments, businesses, or individuals. This practice, to maintain vulnerability information in strict confidence prior to mitigations being developed and made available is embodied in international standards for CVD, e.g. ISO/IEC 30111 and 29147. These standards were endorsed by Congress in the recently passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, Division Y, H.R. 2471 (P.L. 117 103), which directs the Director of CISA to develop principles that govern the timing and manner in which information relating to security vulnerabilities may be shared, consistent with common industry best practices and United States and international standards.  This approach is the correct one and should be preserved if the Commission decides to impose specific requirements for reporting a material cyber incident by rule. Security vulnerabilities  i.e., attribute[s] of hardware, software, process, or procedure that could enable or facilitate the defeat of a security control18  should be disclosed through companies existing vulnerability management and disclosure programs according to industry best practices and international standards. As we have previously stated, the guiding principle of [coordinated vulnerability disclosure] is that the public is best served when vulnerabilities are reported directly to vendors that can fix them and when public disclosures are delayed until the vendor has had an opportunity to develop, test, and deploy a patch to mitigate the underlying vulnerability.19  The Commission would up end effective vulnerability disclosure programs by requiring vulnerability disclosures in the same manner as incident disclosure. Such an approach could have catastrophic security consequences: since vulnerabilities can take months to patch in some cases, premature public disclosure would alert malicious actors to the vulnerability and facilitate their attacks. As noted above, we understand the Commission not to intend to require such vulnerability disclosure under the Proposed Rule. We would ask the Commission to expressly confirm that this rule does not deviate from a registrants requirement to report material events rather than potential events, in any final rule, however, to avoid any potential uncertainty.20  18 6 U.S.C. § 1501(17). 19 See BSA, Guiding Principles for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (2019), https://www.bsa.org/files/policy filings/2019globalbsacoordinatedvulnerabilitydisclosure.pdf.  20 The Commission notes in the Proposed Rule, for example, that the 2018 Interpretive Release reminds companies, their directors, officers, and other corporate insiders of the need to comply with insider trading laws in connection with information about cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches. 87 Fed. Reg. at 16594. While we do not believe that the Commission intends to treat vulnerabilities in the same manner as incidents, for the avoidance of doubt, we would ask that the Commission clarify that it views vulnerabilities as a risk, and does not view the category of incidents as including vulnerabilities and breaches.  10  *** BSA is committed to working with the Commission to identify and address challenges relating to the appropriate disclosure of cybersecurity risks, incidents, expertise, and governance. We look forward to this continued collaboration.  Sincerely,  Henry Young Director, Policy",3

We support the submission of the American Council of Life Insurers to this consultation, and respectfully submit this additional letter for your consideration.  Sun Life is a leading financial services organization providing insurance, wealth, and asset management solutions to individual and corporate clients in several countries around the world. Through SLC Management, our affiliated asset management business, we are a large asset manager with experience in fixed income, real estate, infrastructure, and alternative credit. We welcome the SECs attention toward ensuring that investors have access to decision useful information on how companies are effectively managing risks from cybersecurity attacks. This is a concern deeply held by Sun Life as an investor. As an issuer, data security is key to our value proposition. Our clients trust us with their sensitive health and financial data. We cannot deliver value to our clients if we do not have their trust. We are continually evolving our cyber defenses to be effective against emerging cybersecurity threats. We are also delivering comprehensive training on data protection to our employees, contractors, and advisors, implementing new security safeguards and embedding privacy protection in our culture and processes. As a Canadian headquartered company, we are subject to strict regulatory obligations concerning cyber risk management and incident reporting by securities regulators. The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued comprehensive guidance that lays out clear expectations for issuers to provide risk disclosure if they are exposed to material cyber risks and develop cyber attack remediation plans that include disclosure guidelines for material cyber attacks. In addition, many Canadian multinationals are supervised by regulators that issue cybersecurity frameworks and requirements that are tailored to their size and industry. Our federal regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has taken several steps to ensure Canadian financial institutions are resilient to cyber attacks. Some of these measures include:  § piloting intelligence led cyber resilience testing to test the cyber resiliency of institutions. § publishing an updated cyber security self assessment tool and enhanced Technology & Cyber Incident Advisory reporting requirements; and § updating Draft Guideline B 13, Technology and Cyber Risk Management that sets out expectations for technology and cyber risk management.  Finally, many Canadian companies can report cybersecurity incidents to Canadas cryptologic agency, the Communications Security Establishment through the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security. Due to the significant regulatory obligations Canadian companies are already subject to, we urge the SEC to continue to permit eligible Canadian foreign private issuers to follow domestic disclosure standards and documents to satisfy the Commissions requirements and to make any compliance with SEC rules strictly voluntary for MJDS filers.  Not doing so would subject Canadian companies to additional incident reporting regimes that would distract critical resources with fulfilling reporting obligations rather than focusing on addressing a cybersecurity incident. In addition, duplicative disclosure requirements would increase the regulatory burden on companies without necessarily meeting the SECs aims.  We encourage the SEC to work closely with Canadian regulators to resolve any concerns with existing cybersecurity reporting regimes before imposing additional reporting requirements. Cross border regulatory cooperation is a powerful tool to support regulators seeking to fulfill their mandate while also minimizing disruption to businesses. We look forward to working collaboratively with the SEC on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is any way we can be of further assistance.  Sincerely,  Abhay Raman, SVP & Chief Information Security Officer",1
106,The Cybersecurity Coalition,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20128403-291315.pdf,"1  May 9, 2022 Via e mail: rule comment@sec.gov Vanessa Countryman, Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 0609  Security and Exchange Commission proposed rule regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File S7 09 22 Dear Secretary Countryman:  The Cybersecurity Coalition (Coalition) submits these comments in response to the proposed rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Coalition appreciates the opportunity to comment on the SECs Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposal, and believes that the commentary offered will be helpful to the SEC in understanding the cybersecurity industrys perspective on several key elements of the proposed amendments.  The Coalition is composed of leading companies specializing in cybersecurity products and services dedicated to finding and advancing consensus policy solutions that promote the development and adoption of cybersecurity technologies.1 We seek to ensure a robust marketplace that will encourage companies of all sizes to take steps to improve their cybersecurity risk management. We are supportive of efforts to identify and promote the adoption of cybersecurity best practices, information sharing, and voluntary standards throughout the global community. Many Coalition members are publicly traded. In general, the Coalition is supportive of the effort being put forward and the issues it seeks to address. The Coalition is also appreciative of the former SEC interpretive guidance on disclosure obligations related to cybersecurity risks, and would recommend an approach that can maintain consistency with such guidance. However, several areas that suggest a slightly more prescriptive approach to reporting can present cyber risk, and we identified these concerns below.  As an additional resource, the Coalition is pleased to provide the SEC with an overview of our prior position underlining several key principles for cyber incident reporting regimes. These  1 The views expressed in this comment reflect the consensus views of the Coalition, and do not necessarily reflect the views of any individual Coalition member. For more information on the Coalition, see www.cybersecuritycoalition.org 2 principles are generally reflected in the recently passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). They include: • Establishing feasible reporting timelines of no less than 72 hours of determination of a significant or material incident2 for reporting incident information in confidence, while allowing for supplemental reporting as more information becomes known. • Limiting reporting to verified incidents • Limiting reporting obligations to the victim organization rather than third parties • Harmonizing federal cybersecurity incident reporting requirements • Ensuring confidentiality and nondisclosure of incident information provided to the government • Balancing the urgency to notify with the need to provide accurate information • Reporting should complement, not compete with, the incident response procedures of victim entities, or otherwise subject victim entities to additional risk.  Detailed below are the Coalitions responses to specific questions as numbered within the proposed rule.  1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?  A) The Coalition believes that cybersecurity is increasingly important to investors and business operations. Current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents may provide additional transparency to investors regarding the registrants cyber resiliency, and effects of the incident on finances and operations. However, requiring registrants to publicly disclose incidents prior to remediation of the incident may undermine cybersecurity, and creates risks to companies, investors, and consumers. We detail these concerns below.  2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident that Item 1.05 should require? A) In general, the Coalition has significant reservations about Item 1.05 requiring that registrants incident disclosures address specifically whether an incident is ongoing  2 72 hours represents the minimum amount of time that is required for a victim to report an incident in the context of the CIRCIA (certain incident information which is reported in confidence). The Coalition acknowledges that collecting sufficient and complete information to conduct the materiality assessment can entail a longer timeline which start may commence after the remediation is concluded. We expand on the issue below. This is important, since determinations conducted in premature stages may result in providing misleading, inaccurate, or not useful information that puts other parties at risk  given the nature of this information. 3 and whether an incident has been remediated. The Coalition appreciates the SECs acknowledgment that registrants are not expected to disclose specific technical information in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident, but the Coalition is nevertheless concerned that requiring a public acknowledgment that an incident is ongoing and less than fully remediated would be contrary to cybersecurity best practices, and may put SEC registrants and their investors  and the ecosystem and nation at large  at unnecessary additional risk. Accordingly, the Coalition believes the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures should be refined to promote security interests while still providing necessary transparency to investors. Ideally, and in accordance with long established cybersecurity best practices, limited (if any) information should be publicly disclosed about incidents that have yet to be remediated. There are a few specific exceptions to this principle, but the Coalition believes the SECs disclosure rule should adhere to this best practice.  In any event, the Coalition emphatically supports the removal of any requirement to specifically disclose an incidents remediation status on Form 8 K. Rather, the rule should permit registrants flexibility to determine the level of specificity that is appropriate for public consumption in light of active security risks, and to withhold certain details (such as the incomplete status of remediation), or perhaps delay detailed disclosure altogether, if the registrant reasonably believed disclosure of certain details would exacerbate the material impact of the incident. 3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures, or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example, should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the registrants next periodic report? If so, which disclosures? A) The Coalition generally supports the SECs goal to inform investors of material cybersecurity incidents in a consistent and timely manner. The Coalition also applauds that the SECs proposed rule states that disclosures need not disclose specific technical information that would impede cybersecurity activities like incident response. 3  However, while disclosure of a remediated cyber incident is possible four days after a materiality determination, disclosure of an ongoing cyber incident creates new risks. As noted above, the Coalition is against any mandatory public revelations about incidents that are ongoing, or where remediation efforts are incomplete. This would be against established best practices, and has the potential to worsen a cybersecurity incident for both the victim registrant and investors. 3 Pg. 21. While registrants should provide disclosure responsive to the enumerated items to the extent known at the time of filing of the Form 8 K, we would not expect a registrant to publicly disclose specific, technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail as would impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident. 4 Requiring detailed disclosure on a current basis on Form 8 K may result in registrants revealing the existence of a cybersecurity incident before such incident is fully mitigated or remediated, and the impacted information system fortified against similar threats. In addition, the proposed rule would require a registrant to disclose whether or not the incident has been remediated, which has the effect of calling out the status of the registrants ability to remediate the incident at a time when the registrant is at its most vulnerable state. The nature of the proposed current reporting could unintentionally invite additional threat actors to take advantage of the vulnerability, resulting in additional harm to registrants and their investors. In most cases, if a registrant experiences a cybersecurity incident, it is in the best interests of the registrant and its investors for the registrant to focus on identifying and remediating the incident prior to public disclosure of the incident. Finding the appropriate balance between cybersecurity and transparency is a difficult problem that may not have an elegant solution. However, the SEC should consider possible options for modifying its proposal to avoid creating additional risks. This may include permitting registrants to delay the filing of Form 8 K concerning a material cybersecurity incident until it has been remediated. Circumstances that could justify such delay include where the registrant is actively pursuing timely mitigation of the incident, but cannot reasonably complete that process within four days of a materiality determination, and the registrant reasonably believes public disclosure of the incident prior to mitigation would exacerbate the material impact of the incident. If the SEC maintains that current, detailed reporting is required in all cases, then 8 K disclosures on cybersecurity incidents should not require the disclosure of the status of mitigation or remediation, and registrants should be afforded significant latitude as to the substance and detail of such disclosures, to minimize the risk to the registrant and investors alike. Registrants should not be required or advised to report specifics of unmitigated vulnerabilities or ongoing cybersecurity incidents.  4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures? A) To the extent Form 8 K reporting is required, the Coalition believes that the four business day filing deadline from the point that a registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident is adequate for incidents that have been remediated as it is consistent with global best practices. At a minimum, registrants should never be required to report sooner than 72 hours after a covered incident is confirmed. This timeframe is reflected in numerous national and international reporting regimes such as the European Unions (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), New York 5 States (NYS) Part 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (23 CRR NY 500), The Australian Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Act 2021, and others.4, 5, 6  Remediated cyber incidents may be appropriately disclosed under Form 8 K within four days of the materiality determination, but registrants should be provided additional time to remediate the incident before public disclosure if necessary. While registrants may be capable of preparing the disclosure within four business days, the Coalition has concerns that the public disclosure of a yet to be remediated cyber incident will create new cybersecurity risks for registrants and investors. Our concerns and proposed alternatives are detailed above. It should also be noted that cybersecurity incidents affecting registrants may become public through the press or other third parties when no 8 K has been filed, and any such mismatch between newsworthiness and materiality is neither unexpected nor unique to cybersecurity matters. For example, there may be incidents that the press or other third parties deem significant or otherwise of interest for a variety of reasons, but that the registrant has reasonably determined does not meet the materiality threshold for investors at the time, or possibly ever. The SEC should not expect or conclude that press or other third party statements about cybersecurity incidents, which could be unsubstantiated and based on speculation rather than fact, create a presumption that a Form 8 K will be filed. Form 8 Ks will not necessarily match the public record for cybersecurity incidents, and such a mismatch should not be considered indicative of a registrant failing its reporting obligations.  5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold?  A) The Coalition is supportive of the SECs proposal to define the triggering event for any required non periodic reporting as the date on which a registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident it has experienced is material.7 This definition aligns with the principle of balancing the urgency of submitting an incident notification with the need for accurately assessing an incidents significance.  4 https://gdpr info.eu/ 5https://www.governor ny.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Cybersecurity_Requirements_Financial_Services_23N YCRR500.pdf 6 https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021A00124 7 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf 6 Public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents before a materiality determination has been made risks needlessly confusing investors by inundating them with reports of cybersecurity incidents that are later assessed to have had no meaningful impact. The additional reports that would be created by earlier disclosures would likely misrepresent the quantity and significance of cybersecurity incidents to investors in a way that would hinder their ability to make informed decisions and potentially cause investor under or over reactions that may result in mispricing of securities. In relation to significance, the Coalition supports the use of the materiality standard. The materiality standard is a well established concept that is familiar to SEC registrants and it provides adequate flexibility for assessing various types of cyber related incidents. We would recommend against creating a new standard for cybersecurity incidents that is distinct from the materiality standard used for other required disclosures. It is not clear that expected costs or any other threshold or methodology would be more consistent or easier to apply.  6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations while providing these timely disclosures to investors? What costs would registrants face in determining the extent of a potential conflict?  A) The Coalition is aware of the growing number of disparate federal and state cyber incident reporting regimes, including the recent CIRCIA. Variations among cyber incident reporting regimes strain organizations who must ensure they comply with different definitions of covered incidents, reporting timelines, reporting content requirements, reporting formats, and more. That is in addition to the deconfliction process of understanding how various cyber incident reporting regimes affect an organizations obligation to other laws and regulations. This is why the Coalition supported the recent CIRCIAs creation of a Cyber Incident Reporting Council to coordinate, deconflict, and harmonize Federal incident reporting requirements, including those issued through regulations.8  The Coalition is not in the position to outline how all the various combinations of reporting regimes may create conflicts for registrants. However, the Coalition strongly urges the harmonization of these cyber incident reporting regimes where possible, and encourages the SEC to assess existing regimes, and to work with the Cyber Incident Reporting Council to maximize alignment. This is true in particular where requirements can be in direct conflict (e.g., disclose information to the public at large, compared to maintaining it in confidence, as required by security best practices).  8 https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2471/BILLS 117hr2471enr.pdf 7  7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security?  A) The Coalition believes the Attorney General, or their designee, should have the ability to request a delay in reporting a cybersecurity incident in the interest of national security. Any cybersecurity incident that rises to the level of national security concern would plausibly put investors at far greater risk if disclosed than if investors were delayed in receiving a cybersecurity incident disclosure. In such instances, the security of the nation and of all investors should be prioritized.  8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt?  A) The Coalition is supportive of a flexible instruction to make a materiality determination as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. We caution against imposing a specific timeframe on the materiality determination, because of the high degree of variability in cybersecurity incidents. Each cybersecurity incident is unique and the number of variables that impact the materiality calculus does not lend itself to a more defined approach. As the Coalition stated in the principles above, the urgency to report must be balanced with the need for accuracy, and reporting should complement, not compete with, the registrants incident response activities. Each registrants combination of systems, structure, policies and procedures, cybersecurity maturity, line of business, and available resources is unique, and each will affect the speed at which a cybersecurity incidents materiality can be determined. Likewise, the type and sophistication of a cybersecurity incident can vary greatly and may add significant complexity to the determination process. Providing further guidance and suggested timeframes risk registrants feeling obligated to adjust response procedures to make a determination to the detriment of remediation efforts. Such an outcome would represent additional risk to the registrant and its investors. Additionally, such guidance may lead registrants to report when they have insufficient evidence to make an accurate judgment on the materiality of a cybersecurity incident. This may lead to overreporting of non material cybersecurity incidents or lead to underreporting of material cybersecurity incidents. Furthermore, it risks creating unrealistic expectations for investors who may feel deceived or misled when incident reporting falls outside of the guidance or examples provided by the SEC. It is in the best 8 interest of the registrant and investors for the registrant to follow best practices to identify and remediate the incident and not make a premature materiality determination.  10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties?  A) The Coalition strongly opposes the notion that the definition of cybersecurity incident should cover anything other than a registrants own information systems. This is in line with the principle that third party reporting should be avoided. While registrants may have some visibility into a cybersecurity incident that affects information resources, they use but do not own, only the owner of the information system itself is in a position to assess the full implications of the incident. This is especially true for complex cloud environments. A specific concern is the inclusion of used by in relation to the proposed definition of information systems, which risks inaccurate disclosures due to a registrants lack of information or knowledge concerning an incident. This may create confusion for investors about the nature of an incident. Furthermore, it may introduce friction and distrust between registrants and their IT vendors, to the detriment of investors. The Coalition recommends replacing used by with operated by within the proposed definition.  14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3? A) The Coalition agrees with the SECs view that a failure to timely file a Form 8 K should not result in the loss of a registrants S 3 eligibility. Given the complexity surrounding cybersecurity detecting, analyzing, and remediating cybersecurity incidents (including as to materiality determination), and the harsh consequences to a registrant from losing S 3 eligibility, it is not in the best interests of investors for a registrant to lose S 3 eligibility.  9 17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? A) The Coalition recommends the SEC replace item 106(b)(1)(i) with the following: • The registrant has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and, if so, whether it uses best practices and standards to identify and protect against cybersecurity risks and to detect and respond to cybersecurity events, and if not provide a description of the program.  The Coalition believes it would be useful for investors to know whether the registrants risk assessment program follows risk management best practices and standards to control or mitigate risks. If a registrant is not following an established set of best practices and standards, then the registrant should describe the nature of their cybersecurity program. The Coalition believes Item 106(b) and (c), and this proposed change supports the intent of the proposed rule to provide decision useful information concerning whether and how a registrant is managing cybersecurity risks [which] could impact an investors return on investment.  18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? A) As reflected in our response to question 10, the Coalition feels the definition of Information systems should only include those systems operationally controlled by the registrant. We recommend replacing used by with operated by within the proposed definition. If the registrant uses a third party system, they should not be required to report cybersecurity incidents that may occur on such systems. In the event a cybersecurity incident at a third party provider has a material impact on the registrant, the registrant should report the activity under Item 8.01.  21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? A) The Coalition recommends that a registrant should have to explicitly state if they have not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures. As the proposed rule 10 highlights, a cybersecurity incident could result in a material impact to a registrant. Consequently, investors have the right to know if a registrant has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures. 22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? A) The Coalition believes registrants should only be required to disclose at a high level whether [p]revious cybersecurity incidents informed changes in the registrants governance, policies and procedures, or technologies. Requiring the disclosure of specific details about how registrants are changing their programs in response to a cybersecurity incident could undermine the cybersecurity defenses of the registrant and make the registrant more vulnerable to cyberattacks. The Coalition does not believe that the disclosures required under Item 106 would necessarily undermine a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts as long as they are sensibly described. While there may be incremental risks associated with a registrants disclosures regarding their lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity, we feel the risk to the registrant is outweighed by the risk to a potential investor who is not able to assess a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures. In general, the Coalition believes that the disclosures specified in Item 106 regarding a registrants policies and procedures, if any, for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, a registrants cybersecurity governance, including the board of directors oversight role regarding cybersecurity risks, and managements role and relevant expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies would be beneficial in promoting transparency to investors on this increasingly important aspect of corporate governance. Additionally, this transparency should provide an incentive for the registrant to develop, implement, and maintain cybersecurity governance, policies, and procedures in line with industry best practices and standards. An approach to consider would be to initiate the Item 106 disclosures after the regulation is finalized to provide registrants time to implement their cybersecurity policies and procedures. The Coalition does, however, recommend that the SEC revise its proposed amendments to Item 106(d) to clarify that a registrant need only provide updates to previously disclosed material cybersecurity incidents, and need not make disclosures relating to immaterial incidents (unless they have become material in the aggregate, as proposed) that may have been addressed in the press or other third party reports.  11 23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? A) The Coalition does not believe the SEC should exempt any categories of registrants from proposed Item 106(b), including smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs. All organizations are potential targets of threat actors, who typically cast a wide net and are indiscriminate in their threat activities. Increased transparency with respect to companies cybersecurity risk management is valuable to investors when making investment decisions, regardless of filer type.  24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or asset backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? A) The Coalition does not think the SEC should significantly delay compliance with Item 106, but may instead provide for a period of transition for compliance. Cybersecurity risk assessment programs should be a foundational and strategic function of all organizations, no matter the age, size or industry. A decision to delay compliance would signal that cybersecurity risk assessment is only relevant to specific segments of companies, when the reality is that all organizations are potential targets by threat actors. It is to the benefit of companies, their customers, and their shareholders to ensure that adequate cybersecurity controls, and defenses are implemented without exception or the ability to delay compliance due to a technicality. The Coalition hopes that its input will be helpful to the SEC in highlighting the elements of the proposed rule that should be reconsidered or modified to better achieve the SECs stated goals, while becoming more consistent with cybersecurity standards and best practices, especially as they relate to incident reporting.

As discussed below, while AGA and INGAA appreciate the rationale behind the Commissions proposed rule, we believe that the current proposal should be modified to reflect longstanding concepts of materiality and to reduce the risk of inadvertently exposing issuers to cybersecurity threats. AGA and INGAA therefore respectfully request that the Commission revise the proposed amendments to incorporate and account for the comments below. AGA represents more than 200 energy companies that deliver clean natural gas throughout the United States. The majority of the AGAs members issue common stock that is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, and other U.S. securities exchanges. AGAs mission is to facilitate, on its members behalf, the promotion of safe, reliable, and efficient delivery of natural gas to homes and businesses across the nation. AGAs members include U.S. energy utilities, transmission and marketing companies, exploration and production companies, products and services companies, international energy companies and affiliates, and industry associates.  INGAA represents the U.S. natural gas pipeline industry. INGAAs members deliver clean, abundant, and affordable natural gas throughout North America and operate approximately 200,000 miles of pipelines that serve as an indispensable link between natural gas producers and consumers.  The Proposed Amendments Should Comport with Longstanding Concepts of Materiality As the Commission recognizes,1 it is well established that the materiality framework governs  1 See SEC Release Nos. 33 11038, 34 94382, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File No. S7 09 22 (Release) at 22 23.  Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 2 4889 0715 9325 disclosure under the securities laws.2 Although there are different articulations of the materiality standard, public companies are required to disclose information for which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision, or if it would have ‘significantly altered the total mix of information made available.3  Relatedly, the Commission, its staff, and the courts have recognized that the materiality assessment generally requires both a quantitative and qualitative analysis.4 On several occasions prior to the issuance of the current proposed rule, the Commission and its staff have applied the general materiality standard to assess disclosure obligations regarding threats to cybersecurity and digital infrastructure.5  The proposed rule should not alter this longstanding materiality framework, and we suggest that the Commissions final rule explicitly affirm the application of decades of materiality related precedent and guidance to cybersecurity risks and incidents. 6 We believe that the existing authoritative guidance provides an adequate framework for public companies that are victims of cyber incidents to evaluate their disclosure obligations to investors.7 That guidance instructs issuers to evaluate, for example, the impact of an incident on revenue and net income, whether the risk or incident affects the companys compliance with other regulatory or contractual  2 See, e.g., Exchange Act, Section 18(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78r(a) (Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document . . . which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable . . . .); Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 240 (1988) ([M]ateriality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.); TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1977) ([A]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding how to vote. . . . Put another way, there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix of information made available.). 3 Release at 23 (quoting TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 449). 4 SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 99. 5 See, e.g., SEC, Division of Corporate Finance, CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No. 2, Cybersecurity (Oct. 13, 2011) (in the context of increased use of digital technologies); cf.

Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 3 4889 0715 9325 requirements, and any other factor that may impact the total mix of information.8 In addition, the Commissions recent enforcement actions against issuers that failed to disclose material cybersecurity incidents make clear that the materiality of an incident depends in part on the nature of the registrants business.9 Collectively, the guidance issued by the Commission and Courts for over thirty years since the Supreme Court articulated the Basic v. Levinson standard provides companies with ample guidance to assess materiality of cybersecurity incidents. Any deviation from the existing longstanding framework would create confusion where none currently exists, and ultimately frustrate one of the Commissions primary objectives behind the proposed rulemaking—i.e., to ensure that investors receive information important enough to evaluate the risks of an investment.10 For those reasons, AGA and INGAA support the continued application of longstanding materiality principles to cybersecurity incidents and risks.  Requiring Disclosure of All Incidents that Lead to  Policy Changes Is Inconsistent with the Materiality Standard  The proposed rule would require registrants to disclose any cyber incidents that lead to changes in the companys policies and procedures, even where the underlying cyber incidents are entirely immaterial.11 We oppose this proposal, which would effectively mandate disclosure of numerous inconsequential cybersecurity incidents and thereby effectively override the longstanding materiality standard (discussed above) and potentially bury investors in an avalanche of trivial [and confusing] information. 12 Moreover, the proposed rule would actually disincentivize companies from proactively improving their cyber policies, procedures, systems, and controls by mandating disclosure of meaningless cyber incidents that could be linked—however remotely— to those improvements. We believe that in assessing the contours of any mandated cyber disclosures, including those that result in changes to policies and procedures, the Commission should continue to be guided by materiality. 8 SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 99. 9 See, e.g., In the Matter of Pearson, plc, A.P. File No. 3 220462, Sec. Exchange Act Release No. 92676 (Aug. 16, 2021) (finding PII related breach to be material because respondents business involved collection and storage of large quantities of private data.). 10 See Release at 55 (citing 15 USC § 77(b)(b); 15 USC § 78(c)(f)) (noting the statutory requirement that the Commission must consider whether proposed rulemaking is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.). 11 See Release at 38 (noting that Form 106(b) requires disclosure of cybersecurity related risks and incidents that have affected the registrants results of operations or financial condition and cybersecurity risks that are considered as part of the registrants business strategy); Release at 106 07 (same).  12 BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, supra note 6 at 6. Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 4 4889 0715 9325 Requiring Disclosure Regarding Managements Role in Implementing  Cybersecurity Policies Is Too Granular and Not Beneficial to Investors  The Commission should not adopt Item 106(c) as proposed.13 The details the Commission would potentially require with regard to the description of managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and in implementing the registrants cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies are far too granular to be useful to investors. With respect to cybersecurity matters, investors expect an overview that provides assurance that management and the board of directors are devoting appropriate attention to issues. Granular details regarding a registrants management expertise and oversight regarding the registrants policies, procedures, strategies, and incident responses are not beneficial to making investment decisions. This granular detail is also subject to frequent change including based on developments in technology and management practices. To account for those realities, we suggest the following modification to proposed Item 106(c)(2):  Describe whether registrant has a designated chief information security officer, or someone in a comparable position, and whether and how frequently such person reports to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors regarding cybersecurity risk.  This information should be sufficient for investors to make a determination regarding whether management and the board of directors are paying appropriate attention to cybersecurity issues. Additional information is not necessary for investors and puts the Commission in the position of regulating a registrants policies, procedures, and strategies instead of its disclosures.  In conformity with the suggested modification above to proposed Item 106(c)(2), and for the same reasons as stated above, the Commission should modify proposed Item 407(j)(1)14 to contain solely the same language as the suggested modification above to proposed Item 106(c)(2).  The Commission Should Not Require Companies to Make  Disclosures Prior to the Completion of Materiality Assessments The Commission seeks comments regarding whether there should be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident.15 Because this proposed requirement, if adopted, is likely to confuse investors, lead to duplicative—and potentially contradictory—disclosures, and frustrate the ability of victims of cybersecurity incidents to conduct appropriate investigations, AGA and INGAA believe that this proposal is inconsistent with the Exchange Act and the Commission should decline to adopt it.  13 See Release at 42.  14 See Release at 46.  15 See Release at 29. Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 5 4889 0715 9325 Importantly, a companys understanding regarding the facts and circumstances of a cyber incident may differ materially when an incident is initially discovered and when the company subsequently makes a materiality determination. If disclosure is required both upon discovery of the incident and again upon a materiality determination, companies will inevitably disclose numerous immaterial incidents. The Commission should allow companies to delay disclosure of cybersecurity incidents in the event of an ongoing internal investigation so long as the investigation is completed without undue delay. A specific timeframe for reporting that is unrelated to the completion of a materiality determination is arbitrary and capricious. By contrast, AGA and INGAAs proposed undue delay standard would permit companies to gather and analyze all facts necessary for making a materiality determination. Forcing a materiality determination while the company is taking these steps will undoubtedly pull important resources away from necessary response activities (which could ultimately harm investors). Importantly, disclosure prior to these steps and making this determination is also likely to lead to inaccurate materiality determinations, which will create information uncertainty and cause undue alarm to investors.  Additionally, where cybersecurity incidents are determined to be material, the two sets of disclosures that companies will be required to make may vary from each other in important respects. Accordingly, a proposed early disclosure requirement, which is inconsistent with the foundational principle of U.S. securities regulation that disclosure is premised upon materiality, will shift the burden to investors to sift through multiple sets of (unnecessary) disclosures. For those reasons, the Commission should not require issuers to make any disclosures prior to a materiality determination.16  The Commissions consideration of a requirement that companies disclose cyber incidents when they are initially discovered appears to be premised upon the belief that registrants may delay completing materiality determinations to avoid making timely disclosures.17 AGA and INGAA believe that this risk is low for two reasons. First, AGA and INGAA believe that existing operational, cybersecurity, and financial realities already incentivize companies to investigate expeditiously cyber incidents. Second, to the extent an issuer fails to timely evaluate whether a cybersecurity incident is material, the Commission already has tools in place to hold those companies accountable, including Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(a), which requires public companies to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information is disclosed to investors in a timely manner.18 Relatedly, the Commission also seeks comments regarding the timing and form of disclosures in the event that a company determines that a series of previously undisclosed individually  16 See Release at 30; Release at 127 (Instructions to Item 1.05).  17 See Release at 31.  18 See Rule 13a 15(a), (e); see also In the Matter of First Am. Fin. Corp., A.P. File No. 3 20367, Sec. Exchange Act Release No. 92176 (June 14, 2021) (enforcement action based on insufficient disclosure controls and procedures premised on respondents failure to evaluate timely whether to disclose cyber breach). Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 6 4889 0715 9325 immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate. 19  Under these circumstances, AGA and INGAA believe that the timeline for reporting should begin to run as of the materiality determination related to the final incident—i.e., when the company determines that the incidents in the aggregate constitute a material event. The Commission also proposes to require registrants to disclose details related to the individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents when they become material in the aggregate.20 But providing detailed disclosure of each immaterial incident would be inconsistent with the general materiality standard and could provide potential threat actors with information regarding a companys vulnerabilities (without any corresponding benefit to investors). Issuers should therefore only be required to disclose information regarding these immaterial incidents to the extent that such information is necessary for investors to be fully informed regarding the aggregate material impact. For those reasons, AGA and INGAA support the Commissions position that the proposed four day disclosure window, if implemented, should not be triggered until the date that a registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident—or combination of incidents—is material.21 Disclosure should not be based upon the registrants mere discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity event prior to an assessment of materiality. 22 Finally, when a combination of individually immaterial incidents becomes material in the aggregate, disclosures regarding those individual incidents should be required only as they relate to the aggregate material impact.  Increasing the Level of Required Detail in Disclosures  Could Expose Companies to Additional Cyber Threats  The Commission has requested comments regarding whether the substance or timing of the proposed disclosures may have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents. 23 AGA and INGAA believe that this is a meaningful risk and suggest that the Commission amend certain proposed requirements to mitigate its potential impact.  In particular, AGA and INGAA suggest that proposed Items 1.05, 106(b), and 106(c)(2) should be modified to provide that the required disclosures may be high level in nature and that registrants may consider, in determining the appropriate level of detail, whether providing certain information may constitute an independent security risk. For example, proposed Item 1.05(5) would require the registrant to disclose whether it has remediated or is currently remediating a cybersecurity incident. If a registrant is currently remediating an incident, the incident may be ongoing and disclosure of that fact may encourage additional malicious acts. Indeed, the Commission acknowledges that, under certain circumstances, timely disclosure exposes registrants  19 See Release at 31.  20 Release at 33 34. 21 See Release at 22.  22 AGA also notes that the process of investigating a cybersecurity incident and applying the available materiality guidance to the facts and circumstances may be time consuming, and often requires coordination with counsel, auditors and accountants, and cybersecurity consultants. Any rulemaking that impacts the timing of required disclosures should be mindful of that reality. 23 See Release at 29; 43.  Vanessa Countryman, Secretary May 9, 2022 Pg. 7 4889 0715 9325 vulnerabilities to malicious actors who could even exacerbate an ongoing attack using the disclosed information.24 The risk associated with disclosure of excessive details may also create a chilling effect on registrants willingness to disclose cybersecurity incidents. For those reasons, AGA and INGAA suggest that proposed Items 1.05, 106(b), and 106(c)(2) be modified to provide that the required disclosures may be high level in nature and that registrants may consider the cybersecurity risk associated with disclosing additional details in determining whether they are required to do so. AGA and INGAA note that this proposed modification is consistent with the disclosure regimes of many states, which generally require public companies to disclose these items at a high level. Additionally, AGA and INGAA suggest that registrants be permitted to delay disclosure as necessary to determine the scope of an incident and restore the reasonable integrity of any compromised systems.  The Commission Should Not Require Disclosure of Information  that Could Undermine Ongoing Law Enforcement Investigations  The Commission has requested comments regarding whether registrants should be allowed to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay … in the interest of national security.25 AGA and INGAA agree with this proposal and suggest that the Commission expand the circumstances under which companies may delay reporting to include any cybersecurity incident for which a law enforcement agency concludes that disclosure would undermine an ongoing criminal or civil investigation. Allowing issuers to delay reporting— particularly in response to specific requests from law enforcement—may facilitate investigations aimed at apprehending threat actors, which may, in turn, prevent further cybersecurity incidents (thereby protecting investors).   *** AGA and INGAA appreciate the Commissions overall objective behind the proposed rulemaking.  Pursuant to longstanding principles of securities regulation in the United States, public companies should be required to disclose material cyber incidents and risks to investors. The comments in this correspondence are designed to bring the Commissions proposal into alignment with that bedrock principle and prevent companies from being forced to disclose information that could lead to additional cybersecurity incidents and ultimately frustrate the Commissions investor protection mandate.26 We thank the Commission for considering our perspective on these important issues.  24 Release at 75. 25 Release at 30.  26 About the SEC, What we do, available at https://www.sec.gov/Articule/whatwedohtml (explaining the Commissions three part mandate).

Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary  Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  File No.: S7 09 22  To Whom It May Concern:  I write on behalf of the Insurance Coalition, a group of life and property and casualty insurance companies that share a common interest in federal regulations. In this case, we write in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure proposed rule for publicly held companies (File No.: S7 09 22). Some Coalition members are publicly traded companies and will be directly affected by this specific proposed rule, and several others will be subject to the Commissions proposed breach notification requirements for investment advisors and the recently enacted Cyber Incident Reporting law included in the FY 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, as well as the various state level cybersecurity and breach reporting rules. It is our view that timely and proper cyber incident reporting will help improve our nations security and are essential elements of our duties of care and good faith to shareholders and/or investors. In that regard, however, we are conscious of the importance of breach notification to various regulatory agencies at both the state and federal levels, and the potential impact compliance with overlapping regulations can have on our ability to best serve our policyholders. We welcome this opportunity to comment and look forward to an ongoing dialogue to ensure robust and responsible cyber breach disclosure regulations that appropriately consider the insurance industrys unique regulatory framework. I. Vertical Regulatory Harmonization Under certain narrow circumstances, insurance companies are subject to specific federal regulations: publicly traded insurers, and in their capacity as investment advisors, are subject to certain SEC regulations; under the Dodd Frank Act, Insurance Savings and Loan Holding Companies are subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve.1 However, per the McCarran Ferguson Act (McCarran Ferguson), enacted in 1945, the business of insurance is regulated by the states.2 1 31 USC § 313. 2 15 USC § 1011.  mindsetdc.com McCarran Ferguson sets up a reverse preemption regime in which state laws regulating the business of insurance are not preempted unless Congress explicitly states its intention to do so in federal legislation. State regulation of insurance includes solvency regulation and consumer protection regulation. This includes regulating policies, rates, and the conduct of insurance companies in the market through continuous market conduct examinations. Cyber incident reporting, therefore, falls squarely within the jurisdiction of state insurance commissions. An important issue will be to ensure harmonized regulation between the federal government and the several states with proposed or preexisting cybersecurity regulations. An important means of minimizing compliance costs that do not translate into improved cybersecurity standards or shareholder/investor transparency would be to create safe harbor provisions in terms of notice content. Requiring disclosure on an 8K, or a 10Q or 10K as appropriate, is necessary to put shareholders and investors on notice. However, an overly prescriptive regulation outlining the specific form or contents of the filing will cause insurers to unnecessarily spend time complying with nuanced specifics of various regulatory filings at the state and federal level with no further benefit to our nations security, shareholders, or investors. II. Horizontal Regulatory Harmonization In addition to compliance with state cyber breach notification requirements, many insurers are, or will be, subject to several other federal cybersecurity regulations: a joint rule among prudential banking regulators pertaining to computer security incident reporting,3 the Commissions proposed cyber breach reporting rule for registered investment advisors,4 and potentially the forthcoming cyber incident reporting rule for critical infrastructure industries to be promulgated by the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).5 While this proposed rule requires entities to report a material breach within four business days, the banking agency computer security incident reporting rule requires notif[ication].as soon as possible when the bank service provider determines that it has experienced a computer security incident,6 the RIA rule would require notification within 48 hours,7 and CISAs forthcoming rule, per statute, will require notification within 72 hours.8 Again, each regulation serves an important policy goal. And alerting necessary stakeholders in a timely manner is essential. However, compliance with various—and perhaps at times duplicative or conflicting—requirements in each regulation in such a short amount of time can distract from immediate goals of ensuring the firms network. Instead, the compliance regime should prioritize substance over form, allow for flexibility through safe harbors or reference to  3 12 CFR §53, 225, and 304.  4 17 CFR §§ 230, 232, 239, 270, 374, 275, and 279.  5 Division Y, H.R. 2471, 117th Congress (2021 2022): Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.  6 See supra, note 3.  7 See supra, note 4.  8 See supra, note 5. mindsetdc.com  other regulatory filings, and strike the right balance of providing necessary disclosures to all relevant stakeholders without distracting from the immediate goals to protect the entitys network. III. Scope of Compliance Another crucial means of maximizing regulatory flexibility without compromising safety and transparency is ensuring uniform definitions of key terms, as well as establishing clear guidelines for compliance. Definition of Relevant Cybersecurity Terms In addition to allowing for a prudent level of flexibility via safe harbors or harmonization with parallel state and federal regulatory filings, it is imperative that definitions of key terms are also harmonized. Having a clear and uniform understanding of what constitutes cybersecurity, a cyber incident, and what is a cybersecurity expert, will ensure necessary regulatory clarity.  Coordination with other federal agencies to ensure a uniform set of key term definitions will be critical. An easy solution is to adopt definitions from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.9 Doing so will not only ensure swift compliance following a cyber incident, but also provide a necessary level of clarity to allow for integration of incident reporting into long term cyber hygiene strategic planning. Definition of Materiality The proposed rule requires firms to report material cyber incidents, relying on a case law definition of materiality as information that a reasonable shareholder would consider…important.10 Furthermore, the rule applies a retrospective definition of material by requiring subsequent reporting of an incident if, over time, an incident or incidents become material in the aggregate.11 On the one hand, applying a materiality definition from securities case law—including a post hoc assessment of the aggregate impact of incident(s)—is logical as it seeks to harmonize the Commissions breach notification requirements with other rules and regulations from the SEC. However, the unique, sensitive, and evolving nature of cybersecurity issues does not lend itself to traditional application of securities case law. Disclosing cyber breaches to the government is a necessary means of ensuring the resilience of our nations economy, and transparency of our markets. If not properly tailored, however, such disclosures can unintentionally overshare a firms vulnerabilities if an overly conservative  9 Computer Security Resource Center, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, available at: https://csrc.nist.gov.  10 TSC Indus. v. Northway, 426 U.S. at 449.  11 Proposed Item 106(d) of Regulation S K.  mindsetdc.com  definition of material is adopted by the company—thereby exposing the firm to greater risk of cyberattack to the future detriment of shareholders and investors. Conversely, a narrow view of materiality, even if reasonable, could expose an entity to unnecessary regulatory or litigation risk. Relying on a reasonableness definition of materiality under securities case law in turn requires firms to not only constantly monitor and assess changes in case law definitions, but also to the evolving consequences of a prior cyber incident. This overemphasizes compliance with a regulation, with no direct tangible added benefit to shareholders, to the detriment of allowing for the necessary resources to improve a firms cyber posture. Cybersecurity risk is an evolving and ever changing threat. Aligning definitions with other securities laws necessarily creates an untenable dynamic where traditional static processes are applied to a fast paced policy concern. Doing this puts too great of a burden on covered entities and can lead to both over and under reporting. This in turn provides inadequate information to the Commission and shareholders, while also exposing firms to unnecessary risks. Instead, clear cut, standardized, definitions of materiality are needed for ultimate regulatory clarity. And, as discussed above, these definitions can and should be harmonized with other federal and state regulations, and/or a safe harbor allowance for adopting definitions from parallel regulations to which publicly traded firms are subject. Scope of Coverage Another issue of particular concern to insurers is ensuring reporting by a parent corporation covers compliance of individual agents, brokers, or other subsidiary entities. A model for this is New Yorks Department of Financial Services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies. Per 23 CRR NY 500.19(b): An employee, agent, representative or designee of a covered entity, who is itself a covered entity, is exempt from the Part and need not develop its own cybersecurity program to the extent that the employee, agent, representative or designee is covered by the cybersecurity program of the covered entity.12 Given the nature of the business of insurance, publicly traded insurers will be subject to both the registered investment advisor cyber breach notification rule, as well as the rule pertaining to publicly traded companies. In other words, a cyber breach of one insurance agency, if owned by a publicly traded parent, necessarily triggers compliance with both regulations. Funneling all filings through a corporate parent will provide organizations with necessary clarity and compliance ease, without detriment to shareholder and investor transparency. IV. Cybersecurity Expertise for Board of Directors  Under the proposed rule, public companies would be required to disclose the cybersecurity expertise of members of their Board of Directors. The Commissions proposed rule for investment advisors contains a similar provision. Under the proposed measures, such details  12 23 CRR NY 500.19(b). mindsetdc.com  would be made available in proxy or informational statements pertaining to the election of Directors. In addition to unclear definitions of expertise and the associated compliance costs discussed above, disclosure of cybersecurity expertise without a mandate for cyber experts to serve on a Board, will necessarily signal potential vulnerabilities to cyber criminals—thereby exposing firms to even greater cyber risk. Having cyber expertise on a public firm Board of Directors is a reasonable means of ensuring good corporate governance. Pursuing this through public, and not private, policy however necessarily creates a Catch 22. Requiring disclosure of cyber expertise on a Board of Directors without a mandate unnecessarily exposes vulnerabilities of firms without cyber expertise, or with limited expertise. This in turn makes reporting a de facto mandate for cyber experts to serve on a board for reasonable firms. Mandating cyber experts to serve on public company boards, however, is a potential overreach of the Commission as it denies firms the ability to compete on cybersecurity as a means of protecting shareholders, customers, and investors and ultimately, innovation in both cybersecurity hygiene and corporate governance. V. Conclusions The goal of the Commissions proposed rule is laudable, and a necessary complement to other state and federal cyber breach notification regulations to ensure material cyber incidents are properly reflected in share prices of publicly traded firms. However, these goals could be stymied by an overly rigid compliance regime that does not allow for harmonization with existing and forthcoming state and federal regulations. As such, we urge the Commission to adopt a substance over form philosophy to breach disclosures and allow for flexibility and harmonization with other filing requirements. Furthermore, to ensure clarity and swift compliance with reporting following a cyber breach and allow for incident reporting to be integrated into long term firm cybersecurity strategy, clear, uniform, definitions of key terms and scope of coverage is imperative. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.  Sincerely,   Zach Ostro Senior Director, Cybersecurity Working Group The Insurance Coalition",2

Countryman Secretary Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 RE: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File Number  S7 09 22)  Submitted via rule comment@sec.gov  Dear Ms. Countryman:  The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) welcomes the opportunity to provide comments to the Security and Exchange Commissions (Commission) proposed rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. NEMA represents nearly 325 electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers that make safe, reliable, and efficient products and systems. Many of our member companies are considered part of critical infrastructure by the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), specifically within the critical manufacturing sector, meaning their operations are crucial to the economic prosperity and continuity of the United States.1 Due to this important classification, NEMA has worked tirelessly for years encouraging all electroindustry companies, both publicly and privately owned, to make cybersecurity a key pillar of their organizational structure. Electrical manufacturers believe that cybersecurity is a team sport; that the government and private sector share a dual responsibility to create a collaborative environment through the development of good policies and practices. Each part relies on the other for accurate, timely, and meaningful advice and support; a mutual trust that is built through practical and reasonable information sharing and disclosure between dedicated and responsible authorities, executives, and decision makers. NEMA supports disclosure requirements that build upon and reinforce this principle of trust; however, the required dissemination of information to public audiences based upon a materiality standard, as the Commission proposes, is counterproductive. Such a standard does not include or expect any understanding of cybersecurity and would erode the bonds of this public private partnership.  NEMAs comments will emphasize two aspects of cybersecurity which will also address many of the specific questions asked in the proposed rule: the need to understand cybersecurity model distinctions and the necessity of a significant reporting standard. As will be discussed below, most manufacturers rely on distinct and complex cybersecurity frameworks uniquely developed to safeguard operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS). Additionally, NEMA believes that because these cybersecurity models are distinct, cyber incidents should not be measured by a broad subjective standard. Further, only incidents that can be defined as significant, or having meaningful consequence which may cause real harm to operations and human safety, should be disclosed.  . 2  Cybersecurity Model Distinctions  Many electrical manufacturers operate highly sophisticated ICS which allow for production efficiency. ICS are generally comprised of integrated and proprietary OT to monitor and manage manufacturing equipment. OT differs from information technologies (IT) that generally comprise the information technology aspects of an organization that interact with consumers and human end users. ICS include supervisory control and data acquisition systems, distributed control systems, and programmable logic controllers. ICS allow manufacturers and other system operators to achieve high level output goals which make them critical to American security and continuity, as well as a savory target for malicious cyber actors. An April 2022 joint cybersecurity advisory issued by the Department of Energy, CISA, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) emphasize the constant and elevated risk ICS operators face2.  Cybersecurity is not a tangible or specific thing; rather, it is a comprehensive strategy to secure systems based on their composition and intended function. (The Commissions proposed rule does not define cybersecurity.) IT systems and OT/ICS serve vastly different functions and, therefore, have different security requirements. Further, while a product may be produced to a certain manufacturing cybersecurity standard, how that product is applied and configured by an end user could be held to a different standard. For example, NEMA has published its own set of cybersecurity best practices specific to electrical manufacturers and for the end users of their products. These include:  • Cyber Hygiene Best Practices for Manufacturers (NEMA CPSP 2 2018) Industry best practices and guidelines to improve cybersecurity sophistication in manufacturing facilities and engineering processes.  • Cyber Hygiene Best Practices for End Users (NEMA CPSP 3 2019) Industry best practices and guidelines for electrical and medical imaging manufacturers customers to raise their level of cybersecurity sophistication as they utilize connected equipment.  The security standards that work for one entity, industry, or end user may not work for or apply to another. It is also necessary to consider that resources are finite; the strategies developed by companies to secure their systems are influenced by multiple variables such as funding/budget, access to knowledgeable human capital and expertise, and technical equipment availability. Effective security strategies need to be aligned with postures which have been developed to protect their intended function. These postures cannot be subjective; they must be constructed using internationally recognized and understood frameworks that appropriately capture the scope of IT and OT/ICS applications. They also must be verifiable; OT/ICS conformity assessments are necessary for a system to protect against known threats and vulnerabilities. Numerous universally recognized frameworks for these operational systems currently exist, including (but not limited to):  • NIST Cybersecurity Framework • IEC 62443  • NIST 800 53 • NIST 800 82 • ISO 27000 Series Cybersecurity is complex and is rooted in objectivity, as the OT/ICS frameworks listed above demonstrate. However, the proposed rule seeks to establish a materiality standard as the trigger for  3  mandatory cyber incident reporting. Per the Commissions definition, materiality means that there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important.3 While a reasonable shareholder might find that cybersecurity is important, it is impractical to assume that they would understand the intricacies related to a cyber incident, including the nuances and subtle differences between IT and OT/ICS frameworks or operations. Without understanding the details of a registrants cybersecurity postures, investors may not be able to accurately comprehend the impacts of various cyber incidents. Use of a materiality standard to require registrants to disclose sophisticated information and details about every cyber incident could risk oversimplifying the incident itself by trivializing the information reported to the Commission. Information which is incomplete and without context or background does not help an investor make the best decision. NEMA reiterates that it supports disclosure requirements that build upon and reinforce trust, fosters mutual cooperation between industry and government, and furthers cybersecurity postures. As the proposed rule is currently written, we urge that the Commission not rush to implement a mandatory reporting criteria wholesale without first taking into account the potential security risks and negative financial impacts of publicizing information regarding an ongoing cyber incident. Significant Reporting Standard  In March 2022, Congress passed the bipartisan Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA). The legislation identifies malicious actions that rise to a degree warranting attention by CISA as a ‘significant cyber incident. Per the legislative bill text, a ‘significant incident means:  a cyber incident, or group of related cyber incidents, that the Secretary (of Homeland Security) determines is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the people of the United States.4 CISAs use of ‘significant as a triggering standard, rather than materiality, focuses on attacks that cause real harm. Further, CIRCIA authorizes the agency to determine what covered cyber incidents will need to be disclosed to the agency under that standard. Congress established a significant standard for cyber incident reporting to boost information sharing, partnership trust, and proper investigative analysis through an objective filter. Materiality is overly subjective and is not a practical approach to increasing a companys cybersecurity posture. The proposed rules use of a materiality standard breaks from Congressional intent and prioritizes investors presumed interest above the cybersecurity of a registrant. During a cyber incident, this standard would force a company to focus on determining what information is deemed material to report rather than securing their systems. Proper disclosure should focus on first mitigating the cause of the incident, work with law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident, and then determine who is impacted. Following an objective based process, rather than quickly pushing information out to the public, does put investor interest first by helping ensure their investment is secure and its value protected.  If the Commission is committed to improving cybersecurity postures, practices, and governance among registrants, we recommend that it not promote a policy standard that would have the opposite effect of making a company secure. NEMA strongly encourages the Commission to harmonize its triggering definition for disclosure with the CIRCIA standard of ‘significant, or develop an objective metric that can help registrants categorize what information is to be reported. 4  Cyber incident reporting based on an objective triggering threshold recognizes a key element: not all cyber incidents across economic sectors are momentous enough to warrant disclosure. For example, a cyber incident that is caused by employee error should not be viewed through the same focus as a company under assault from a malicious cyber group being funded by a hostile nation state actor. The motivations behind a cyber incident also need to be fully understood; attacks against critical manufacturing registrants may occur to simply probe their cybersecurity posture, or to cause financial harm via ransomware extortion, or to cause physical harm by damaging OT/ICS.  Further, due to the strategic importance of registrants which are a part of critical infrastructure, it is expected that malicious cyber attacks against them do and will continue to occur. However, not all of those incidents will rise to a level that warrant agency consideration or action, unless required by existing state or federal law. The distinction between cyber incidents prevents reporting authorities from being flooded with disclosures about incidents with little or no security value. A deluge of cyber incident reports could undermine the proposed rules intention of security through investor awareness by creating the false impression among shareholders that a registrants cybersecurity posture is weak or ineffective. Continuous reporting using the same standard could create fatigue among investors, and the intended result of this proposed rule becomes further jaded. This could result in investors not responding appropriately to consequential cyber incidents because they have become indistinguishable from others. NEMA firmly believes the public disclosure of a registrants specific cybersecurity attestation models should not be made public. Revealing which frameworks and third parties constitute a registrants security posture runs the high risk of violating contractual agreements and opens those third parties to liability risk and financial harm. It would allow competitors and malicious actors to ascertain details about a registrants intellectual property through deduction, reverse engineering, and other methods. Unless investors have a direct role in the administrative functions and operations to a registrants cybersecurity posture, there is no material value to be gained from having such information disclosed.  Additional Comments  Reporting Timeline & Confidentiality The proposed rule states that a material cyber incident must be disclosed within four business days. NEMA supports disclosure timelines that allow for the most accurate intelligence regarding an incident to be gathered in order to present the best information to the required authorities. The Commissions proposed use of ‘business days to report an incident undermines the importance of cyber threats and contradicts the intent of its proposed rule. The purpose of prompt incident reporting to CISA, the FBI, and other agencies is to address and remedy a cyber threat as soon as possible. To this end, these authorities have established specific reporting timeline language, i.e. the exact number of hours an entity has to submit a report. According to the Department of the Treasurys definition, a ‘business day does not include Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or any other day the SEC is obligated by law to be closed5. By using ‘business day as the reporting baseline, the sense of urgency is greatly diluted and gives the perception that cyber incidents are merely another element of business that can be handled during normal business/trading hours. If ensuring and bolstering a registrants cybersecurity posture is an end goal of this proposed rule, NEMA urges the Commission to reflect this motivation by adopting a specific reporting timeline. NEMA recommends that no reporting requirement should be less than 72 hours, so as to remain harmonious with other federal laws and reporting practices.  5  Additionally, and most importantly, any required disclosure should be protected and handled in a confidential and appropriate manner until an investigation has concluded. It is necessary to highlight that most cyber incidents are criminal in nature, intentionally carried out to disrupt and cause harm. As such, targeted registrants of cyberattacks are victims of crimes and should be offered due process. In practice, releasing information about a criminal action based solely on a materiality standard would punish the victim of an attack and could undermine an investigation. Publicly released information should be aggregated as much as possible to protect the reputation and market capitalization of a registrant.  NEMA recognizes and commends the Commissions attempt to see more registrants enhance their cybersecurity postures and make investors more aware of the importance of cybersecurity. However, for reasons stated above, the policy of public disclosure of sensitive cyber incident information through a materiality standard would undermine a registrants cybersecurity. As mentioned in our opening, cybersecurity is a team sport and NEMA stands ready to be a willing partner on behalf of electroindustry registrants. We hope the Commission takes its time to develop refined reporting criteria that better enhances cybersecurity postures.

The financial sector has had cybersecurity reporting and risk management requirements in law and regulation for more than twenty years and is a firm believer in sharing cyber threat information to protect not only individual institutions, their customers, and shareholders, but the entire U.S. economy. Based on this work, we encourage the SEC to consider the following critical items to better achieve the goal of protecting investors.  Ongoing cybersecurity incidents should not be publicly disclosed.  The proposed rules would require firms to publicly disclose a cyber incident within 4 business days, including information such as whether the incident is ongoing or has been remediated. Financial institutions regularly share cyber incident information with government partners such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and each other through the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS ISAC). These sharing mechanisms provide valuable information to help other firms protect themselves, support law enforcements ability to hold bad actors accountable, and identify and combat national security threats. These sharing mechanisms, however, include important protections against public disclosure which is critical to fostering the kind of dialogue and collaboration between the federal government and private critical infrastructure that will be necessary to effectively protect against growing cyber threats and for providing the necessary window to investigate and remediate incidents. Public disclosure while an incident is ongoing could create unintended consequences that would further harm investors and compound the negative effects of an incident. Providing too little detail or inaccurate data in an 8 K filing could raise unnecessary concern or confusion in the markets and bring questions from investors and the media, while disclosing details of the incident—even if limited— and remediation steps could provide attackers useful information to at worst expand an attack, or at a minimum hide their tracks and destroy evidence needed for forensic purposes. It could also signal to other malicious actors that the firm is distracted by an ongoing incident, potentially making it vulnerable to additional attacks.  2 Cyber actors have become increasingly sophisticated and operate like a well funded corporation offering various attack tools (e.g., malicious code), information (stolen access credentials, network architecture designs), and even customer support services to other criminals. Recent cyber attack trends have demonstrated that criminals will infiltrate a firm, investigate its networks, plant malicious code, and then wait for months prior to launching an attack. Attacks may then be timed for maximum effect, such as during a merger or acquisition when a firm may be more likely to pay a ransom. Public disclosure of an incident could signal to these attackers that it may be a good time for them to strike as well, risking further harm to the company, its shareholders, and customers. For financial institutions, particularly banks, public disclosure of an ongoing incident could cause unnecessary panic among customers leading to a run on a bank—something banks and their prudential regulators work diligently to mitigate and avoid. The recent experiences of the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline illustrate the unintended and cascading effects of public disclosure. Following the shutdown of the pipeline, early analysis indicated there would be sufficient gas supply to meet near term demand; however, upon hearing the news, individuals immediately went to the pump to fill up their tanks causing further panic and shortages along much of the East Coast.  Another important aspect to consider is the effect public disclosure of an ongoing incident may have on critical infrastructure companies or companies providing critical services to a wide swath of customers. Should a large technology provider suffer an incident that affects only a small portion of its customers, it could be quickly overrun with demands for information from all its customers, creating what may be unnecessary concern and confusion and diverting resources away from response and remediation. Its not hard to imagine such a scenario driving market activity as well, based on initial information that may later turn out to be less significant following a full investigation.  For these reasons we strongly suggest the rule be modified to allow for disclosure after the firm determines the incident is no longer ongoing.  Public disclosure rules should allow exemptions for active law enforcement investigations, national security, or critical infrastructure protection purposes.  The proposed rule noticeably excludes consideration of reporting delays due to an ongoing law enforcement or national security related investigation, which could harm the nations ability to hold criminals and other bad actors accountable. The federal government, including leaders at the White House, Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, and CISA, among others, have strongly encouraged companies to report cyber incidents so that they can better analyze tactics and techniques, prosecute crimes, and help defend against national security and criminal threats. The lack of an exemption for law enforcement purposes is inconsistent with other cyber notification requirements and conflicts with many state breach notification laws that permit a delay. It would put firms in the difficult position of deconflicting SEC requirements with state laws and guidance from DOJ.  In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the potential for retaliatory cyber attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure, CISA has launched its Shields Up1 initiative and encouraged firms to lower their thresholds for sharing suspicious cyber activity with CISA or the FBI in order to better assess the threat environment and provide early warning of attacks. This approach, which is confidential and maintains  1 https://www.cisa.gov/shields up  3  the anonymity of those reporting information, helps build trust and forms a key element of our national cybersecurity strategy. In some instances, the FBI has asked companies suffering a cyber attack to allow the attack to continue so they may collect valuable information such as IP addresses, types of information accessed or stolen, or other tactics, techniques, and procedures. This information is used not only to help other victim companies but is also necessary to hold the perpetrators accountable. The proposed SEC rules mechanism for gaining an exemption to public disclosure of an incident at the request of the Attorney General would apply only in rare circumstances and could have a debilitating effect on law enforcement investigations. It would also add one more thing to do during an incident that would pull valuable resources away from investigation and remediation at the worst possible time. As discussed above, we strongly recommend that the rule be amended to allow for public disclosure after the firm remediates the event to avoid interfering with important investigatory and response work. At a minimum, a broader exemption for law enforcement, national security, or other critical infrastructure protection purposes should be included and we encourage the SEC to collaborate with CISA and the FBI on an appropriate mechanism for balancing the importance of public disclosure with the critical needs of cyber protection and response.  New disclosure requirements should be harmonized and aligned with existing requirements and take into consideration the operational impact on cybersecurity teams.  For already regulated critical infrastructure sectors, it is vital to ensure new reporting requirements are harmonized with existing laws and regulations. Financial institutions comply with a multitude of reporting requirements which lay out key definitions, timelines, and reporting thresholds, as well as oversight and enforcement mechanisms which may include fines and other penalties. In the early stages of an incident response, the extent of an intrusion may be unclear and cybersecurity teams must focus on protecting the firm and its customers and restoring services as safely and quickly as possible. In recognition of this critical time period, the prudential financial regulators—the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation— recently issued cyber incident notification rules and guidance2 that carefully balance the regulators need for early notice of a significant cyber event with a financial institutions need to focus on responding and safely restoring or maintaining services.  Similarly, this past March, Congress passed the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act3, which emphasizes the need for harmonization and alignment of reporting requirements across the federal government and establishes an interagency Incident Reporting Council to review requirements more holistically. Under this new law, firms suffering a cyber incident will be required to report details of an attack to CISA within 72 hours and a ransomware payment within 24 hours. The financial sector recognizes the value of reporting to CISA, which will help all 16 critical infrastructure sectors better protect themselves and give the government information it needs to help protect national security, public health and safety, and the functioning of our economy. The growing set of incident  2 https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/23/2021 25510/computer security incident notification requirements for banking organizations and their bank  3 https://legiscan.com/US/text/HB2471/2021 (Division Y) 4  notification, reporting, and disclosure requirements, however, must be looked at in the aggregate and consideration should be given to the operational impact on a firm suffering an attack. For financial institutions, the timeline begins with required notification to prudential regulators within 36 hours, followed by reporting to CISA within 72 hours, in addition to other state and international requirements. While these reports are kept confidential and protected from disclosure, the SECs proposed rule would add public reporting within four business days, placing further strain on an institution as its first responders work round the clock with the firms legal and compliance teams to ensure each agencys nuanced reporting requirements are met and fielding media and other requests for information. Each of these forms of reporting  notification, detailed reporting, and public disclosure—have an important purpose, but the benefits and operational impacts of each must be carefully considered. Firms would benefit from more uniform reporting procedures, particularly in the early stages of an incident, that allow cyber teams to focus on protection and minimizing impact. On behalf of the FSSCC, thank you for your consideration of these recommendations and for your leadership on cybersecurity matters. We stand ready to work with you to improve public disclosure while protecting critical infrastructure and our national security and advancing public private partnerships to strengthen our cyber preparedness and resilience.

May 9, 2022 Re: File Number S7 09 22, Comments on the SECs Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Dear Sir/Madam: This is a comment letter on the SECs cyber disclosures submitted jointly by me, Shiva Rajgopal, and my co author, Alex Sharpe. I chair both the Cybersecurity and Board Director programs for Columbia Business School, entitled Leading Cybersecurity at Your Organization (https://bit.ly/3P17noJ) and Corporate Governance Program: Developing Exceptional Board Leaders (https://bit.ly/3FBe24I) respectively. Alex Sharpe (https://bit.ly/3jGvJED) is a long time cybersecurity and business strategy professional with real world operational experience. He has over 30 years of experience working these areas nationally and internationally for both the public and private sectors including the U.S. Intelligence Community and regulators.  To frame our comments, it is useful to summarize what the new SEC rule asks for:  • The rule requires current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 Ks within four business days; • The rule requires periodic disclosures regarding, among other things: o A firms policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; o Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures; o Board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and its oversight of cybersecurity risk; and • The rule asks for updates about previously reported material cybersecurity incidents.  We support the new requirements in principle. However, we believe these requirements do not go far enough in certain areas and can be refined in others. We also believe that the rules need to be expanded to address all three of the Commissions roles. As written, the proposed changes are highly focused on near term aspects of protecting investors (the first role): (i) protect investors; (ii) maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and (iii) facilitate capital formation.  Our letter is organized in two parts. The first part provides data points to support the SECs proposed rules. The second part lays out where the SEC could go farther with respect to the disclosure requirements.  1.0 In defense of the proposed rules  1.1 Defending the four day disclosure requirement  Marriott waited 11 weeks to reveal that 383 million customer records had been compromised, exposing at least 25 million passport numbers and 8 million payment cards. Can you imagine Marriott waiting for 11 weeks to disclose its quarterly earnings numbers? That would not be acceptable. So, why is waiting that long to disclose a cyber incident acceptable?1  The data breach was noticed on September 8, 2018. Marriott filed the 10 Q covering the period ending September 30, 2018 on November 6, 2018. Although Marriott devoted two full paragraphs to the threat of cyberattacks in this filing, there is no mention of the massive data breach nor any disclosure of any economic impact to the company. Marriott then filed a form 8 K on November 30, 2018, disclosing the cyber attack. A form 8 K is supposed to be filed within three days of the relevant material corporate event and for other types of news the company is capable of acting quickly. For example, when Senator Mitt Romney resigned from the board of Marriott on November 8, 2018, a Form 8 K was filed on November 9, 2018. We restricted our review of the disclosures before the attack happened. Marriotts cyber disclosures mechanically improved after the attack but the whole point of disclosure regulation is to assist the investor with ex ante assessment of the risk and return implications of cyber threat exposure.  1.2 Cyber hacks increasingly move stock prices but news is incomplete and reaches the market late  In the early days, stock prices barely reacted to a cyber hack, partly because losses were socialized among consumers, credit card companies and banks.2 However, systematic evidence is beginning to build suggesting that stock prices move in response to news of cyber hacks, especially as more recent attacks involve ransomware. Kamiya et al (2021) find a statistically significant negative stock price reaction. In aggregate, they find that for a subset of 75 first time attacks with negative abnormal stock returns, the total shareholder wealth loss is $104 billion.3 We hasten to point out that the Kamiya et al (2021) study can only track publicly revealed news of cyber attacks. We can confidently conjecture that several cyber hacks on public firms were not revealed to the stock market. On top of that, we conjecture that the market found about these attacks many days or weeks after the breach actually occurred. Surely, the investor deserves to know in a timely manner after a cyber hack whether an attack occurred and the extent of the damage caused. Missing or incomplete disclosures about the actual loss associated with IP (intellectual property) theft, the investment of the firm in IT (information technology) structure, dollar value of business  1 Rajgopal and Gezer, Harvard Business Review, March 5, 2019. Available at https://hbr.org/2019/03/the marriott breach shows just how inadequate cyber risk disclosures are  2 Rajgopal and Srinivasan, Wall Street Journal, October 3, 2016.

(2021), Journal of Financial Economics, March 2021, 139(3): 719 749.  interruption, and continuity planning, listed in 2.2 to 2.5 below, lead us to conclude that the stock price reactions documented in Kamiya et al (2021) are likely under stated and incomplete. The point being, stock markets and investors, are relatively in the dark, both in terms of the timing of the cyber attack and information about how to model the likely loss a public firm will suffer. The SECs new rules would go a long way in making stock markets more efficient by addressing this gaping information asymmetry problem between the firms management and its investors.  2.0 New requirements advocating going further  We now turn to gaps that the SECs rules do not explicitly cover:  2.1 Expanded report aligned with all three roles of the SEC  The four day period is a good step forward but we suggest that this rule be enhanced to better align with the SECs stated objectives. We propose a less formal notice within four days with a more formal response to follow in not less than ten days and in no more than thirty days. This revised procedure will lead to a report that other firms can use to bolster their own defenses and allow the organization to address the incident at hand.  We also propose Law Enforcement and possibly other bodies such as Homeland Security be consulted before any public disclosures are made. Such a procedure would avoid compromising other deterrence efforts and foster a national (and potentially global response), as required.  In practice, cyber incidents are rarely fully understood in the short term. Rather the full impact and understanding of the incident unfolds over time. As such, we suggest that the SEC require periodic updates, possibly filed with ongoing quarterly and annual reporting. Such a procedure not only provides an accurate view of the situation but also fulfills all three roles of the SEC.  2.2 Designate certain large providers as systemically important cyber risk institutions  Rajgopal and Gezer (2018) suggest that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is clearly a systemic risk.4 But we currently have no idea how many public (and private companies) are hooked into AWS, and what the cumulative dollar value of business interruption for companies reliant on AWS might be. A vulnerable API (application programming interface) from a relatively small startup company on AWS has the potential to bring down electronic commerce in a large part of our economy. One can extend this argument to several cloud providers such as Salesforce, Google and Microsoft and Apple.  The SEC might want to consider more expansive disclosures of cyber risk of systemically important cyber institutions and enhanced enforcement of such disclosures.  We also suggest that these systemically important cyber institutions be subject to scenario based testing to identify their ability to withstand and recover from cyber incidents and the outcomes of these tests be reported to investors. These tests would be the cyber equivalent of subjecting certain systemically important financial institutions to stress tests (i.e., Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)). Such tests and reporting thereof may also lead to expansion of NGO efforts, such  4 Gezer and Rajgopal. FORTUNE, October 4, 2018. Available at https://fortune.com/2018/10/04/facebook data breach accounts hacked/  as Sheltered Harbor5, into other sectors to promote operational resilience. We are aware of some efforts in this area but those are largely grass roots initiatives and often sector specific. Greater focus on disclosures of systemically important cyber institutions will cover all the three of the SECs stated roles, especially related to the orderly functioning of markets and efficient capital allocation.  2.3 Require disclosures on the value of lost IP and data  We are concerned about the value of intellectual property that is being stolen by hackers from U.S. companies, especially at the behest of state actors. Requiring companies to measure and hence report the loss of intellectual property will shed more light on this pressing issue and potentially create investor pressure on companies to fortify their defenses or advocate more strongly with appropriate government agencies to stop or counter the loss of such IP.  The value of the lost IP and data needs to address not only the value to the entity but also to the capital markets and the economy. For example, several reports commissioned by the private sector and at least two branches of government (i.e., Legislative, Executive) have designated certain technologies and data key to our long term viability as a nation: (i) the Cyberspace Solarium Commission6; (ii) the Economic Report of the President7; and by (iii) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In 2014, The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that stolen IP cost the U.S. Economy between $200 billion and $250 billion annually.8 This number has clearly grown in the recent past. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) estimates an annual loss of approximately $57 billion from the theft of IP, which prompted them to create the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) and forced all defense contractors to comply if they want to continue in the defense business.  The disclosure must address how the lost IP and data affect the organization but also the larger economy. For example, we know artificial intelligence, the bio economy, autonomous systems, quantum information science and technology, and semiconductors. are highly valued by our adversaries and threaten U.S. presence on the global stage in the long term.9  The Marriott delayed disclosure mentioned earlier is an example of where the delayed reporting likely impacted others. Many believe the more significant impact of this particular Marriott breach is the credential harvesting and intelligence gathered by hackers to execute additional attacks. The delayed reporting prevented others from taking corrective action. Even if only the informal notice described in this letter were provided, others could have been notified and hence could have decided for themselves if corrective action was warranted. 5 Sheltered Harbor, https://shelteredharbor.org/ 6 https://www.solarium.gov/home  7 https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2019  8 Stolen Intellectual Property Harms American Businesses Says Acting Deputy Secretary Blank, Com. Blog (Nov. 29, 2011), http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2011/11/29/stolen intellectual property harms american businesses says acting deputy secretary .  9 https://www.dni.gov/index.php/ncsc newsroom/item/2254 ncsc fact sheet protecting critical and emerging u s technologies from foreign threats 2.4 Require disclosures on IT infrastructure and how its cyber hygiene is appropriate to protect its assets  Rajgopal and Gezer (2018) suggest that the SEC ask a company to clearly disclose the nature of its IT infrastructure.10 For example, is the infrastructure located on the companys premises, or is it outsourced? And what is the dollar budget devoted to that infrastructure? The budget, as compared to the total revenue of a business, will give investors a sense for whether the firm under invests in such infrastructure. Doing so also helps investors and other stakeholders understand the organizations reliance on technology and data.  We recommend disclosure on both hardware and software spending for the business, including data on personnel and training, and specific disclosure of the cybersecurity budget. If any material portion of the IT infrastructure is outsourced, the company should disclose the vendors and provide an outline of the services provided by such vendors. The idea is to be able to create comparable ratios in industries to identify companies that under invest in this area. Disclosure on cybersecurity training is especially important, because 90% of cyberattacks exploit preventable human mistakes.  We recognize there is a balance between disclosing sufficient information to meet the SECs three roles while not providing adversaries insights into how best to attack the enterprise. For example, the new rules propose disclosing an organizations policies and procedures. In practice, this is not practical because of the sheer volume of data and rate of change involved. It also has the deleterious effect of making the hackers job easier by providing deeper insight into the organization. A boilerplate disclosure is of no use to investors either. Hence, we see only downside to disclosing excessively detailed policies and procedures.  2.5 Require disclosures of the daily value of business interruption  If an automotive company produces 120,000 cars per year and the revenue per car is $10,000, the daily revenue lost by a cyberattack to its factory that relies heavily in robotics would be around $3.3 million.  Skeptics might wonder whether revealing this would represent an open invitation to hackers to go after a company. We counter argue that hackers are already aware of high value targets. Better disclosures about, at least, the ranges of daily value of business interruption would reduce investors estimation risk associated with evaluating the cash flow loss from an attack.  Historically, reports have largely focused on the value of assets including data. Over the years we have seen an exponential growth in attacks on availability. Ransomware is a prime example. Ransomware is effective because it prevents an organization from operating by denying access to its data. The total cost is a mix of loss of operations, cost of recovery, and reputational loss.  As we have seen with incidents at Colonial Pipeline and JBS (meat packing), these attacks can take a business offline and can result in a loss of revenue, expose the organization to liabilities, and erode its reputation. In 2016 the Justice Department unsealed indictments against individuals allegedly working on behalf of the Iranian government accused of carrying out distributed denial of service attacks 10 Gezer and Rajgopal. Fortune, October 4, 2018. Available at https://fortune.com/2018/10/04/facebook data breach accounts hacked/  against dozens of American banks as well as attempting to seize control of Bowman Dam outside New York City.11  Knowing the daily value of business interruption goes a long way towards fulfilling all of the SECs three roles while enabling investors and stakeholders to make informed capital allocation decisions.  2.6 Require disclosures of continuity planning  A continuity plan identifies the critical information an organization needs to continue operating during an unplanned event, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. The plan then highlights systems and processes that must be sustained and details how the company plans to keep these going.  We request the SEC to consider asking companies for disclosures on continuity planning.  While we understand there may be reluctance to openly disclose the full plan because of the benefit to the adversaries, a set of basic metrics, common to the discipline can be disclosed. For example, the SEC might want to consider the following measures:  • Frequency and extent of Business Impact Assessments (BIA)12 • Recovery Time Objective (RTO)13 • Recovery Point Objective (RPO)14 • Service Delivery Option (SDO)15 • Maximum Tolerable Outage (MTO)16.  In this increasingly connected world and the with the rise of incidents from third parties, the disclosure requirements should go one step further. At a minimum, the essence of an organizations Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) program needs to be disclosed. Organizations who are required by others to meet their obligations must disclose such obligations (e.g., if an organization starts incurring fines as per its contract after being unavailable for four hours).  2.7 Board composition  The SEC rules ask about board composition. We absolutely believe it is important to disclose the cyber expertise of the board to meet the SECs three stated roles. However, we believe, it is equally important to not require the expertise of particular individuals or their roles in cyber specific activities be disclosed. Making such disclosure voluntary is necessary to protect both the organization and promote access to board members of the highest quality. Disclosing specific expertise or roles of board members could make them and their families targets of nefarious activities such as extortion and doxing. Hence, the organization and/or the individuals may choose to make this level of disclosure, but it should not be mandated.  11 https://www.justice.gov/usao sdny/pr/manhattan us attorney announces charges against seven iranians conducting coordinated 12 https://www.ready.gov/business impact analysis  13 https://www.acronis.com/en us/blog/posts/rto rpo/  14 https://www.acronis.com/en us/blog/posts/rto rpo/  15 https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/service delivery objective sdo  16 https://csrc nist.gov/glossary/term/maximum_tolerable_downtime  As usual, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or would like to explore any of these points further.

Peirce Commissioner Allison Herren Lee Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20459  1090 Email: rule  comments@sec.gov Re: Comment on Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File Number S7 09 22)  Dear Chair and Commissioners:  We the undersigned, writing in our individual capacities as seasoned practitioners who bring deep private and public sector experience in strengthening both corporate governance incentives and processes, and the proactive mitigation and remediation of businesses exposure to information risks attendant to cyber intrusions, urge the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) to adopt a comprehensive rule pertaining to the way in which public companies executives and boards of directors should (i) ensure there is robust, integrated cybersecurity oversight by the management and the board; (ii) systemically identify and mitigate firms short and long run cybersecurity risks; (iii) design and execute a dynamic cybersecurity strategy that provides for contemporaneous assessments of risk management should breaches occur; and (iv) rapidly disclose incidents and articulate the lessons learned. To this end, the Commission is to be commended for its proposed rule—File Number S7 09 22— published on March 9, 2022. It holds great promise for significant reform of public companies oversight and management of cyber risks—both in C suites and boardrooms. However, we believe the proposed rules can be strengthened. In our Comment, we focus on several points that we urge the Commission to consider in its finalization of the rule prior to its adoption.  1.

Backdrop: Induced Changes in Business Disclosure Responses to Cybersecurity Attacks Are Improving the Governance Environment The rapidly changing threat landscape, ranging from corporates being compelled by ransomware to release intellectual property (IP) to having to shut down infrastructure, has made it increasingly difficult for companies to manage cyber risks. As a result, whereas past victims tended to keep attacks secret, theyre now being encouraged, and even required, to disclose more information with the insurers that are protecting them from liability.  Industry wide, more than 80% of cyber insurers reported a rise in cyber claims in the fourth quarter of 2021, many related to ransomware attacks, forcing premiums up by 34%. That was the 17th straight quarter in which insurance rates rose. 3  The changes in disclosure behavior are assisting both the companies and their insurers to not only better predict and calculate the cost of cyber attacks, but it is also inducing insurance providers to sell cyber insurance more as a service than as a transaction. That is a metaphor for the transformation of corporate behavior towards cybersecurity risks in a fundamentally changed environment.  Moreover, rather than simply completing insurance forms detailing their cyber practices and then paying their premia, corporates are working with insurers to regularly monitor activity on their network and collecting and analyzing file logs. Insurance providers are assessing organizations cybersecurity performance, providing metrics and benchmarking them against peers. This process is demonstrating to businesses the value of transparency. At the same time, as cyber breach incidents have become so broad and frequent, some insurers have pulled out of the cyber insurance sector completely. This, of course, increases pressure on companies to properly manage their risk exposure and spend more on acquiring talented people and embracing cutting edge enterprise technologies.  3. Boards of Directors and Executive Teams Have Shared Responsibilities in Cybersecurity Governance, But Greater Delineation is Needed for the Roles and Qualifications of Each  The Commissions proposed rules require the disclosure by companies of the way in which their cybersecurity governance is overseen by management teams and boards. However, the specificity of the criteria to be met in both cases is lacking. a) Management  The proposed rules would require firms to (1) specify managements roles and responsibilities for overseeing cybersecurity; (2) delineate the process by which management is informed about breaches and how they monitor their prevention, mitigation, detection; and (3) indicate how frequently management is to update the board on cybersecurity risks, threat events and breaches. These are all laudable stipulations. While it is understandable that there will be variation across firms of different sizes, sectors, etc. in their definition, the Commission would do well to establish the criteria by which firms must go about this process. The Commission should also give consideration to suggesting a model template for firms to follow in going through this process. Even more importantly, the final rule should require companies to specify the qualifications of executives overseeing cybersecurity within the firm.  b) Boards Many corporate boards have made significant progress understanding the importance of how cybersecurity affects the competitive health, operational resilience, investment appeal, customer loyalty, and reputation of the companies they oversee. Theyve certainly gotten the message that enhancing cybersecurity is not just an IT issue but lies at the core of businesses state of the art corporate governance practices. It is surely a crucial part of the G in ESG. There are several instances in the last two years relating to the landmark Caremark case that established the key role and performance criteria of corporate director responsibilities and liabilities when it comes to the exercise of risk oversight. Establishing a robust boardroom approach to effective cybersecurity risk oversight necessitates specifying board member competencies, board structure and the boards approach to understanding such risk, including systemic risk.  4  But most board directors have yet to move far enough along to become as effectively equipped as they should be to intelligently gauge the extent to which their firms executive teams are at the top of their games in the war on corporate cyber attacks.1  Few directors—even those who serve on board Risk Committees—engage C suite executives in rigorous dialogue on the specific strategies theyre undertaking to reduce vulnerabilities to hacks and why particular approaches rather than others are being employed.  Indeed, boards who effectively devolve full oversight of cybersecurity to their Risk Committees are myopic. While boards Risk Committees should take the lead, becoming adept at understanding cyber risks and how to mitigate them are truly cross cutting since mistakes can threaten the lifeblood of the company, its workers, its reputation, and its long run growth. Where boards assessments of the impact of cyber risks on business operations most assuredly should not take place is the Audit Committee. After all, audits are backward looking. Cyber threats are largely contemporaneous and forward looking dangers to the enterprise. Boards not only need to be better educated about cyber threats but also able to engage in a robust dialogue with the executive team about such risks, including how to evaluate the performance of the relevant managers who are responsible for their mitigation.  Regrettably, however, many board members are intimidated to ask the executives who are most centrally responsible for cybersecurity—traditionally Chief Information Officers (CIOs), but increasingly Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)—all but the most general technical questions. Even then, the issues that board directors raise with the executive team are almost always focus on the magnitude of the problem and the degree to which the CIOs/CISOs believe they have existing threats contained. It is rare that discussions in the boardroom delve deeply into the solutions the executives have either already instituted or are contemplating doing so. Some, perhaps many, board members become well versed to ask their firms Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) technical questions about financial reporting and related details. Yet when it comes to cyber, the conversations are thin. Of course, the Sarbanes Oxley Act mandated public (and some private) companies to disclose to the Commission which of their directors are qualified financial experts.  To this end, the Commissions proposed rule for ensuring boards have directors who are knowledgeable about cybersecurity is a good start. But more should be stipulated by the Commission.  For example, the proposed rules would require disclosure of (1) which board members are responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks; (2) the frequency and process by which the board is informed about cybersecurity risks; and (3) whether and how the board considers cybersecurity risks as part of its business strategy, risk management and financial oversight.  However, the Commission should require companies to focus on specifying the qualifications of the directors overseeing cybersecurity on the board. In particular, similar to the SECs approach for mandatory disclosure of qualified financial experts, boards should be required to designate qualified cyber experts to ensure the given set of qualifications are met.2  1 See Forbes: Corporate Boards Oversight Of Cyber Risks Is Too Passive (November 2018), available at: https://www.forbes.com/sites/harrybroadman/2018/11/28/corporate boards oversight of cyber risks is too passive/?sh=7f129e401f81 2 See Forbes: Boards Can Surmount The Cybersecurity ‘Intimidation Factor: 10 Questions Directors Should Discuss With C Suites (December 2021), available at: https://www.forbes.com/sites/harrybroadman/2021/12/31/boards can surmount the cybersecurity intimidation factor 10 questions directors should discuss with c suites/?sh=552554d79508 5  4. Disclosures of Material Cybersecurity Incidents  The Commissions proposed rules would require a company to file a Form 8 K within four (4) business days of a material cybersecurity incident. This is a good step forward.  However, the proposed rules do not specify how to determine materiality of a cybersecurity incident. Instead, they suggest an evaluation based on the total mix of information, as is the case with other materiality determinations under federal securities laws. Determining the materiality of cyber breaches is different than other incidents due to (a) the potential for broader financial and reputational impacts, (b) scope of the breach is difficult to ascertain, and (c) assessment of the impact can change between the short and long term phases of the investigation, especially for incidents that were ongoing for months or years. Companies are responding to internal and external cybersecurity incidents on a daily, and in some industries, hourly basis. There needs to be a discrete set of evaluation criteria to assess incidents materiality. Without such criteria, the ambiguity and complexity of the evaluation could lead to over or under reporting of material incidents. The result could well be that the disclosure requirement would be ineffective. With proper evaluation criteria to determine a material incident, public companies could more effectively, and consistently, assess these diverse set of incidents and engender a reliable disclosure process.  5. Disclosures Regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy The proposed Commission rules would amend Regulation S K in which companies would have to disclose information regarding their cybersecurity risk management strategies. This would include providing a description of the companys policies and procedures for identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity threats.  In addition, the proposed rules would require companies to describe their cybersecurity risk assessment program, including whether the company engages third parties to make such assessments and whether the companys financial condition is reasonably likely to be affected by cybersecurity risks and incidents of varying character and magnitude.  The Commission, or an independent group, such as the newly formed CSC 2.0 Non profit3, should consider establishing benchmarks as to the quality and coverage of a given firms level of cybersecurity—perhaps analogous to the Financial Strength Ratings.  6. Holistic Approach to Cyber Risk Management  The proposed Commission rules should require companies to formulate a holistic 360° approach to addressing cyber risks—one that is inclusive of business processes, the technologies utilized, and the people in charge.  Threat actors are no longer just exploiting technical weakness in companies cyber defenses, they are actively attacking companies business process and applications as well as the people responsible for managing them. For example, threat actors have compromised companies sub contractors in order to gather confidential information and operating details. These data have been used to create a sophisticated business pretext, combined with technical access, to cause companies staff to by pass protocols and wire millions of dollars to numerous off share accounts.  Consequently, cybersecurity insurers and bond underwriters are requesting companies to detail their cyber threat resilience strategies so they can be assessed. Companies may then be required to address deficiencies found. 3 Website available at: https://www.cybersolarium.org/ 6  The Commission should require companies on a regular basis to both disclose their cyber readiness metrics and marshal evidence as to how they are complying with them. To this end, the Commission should consider issuing a template as to best practices for devising such metrics and assessing their compliance. Conclusion  We appreciate the Commissions invitation to comment on the proposed rule. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, _________________________________ Dr. Harry G.

Request for Comment  1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants?  As a general statement, investors would certainly benefit from greater insight into cybersecurity incidents via Form 8 K. The time allowed before filing a Form 8 K may be problematic when dealing with complex cyber incidents that take more than four days to investigate. Public disclosure of an investigation may alter an adversarys tactics, if they are still executing their attack. If law enforcement is involved, investigations will almost certainly take more than four days. In the short run, it is my opinion that the need for discretion by investigators and law enforcement officials is of greater importance than an investors need for early incident information. Once disclosure of an investigation no longer puts that effort at risk, disclosure via Form 8 K will provide the relevant information to investors.  A gap that I see in the current language is the use of the word material? If left to individual companies to decide, materiality will vary greatly leaving investors in a position where they have more information, but it will be inconsistent across their portfolio. Some guardrails around the definition of materiality would be helpful in determining what cyber incidents must be reported via Form 8 K.  2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident that Item 1.05 should require?  The information included in the draft Form 8 K would provide the average investor sufficient information to assess any impact to their investment strategy. One possible addition would be the estimated duration of the event, especially in the event of an aggregated cyber incident. The current information to be requested identifies when an incident was discovered; however, it does not specify disclosing if that incident has been affecting systems or data for a prolonged period.  3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example, should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the registrants next periodic report? If so, which disclosures?  Four days is a very short period to investigate and determine the full effect of a complex cyber incident. Premature notification may cause an attacker to change tactics or clean up their tracks before investigators can prevent such actions. Notification of a cyber incident within four days of detection may also invite other attackers to take advantage of the situation. While a company is busy investigating and defending against one attack, a second attacker may find it easier to infiltrate the company through the same or different means than the first. Disclosure of a cyber incident prior to having a reasonable opportunity to closing the point of intrusion will increase the risk of a secondary incident. Postponing disclosure of remediation status or specific operational impacts until a later time would reduce that risk.  4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures?  Complex cyber incidents may not have completed their investigation withing four days of detection which would make the completion of Form 8 K impossible. Simple incidents that are wrapped up in four days or less wouldnt likely reach the threshold of being material. A reporting window of thirty to sixty days would provide more opportunity for the company to complete an investigation and take necessary precautions to prevent a second attack utilizing the same point of entry. Form 8 K could still be utilized for that disclosure.  5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold? Disclosure of security events that have not been deemed an incident with material impact would be a bad idea. The volume of notifications would quickly drown out a disclosure worth elevation and reporting. As noted before, there should be some definition of materiality to guide companies on what warrants disclosure. Measures based on a percentage of assets, revenues, income, or other scalable data points would be recommended to leverage a single scale across companies of various sizes. There may also be non numerical measures based on the market vertical that the company is apart of.  6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations while providing these timely disclosures to investors? What costs would registrants face in determining the extent of a potential conflict? No comment.  7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security? Any request from the Attorney General, a court, or federal law enforcement should pause the disclosure requirements under this rule change.  8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt? Depending upon the definition of materiality and the data points required to calculate it, some companies may not be able to adequately calculate such a measure regardless of the timeline.  9. Should certain registrants that would be within the scope of the proposed requirements, but that are subject to other cybersecurity related regulations, or that would be included in the scope of the Commissions recently proposed cybersecurity rules for advisers and funds, if adopted, be excluded from the proposed requirements? For example, should the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirements or the other disclosure requirements described in this release, as applicable, exclude business development companies (BDCs), or the publicly traded parent of an adviser? No comment.  10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? Depending upon the definition of materiality and the data points required to calculate it, some companies may not be able to adequately calculate such a measure. If properly defined, it will be more difficult for a company to claim an inability to estimate the materiality of a cyber incident. A refined, financial quantification of a cyber incident is a mature capability that many companies have decided not to invest in due to competing priorities.  11. We are proposing that registrants be required to file rather than permitted to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Should we instead permit registrants to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such that the Form 8 K would not be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act unless the registrant specifically states that the information is to be considered filed or incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or Exchange Act? No comment.  12. We note above a non exclusive list of examples that would merit disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K covers some, but not all, types of material cybersecurity incidents. Are there additional examples we should address? Should we include a non exclusive list of examples in Item 1.05 of Form 8 K?  As for the types of incidents, the list is well crafted. Materiality must still be incorporated before determining the need to disclose. For example, a single laptop being infected with ransomware would not be worth disclosing; however, 50% of a company being infected and a ransom demanded would certainly warrant disclosure.  13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 for failure to timely file a Form 8 K, as proposed? No comment.  14. 14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3?  No comment.  15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K in the registrants quarterly or annual report, as proposed? Are there instances, other than to correct inaccurate or materially misleading prior disclosures, when a registrant should be required to update its report on Form 8 K or file another Form 8 K instead of providing disclosure of material changes, additions, or updates in a subsequent Form 10 Q or Form 10 K? Updates on a cyber incident should be included in an updated Form 8 K. A summary of filed Form 8 Ks should be included in the quarterly and annual reports.  16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to provide disclosure in Form 8 K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate?  A series of immaterial cyber incidents that reveal an systemic issue with material impact should be disclosed via Form 8 K as though it were a singular cyber incident with material impact. Many cyber incidents begin with smaller events that culminate with a large incident.  17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? The existence of cybersecurity policies and procedures is warranted and provide a baseline level of information to an investor that the company is taking the necessary threats into due consideration. I would not, however, advise that companies be required to disclose the contents of those policies or procedures. If an attacker understands the methods that a company uses to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents, they will be able to adjust their tactics to evade detection.  18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? The definitions suit the current scope of the proposed rule changes.  19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. We could define the term to mean, for example: any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would better define cybersecurity? I do not believe that defining cybersecurity is particularly necessary. There is a generally accepted definition of cybersecurity that exceeds the boundaries of what is considered in this proposed rule change.  20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors?  Such details would not be useful to an investor. Investors should be concerned with whether or not the company is employing tactics to reduce their cybersecurity risk posture, not the type of badge an individual wears when completing the work.  21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? Yes. This disclosure would be particularly pertinent to an investor because it identifies a very low level of maturity that could be a major concern for many investors.  22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? As stated above, the existence of cybersecurity policies and procedures is warranted and provide a baseline level of information to an investor that the company is taking the necessary threats into due consideration. I would not, however, advise that companies be required to disclose the contents of those policies or procedures. If an attacker understands the methods that a company uses to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents, they will be able to adjust their tactics to evade detection.  23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? I recommend the same reporting requirements for all publicly traded companies regardless of size and market vertical.  24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or asset backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? I recommend the same reporting requirements for all publicly traded companies as of the day that they become publicly traded.  25. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (Board leadership structure and role in oversight) with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross references in Item 106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? No comment.  26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way?  The proposed information would be useful to an informed investor as it identifies the experience of directors in the field of cybersecurity, be it as a practitioner or executive.  27. Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)(1)? Would a requirement to name such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving on a board of directors? Since directors are disclosed by name in other filings, a description of ones background would be easy to match based on other publicly available information. I do not believe that disclosing a directors name, along with the background in these forms, would be a deterrent to serving on a board.  28. When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors, should the registrant be required to state expressly that this is the case under proposed Item 407(j)(1)? As proposed, we would not require a registrant to make such an explicit statement. If a board does not have a director with cybersecurity experience, I would recommend requiring a response as to how the company fills that experience void. The company may leverage internal executives or non voting advocates when cybersecurity subjects require attention.  29. Proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to describe fully the nature of a board members expertise in cybersecurity without mandating specific disclosures. Is there particular information that we should instead require a registrant to disclose with respect to a board members expertise in cybersecurity? The recommended information appears to be a good starting point that may warrant amendments over time.  30. As proposed, Item 407(j)(1) includes a non exclusive list of criteria that a company should consider in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Are these factors for registrants to consider useful in determining cybersecurity expertise? Should the list be revised, eliminated, or supplemented? No changes recommended at this time.  31. Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants? If so, how? No.  32. Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual report and proxy or information statement, as proposed? The information should be included in the annual report alongside other pertinent company information.  33. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 407(j) overlap with disclosure required under Item 401(e) of Regulation S K with respect to the business experience of directors? Are there alternative approaches that would avoid duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? No comment.  34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) define the term expertise? If so, how should we define the term? Since there is not a minimum requirement that is demanded of a director, expertise simply refers to the level of knowledge that the individual possesses on the subject. No further definition is really required at this time.  35. Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs, be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants? I recommend the same reporting requirements for all publicly traded companies regardless of size and market vertical.  36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should consider? No comment.  37. As proposed, disclosure under Item 407(j) would be required in a proxy or information statement. Should we require the disclosure under Item 407(j) to appear in a registrants proxy or information statement regardless of whether the registrant is relying on General Instruction G(3)? Is this information relevant to a security holders decision to vote for a particular director? No comment.  38. Should we amend Form 20 F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form 6 K, as proposed, to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic? Are there unique considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts? No comment.  39. We are not proposing any changes to Form 40 F. Should we instead require an MJDS issuer filing an annual report on Form 40 F to comply with the Commissions specific proposed cybersecurity related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10 K or Form 20 F filers? No comment.  40. Should we require registrants to tag the disclosures required by proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and Items 106 and 407(j) of Regulation S K in Inline XBRL, as proposed? Are there any changes we should make to ensure accurate and consistent tagging? If so, what changes should we make? Should we require registrants to use a different structured data language to tag these disclosures? If so, what structured data language should we require? Are there any registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs that we should exempt from the tagging requirement?  Tagging will make analysis by informed investors faster and more consistent. No recommended changes at this time.  41. What are the economic effects of the proposed cybersecurity incident and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosures? Would those disclosures provide informational benefits to investors? Would registrants benefit from a potential decrease in cost of capital because of the enhanced disclosure? Are there any other benefits, costs, and indirect effects of the proposed disclosure that we should also consider? Any additional information that is provided to investors will prove useful; however, incomplete information may result in investors drawing inaccurate conclusions. Increased disclosure requirements will result in increased costs for the registrants regardless of the economic theory reviewed. Additional costs will be incurred to execute disclosure processes and resolve questions and disputes that arise from said disclosures. Companies with strong risk management and cybersecurity capabilities may not incur additional capital costs, the notion that they may see a reduction in capital costs due to increased disclosures is unrealistic.  42. Would the proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure provide enough information for investors to assess the impact of a cybersecurity incident in making an investment decision? Because the proposed incident disclosure would not require quantification of an incidents impact, would the lack of quantification create any uncertainty for investors which may cause them to under or overreact to the disclosure? Would investors benefit more if registrants were to provide the disclosure after the incidents impact is quantified or can be reasonably estimated? If so, what metrics should be disclose to help investors understand the impact? Quantification of the impact of a cyber incident would provide a significantly improved view of the impact to the company if the unit of measure is consistent across companies. Investors will be looking at these disclosures, along with other data inputs, to make comparisons between possible investments. A common unit of measure is the best means of supporting that decision process. In the absence of quantification, investors will need to evaluate the subjective information for themselves based on their own knowledge of cybersecurity.  43. Would both types of the proposed disclosure, cybersecurity incident disclosure and cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure, increase the vulnerability of registrants to cybersecurity incidents? Would this effect be mitigated by any of the other effects of the proposal, including indirect effects such as registrants potential strengthening of cybersecurity risk management measures? What would be the impact of the proposed disclosure on the likelihood of future incidents for registrants? Would that impact be the same for both types of disclosure? There is an immediate and greater potential impact on a registrants disclosure of a cyber incident within 4 days of discovery. Few organizations will be able to fully remediate or mitigate a significant vulnerability prior to disclosure, which will create an opportunity for other attacks. There are long term benefits from improvements in a companys risk management and cyber capabilities, which should reduce the potential impact and likelihood of a cyber incident; however, there are short term increases to both risk and likelihood.  There is a potential impact that disclosing what policies and procedures are in place will reveal a weakness in the companys security posture. This could disclose a vulnerability that an attacker could take advantage of thus creating a new cyber incident as a result of the disclosure. It is important to note that the company, in this situation, is already at risk of a cyber incident; however, the disclosure would expose that vulnerability to the general public. 44. Would the proposed incident disclosure increase registrants compliance costs to fulfill the proposed disclosure requirements related to incident reporting? What would be the magnitude of those costs? Would the proposed cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure lead to indirect costs such as hiring a board member or staff to their management team with cybersecurity expertise, or costs to devise, implement or improve the processes and procedures related to cybersecurity? Additional costs will be incurred to execute disclosure processes and resolve questions and disputes that arise from said disclosures. The magnitude of those costs is not going to be uniform across companies. Various industries have existing disclosure requirements in place, some have voluntary disclosure processes with information sharing exchanges, while others have little to no external disclosure processes. Additional costs could include hiring additional personnel on the board of directors or support staff, if such personnel do not already exist within the company. Companies with less mature cybersecurity programs will likely see pressure for additional investments in cyber capabilities.  45. Would both types of the proposed disclosure lead to indirect economic effects for external stakeholders? Would the magnitude of the indirect effects be greater or less than we have discussed? Are there any other indirect effects that we should consider? No comment.  46. Are there any specific data points that would be valuable for assessing the economic effects of the proposed cybersecurity incident and risk management, strategy, and governance that we should consider in the baseline analysis or the analysis of the economic effects? If so, please provide that data. No comment.  47. Would any of the economic effects discussed above be more or less significant than in our assessment? Are any of the costs or benefits identified incorrectly for any of the proposed amendments? Are there any other economic effects associated with these proposed rules that we should consider? Are you aware of any data or methodology that can help quantify the benefits or costs of the proposed amendments? No comment.  48. Would any of the proposed amendments positively affect efficiency, competition and capital formation as we have discussed? Are there any other effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that we should consider? No comment.  49. Would any of the proposed amendments have disproportionate costs for smaller reporting companies? Do smaller reporting companies face a different set of cybersecurity risks than other companies? Each company has a unique risk profile based on the internal threats, external threats, existing capabilities, market, geolocation, etc. Smaller companies definitely possess a different set of cybersecurity risks than larger counterparts in the same industry. Smaller companies typically have smaller cybersecurity programs which will likely find external disclosures more difficult to complete on schedule. The same personnel that are responsible for investigating the cyber incident will likely be responsible for conducting the external disclosure.  50. Are there any other alternative approaches to improve disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity risk management, strategy, or governance that we should consider? If so, what are they and what would be the associated costs or benefits of these alternative approaches? The primary concern that I have with the proposal, as laid out, is the timing of the disclosure. Investors have a right to be informed of the cybersecurity posture a company has if they are considering making an investment in that company. That need for information does not outweigh the need for the company and law enforcement resources to conduct a proper investigation. Furthermore, a company should have the right to remediate or mitigate exploited vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure of a cyber incident. I would propose altering the timeline for disclosure and providing for an elongated timeline when deemed necessary by law enforcement.  51. Are there any other costs and benefits associated with alternative approaches that are not identified or are misidentified in the above analysis? Should we consider any of the alternative approaches outlined above instead of the proposed rules? Which approach and why?  No recommendations at this time.",2

Adams Street  |  Chicago, IL 60661 May 9, 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington DC, 20549  Re: File Number S7 09 22 SECs Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure  To Whom It May Concern:  TransUnion welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Security and Exchange Commissions proposed rule. As one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies (CRAs), we hold valuable data that enables businesses, customers, and consumers to transact with confidence. We are committed to protecting that information and ensuring that our regulators, investors, consumers, and associates have adequate and useful information about our operations, including responsible disclosure of cyber risks and incidents. To ensure that we remain vigilant stewards of data, we act with care and responsibility with the data we source, analyze and protect, leveraging advanced technology and an uncompromising stance toward information security, ethics and governance. With a strong emphasis on these frameworks and highly qualified associates, we safely provide data solutions that help consumers, businesses and the economy. This letter provides our perspectives on: I. Materiality II. Ongoing Investigations III. Timing of Notifications IV. Potential for Additional Risks I. Materiality The proposed rule relies on the concept of materiality as a trigger for required reporting. While the rule appropriately allows time for a firm to determine whether an incident is material, the lack of definition for what constitutes a material breach leaves companies subject to the rule without clarity as to the key determination that must be made. Although the concept of materiality has been applied to disclosures of other sorts, those situations have the benefit of decades of case law, guidance, and analysis to direct the determination. The standard for what constitutes a cyber issue of significance to a reasonable investor is far less clear, and  without more  will likely remain a moving target, subject to refinement in litigation.1 Furthermore, this lack of clarity will likely prove an inviting target for frivolous lawsuits that will distract the attention 1 The examples set forth in Section B.2 highlight this challenge. What the threshold would be for an investor to be concerned about one of these types of incidents is very difficult to predict. And over disclosure, as the materiality standard implicitly recognizes, is far from costless  in the current environment, it would likely involve substantial amounts of unnecessary work reporting the range of incidents that a company may face. transunion.com of a firms information security experts from performing their most important duties. To address these issues, any final rule must include greater definition to ground the principle of materiality in more objective and readily applicable parameters. The term material in the aggregate poses similar issues. More definition is needed as to how a company should aggregate  Which incidents are sufficiently related? How many incidents constitute material in the aggregate? Additional information is needed to ensure that companies can effectively and efficiently comply with the law. II. Ongoing Investigations  Investigations into potential cybersecurity incidents are highly sensitive matters where extreme caution is required to avoid alerting a potential bad actor about what the company knows and what it is planning to do. Early disclosure can alert the source of a threat, undermining the ability of a company to identify and remediate issues and inhibiting the determination by a company or law enforcement of the identities of bad actors and their methods. The proposed rules preemption of a notification delay for internal and external investigations, even in the face of a law enforcement request, runs contrary to these essential functions, and to the expressed view of other government agencies requesting notification holds.2 The interest of investors in transparency cannot override the need to effectively resolve an issue and prevent its reoccurrence, which itself is in the interest of not just one companys shareholders but the shareholders of any other company that may be under a similar threat. Any final rule should incorporate a notification delay (or at least a delay of public notice) to allow companies and government agencies the ability to complete their investigation uninhibited.3 Relatedly, while we appreciate the motivation behind disclosing more information to investors, the rule fails to explain why investors need reporting of an ongoing investigation  with all the uncertainty and lack of firm conclusions that entails  rather than a final report that provides complete and well vetted analysis of an incident and its impact. Unless there is a particular reason for early notification to investors, the Commission need not apply the same timeline to investor notification as it does to Commission notification, and should instead require the filing of the Form 8 K only after a final report can be issued. III. Timing of Notifications The proposed rule sets a deadline of four business days from the determination of materiality to the filing of the Form 8 K. That turnaround is simply too short to collect and present the necessary information accurately and will inevitably lead to mistakes that do the opposite of what the rule intends  disclosures will misdirect the Commission and investors, rather than provide clarity.4 Furthermore, as noted above, a notification at such an early stage  even of the limited set of information requested by the Commission  could be detrimental to the ongoing investigation and remediation. Accordingly, a final rule must allow for more time from the determination of materiality to the disclosure.   2 Many jurisdictions, including the federal government under HIPPA, explicitly recognize the necessity of delayed no ification where law enforcement makes such a request.  3 The proposal asks whether a notification delay should be permitted where the Attorney General makes a written determination that the delay would be in the interest of national security. While this would be a good step, it is far from sufficient, as it doesnt allow for other law enforcement agencies or companies to express similar pressing needs.  4 The proposed rule does not set forth any specific reason why four days, rather than a somewhat longer period of time, is appropriate. transunion.com IV. Potential for Additional Risks  Finally, before finalizing any rule relating to the disclosure of cybersecurity incidents, policies, procedures, and governance, the Commission should solicit and review specific comments relating to whether this type of information may actually assist threat actors in identifying potential targets. Even a cautious firm may  in endeavoring to be responsive to the Commissions directives  inadvertently reveal a detail that would provide a window into the firms security protocols. Without fully analyzing this risk and ensuring that the rules will set forth parameters and limits to ensure that this does not happen, the potential for negative unintended consequences will remain high. In conclusion, we appreciate the Commissions willingness to examine and develop best practices around cybersecurity incidents. TransUnion looks forward to working with the Commission in its effort to enhance and standardize disclosures related cybersecurity risk management.

Countryman Secretary  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  RE:  Proposed Rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure; Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529; File No. S7 09 22 (March 9, 2022)  Dear Ms. Countryman:  Virtu Financial, Inc.1 (Virtu) respectfully submits this letter in response to the above referenced rule proposal issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or Commission) on March 9, 2022 (the Proposal).2 In the Proposal, the Commission seeks public comment on prescriptive and inflexible disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting by public companies. More specifically, the Proposal would require the following:   Current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K;   Periodic disclosures regarding, among other things:  o A registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks;  o Managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures;  o Board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any, and board oversight of cybersecurity risk; and o Updated disclosures about previously reported material cybersecurity incidents.  First and foremost, like many public companies that operate in todays challenging world replete with nation states and criminals seeking to wreak cyber havoc, Virtu takes its cyber security obligations seriously and already discloses in its public filings the cyber risks it faces and its efforts  1 Virtu is a leading financial firm that leverages cutting edge technology to deliver liquidity to the global markets and innovative, transparent trading solutions to its clients.

Virtu broadly supports innovation and enhancements to transparency and fairness that increase liquidity and promote competition to the benefit of all marketplace participants.  2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Proposed Rule, Cyber Security Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release No.34 94382; File No. S7 09 22 (March 9, 2022),  available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/23/2022 05480/cybersecurity risk management strategy governance and incident disclosure.  2 to combat and manage those risks.3 Further, Virtu is a strong advocate of comprehensive disclosures that enable investors to make educated and fact based determinations in their respective financial decisions. However, the Proposal is the latest example of a recent and troubling Commission trend exceeding its legal authority by exercising unnecessary and unneeded micro management of the affairs of public companies. Commissioner Peirce, in her typical eloquent and succinct manner, described this ongoing problem in her dissent from the Proposal:  We must approach this topic, of course, through the prism of our mission. We have an important role to play in ensuring that investors get the information they need to understand issuers cybersecurity risks if they are material. This proposal, however, flirts with casting us as the nations cybersecurity command center, a role Congress did not give us. Our role with respect to public companies activities, cybersecurity or otherwise, is limited. The Commission regulates public companies disclosures; it does not regulate public companies activities. Companies register the offer and sale, and classes of securities with the Commission; they themselves are not registered with us, and we do not have the same authority over public companies as we do over investment advisers, broker dealers, or other registered entities.4 The Commission has many experienced and knowledgeable staff members that prepare well intended and meaningful guidance and proposals on matters that aid companies and the investing public. This Proposal is not one such example  respectfully, the staff does not have the necessary expertise to appropriately guide public companies on how to manage their cyber programs. As Commissioner Peirce stated [r]egulators may have a role to play in working with companies on cybersecurity, but we are not regulators with the necessary expertise.5 It is more appropriately the domain of company management to designs systems and protections based on their respective business model and associated risks. Instead, the Commission is seeking to expand its role as a prudential regulator by taking a seat at the management table of companies.  Further, the Proposal calls for the premature disclosure of information that could cause a company and its shareholders harm. The Proposal ignores that companies must have the unfettered ability to conduct investigations and coordinate with law enforcement in the event of a cyber breach. To mandate disclosure under prescriptive time frames would inevitably impact this critical need for a company to undertake such steps, posing significant risk of harm to the company and its shareholders. 3 See, Virtu Financial, Inc. 2021 Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, at pp 9 10, 23. 4 See SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal (March 9, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922. 5 Id.  3 A. The Proposal is unnecessary in light of existing disclosure regulations and previously issued Commission guidance  Broadly speaking, the Proposal raises an initial key question: what is the problem issue that needs to be addressed? That is, what is the problem that the Proposal is seeking to solve? First, as noted in the Proposal, public companies are already required to adhere to the general disclosure requirements set forth in Regulation S K and S X for reporting material items to shareholders. Moreover, the Commission has already issued two interpretative guides to public companies concerning the application of existing disclosure and other requirements under the current regulatory regime governing cyber risks and incidents:   In 2011, the Division of Corporation Finance issued interpretative guidance (the 2011 Staff Guidance) to public companies concerning disclosure obligations related to cyber security;6 and  In 2018, the Corporation Finance staff expanded upon the 2011 Staff Guidance and specifically referenced the existing regulatory requirements in Regulation S K and S X that require disclosure of cyber incidents (the 2018 Staff Guidance).7   The Commission contends that it has observed certain cybersecurity incidents that were reported in the media but were not disclosed in a registrants filings.8 The staff cites two studies that purportedly evidence a growing concern that material cybersecurity incidents are underreported  and that existing reporting may not be sufficiently timely.9 However, the staff also noted that [re]gistrants disclosures of both material cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management and governance have improved since the issuance of the 2011 Staff Guidance and the 2018 Interpretative Release.10 We respectfully submit that the solution to address the Commissions concerns about cyber incident underreporting is to reemphasize the 2011 and 2018 Staff Guidance and utilize its enforcement powers to ensure that public companies continue to report material cyber incidents. Prescriptive additional regulation is not the answer.   B. The four day reporting requirement for material cyber incidents may negatively impact shareholders and companies  The Commission proposes amending Form 8 K to require companies to disclose information about a cyber incident within four business days after the company determines that it  6 CF Disclosure Guidance: Topic No2 Cybersecurity (Oct. 13, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance topic2.htm. 7 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures (Feb. 18, 2018) available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance topic2.htm 8 See the Proposal at p. 16. 9 See Proposal at p.20. 10 See the Proposal at p.17.  4 has experienced a material cyber incident. The following information would be required to be included in the Form 8 K, to the extent such information is known at the time of the filing:  when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing;  a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident;  whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed, or used for any other unauthorized purpose;  the effect of the incident on the companys operations; and  whether the company has remediated or is currently remediating the incident.  There are a number of troubling aspects to this aggressive four business day requirement.  First, during the initial days of a cyber incident, a company may not have a full understanding of the nature of the issue. A forensic firm retained by the company may be in the midst of an analysis that is undeveloped and unfinished. Simply put, it may be too premature to conclusively determine what has occurred and how significant the issue may be to the companys operations. Forcing a company to disclose an uncertain and dynamic situation has the potential to cause significant harm to shareholders  investors would ostensibly be forced to make an investment decision on incomplete, uncertain, and evolving information.   Further, requiring a company to disclose details of remediations could, in fact, frustrate the overall goal of protecting the company. If the remediation is not complete, the disclosure could alert cyber attackers that the company is still vulnerable and exposed, resulting in additional hacks.  Lastly, Commissioner Peirce noted in her dissent, the Proposal does not consider the need to cooperate with, and sometimes defer to or take specific instructions from, federal government and state government prosecutors or officials. Ongoing governmental investigations may need to stay confidential for a certain period of time (again sometimes at the request of a prosecutor) and maintaining confidentiality could increase the chances of recovery of stolen funds or prevention of additional wrongdoing.   C. The materiality examples are helpful guidance but highly subjective.  The Proposal provides the following examples of cyber incidents that may need to be disclosed:   an unauthorized incident that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset (data, system, or network); or violated the registrants security policies or procedures. Incidents may stem from the accidental exposure of data or from a deliberate attack to steal or alter data;  an unauthorized incident that caused degradation, interruption, loss of control, damage to, or loss of operational technology systems;  an incident in which an unauthorized party accessed, or a party exceeded authorized access, and altered, or has stolen sensitive business information, personally identifiable  5 information, intellectual property, or information that has resulted, or may result, in a loss or liability for the registrant;  an incident in which a malicious actor has offered to sell or has threatened to publicly disclose sensitive company data; or  an incident in which a malicious actor has demanded payment to restore company data that was stolen or altered.11  While these examples provide helpful guidance on whether an incident may be material to the Commission, they may result in over reporting of incidents by registrants due to their substantial subjectivity. If a company is concerned with determining whether a matter is in fact material and the situation fits within one of these examples, the company may decide to report in an abundance of caution. For example, if an employee were to leave a company and in so doing refused to immediately return a company device containing its intellectual property, the company may be forced to make an 8 K disclosure even if the employee eventually agrees to comply with the companys request. An incident such as this may cause investors to act irrationally, thinking that the event is more damaging to the company than it is in actuality, resulting in unnecessary volatility.  D. Mandating the disclosure of policies and procedures may aid the cyber criminals and not benefit investors.  Proposed new Item 106(b) of Regulation S K would require a company to disclose in its Form 10 K, as applicable, whether:  it has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and if so, provide a description of such program;  it engages assessors, consultants, auditors or other third parties in connection with any cybersecurity risk assessment program;  it has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third party service provider (including, but not limited to, those providers that have access to the companys customer and employee data), including whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of these providers and contractual and other mechanisms the company uses to mitigate cybersecurity risks related to these providers;  it undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize the effects of cybersecurity incidents;  it has business continuity, contingency and recovery plans in the event of a cybersecurity incident;  previous cybersecurity incidents have informed changes in its governance, policies and procedures, or technologies;  cybersecurity related risks and incidents have affected or are reasonably likely to affect its results of operations or financial condition and if so, how; and  11 See the Proposal at p.24.   6  cybersecurity risks are considered as part of its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation and if so, how.  Commissioner Peirce pointedly addressed the concerns with this requirement in her dissent: The proposed rules also require companies to disclose their policies and procedures, if they exist, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats. Again, while cloaked as a disclosure requirement, the proposed rules pressure companies to consider adapting their existing policies and procedures to conform to the Commissions preferred approach, embodied in eight specific disclosure items. The enumerated disclosure topics likely make sense for many public companies, but securities regulators are not best suited to design cybersecurity programs to be effective for all companies, in all industries, across time. The proposals detailed disclosure obligations on these topics will have the undeniable effect of incentivizing companies to take specific actions to avoid appearing as if they do not take cybersecurity as seriously as other companies. The substance of how a company manages its cybersecurity risk, however, is best left to the companys management to figure out in view of its specific challenges, subject to the checks and balances provided by the board of directors and shareholders.12 Virtu respectfully submits that a public company should be allowed to contour its cyber program to its business and related vulnerabilities instead of being forced to mechanically address the requirements set by the Commission. Further, requiring registrants to go into the level of detail contemplated by the Proposal could provide a roadmap to cyber criminals on how to expose and take advantage of a company. Again, the policy objectives advanced by the Proposal could have been much more effectively achieved through an update to the 2011 Staff Guidance and 2018 Staff Guidance materials rather than through an overreaching and prescriptive rulemaking. E. The alleged rationale for requiring enhanced disclosures does not justify mandating board composition or other prescriptive governance requirements.  In addition, the Proposal would require disclosure in a companys Form 10 K of information about its cybersecurity governance, including a description of the boards oversight of cybersecurity risks and managements role in assessing and managing cybersecurity related risks and in implementing the companys cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies. Moreover, proposed new paragraph (j) of Item 407 of Regulation S K would require disclosure in annual reports, annual meeting proxy statements, and information statements on Schedule 14C if any member of the companys board of directors has expertise in cybersecurity, including the name(s) of any such director(s) and any detail necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise. The  12 See SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal (March 9, 2022), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922  7 Proposal does not define what constitutes cybersecurity expertise but instead includes a list of criteria (but not an exclusive list) that a company should consider in reaching a determination on whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Although the purported impetus for the Proposal is the Commissions perceived view that companies are not reporting material cyber incidents, there is no corresponding concern articulated by the Commission necessitating drastic governance changes at the board level. The Proposal seeks to unnecessarily impose a requirement of cybersecurity expertise for a board member. A company should have the ability to determine the composition and roles of its board members instead of being artificially directed by a Commission requirement that addresses one risk out of many that a company may face in its operations. Simply put, the Commission should not be permitted to micromanage the governance operations of a public company. * * * While Virtu strongly supports the goals of enhancing transparency and company disclosure, we believe the Proposal is a continuation of the paternalistic trend by the Commission to govern the inner workings of public companies. As noted above, registrants are already required to disclose material cyber incidents. Moreover, the Proposal would mandate the disclosure of information that could harm instead of assist shareholders and investors. For all the foregoing reasons, we request that the Commission convert the Proposal into additional interpretive guidance that could truly aid and assist companies and investing public combat the ever growing cyber threat.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549  Re: Proposed Rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure File Number S7 09 22  Dear Ms. Countryman,  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the Proposed Rules for public companies regarding cybersecurity requirements. We previously submitted comments on the recent proposal related to Advisors, and many of the points we raised in that comment letter are relevant to this Proposed Rule as well. We will be brief in this letter and limit comments to a few items relevant to both proposals we deem of most importance, plus several items introduced in the Proposed Rule for public companies.  The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) is the leading trade association driving public policy and advocacy on behalf of the life insurance industry. 90 million American families rely on the life insurance industry for financial protection and retirement security. ACLIs member companies are dedicated to protecting consumers financial wellbeing through life insurance, annuities, retirement plans, long term care insurance, disability income insurance, reinsurance, and dental, vision and other supplemental benefits. ACLIs 280 member companies represent 95 percent of industry assets in the United States.  Summary  ACLI member companies appreciate the significance of potential negative impacts from cybersecurity incidents. We take with great seriousness our responsibility for safeguarding our systems, and the personal information contained in those systems regarding our customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Life insurance companies work with state insurance regulators to ensure proper disclosure of cybersecurity risk management practices. ACLI is most concerned about the following aspects of the Proposed Rule: alignment and consistency with existing cybersecurity frameworks, the definitions proffered, and the notice requirements, specifically as they relate to materiality and harm.  Appropriate Alignment and Consistency with Existing Frameworks  ACLI members believe that overall, any cybersecurity proposals generated by the SEC should be appropriately aligned and consistent with existing cybersecurity frameworks. Harmonization with existing frameworks will be extremely helpful in reducing unnecessary compliance burdens. Our members would recommend that overall, the policies and procedures proposed should be less prescriptive and allow flexibility to account for the multiple existing cybersecurity frameworks and various regulatory requirements to which organizations are already subjected. We note that some entities are trying to develop holistic programs that meet all their various regulatory requirements, as well as are appropriate for the size and the risks of the entity, and this is made much easier by harmonization and flexibility. Our members would also urge the SEC not to prescribe one cybersecurity framework over another, as that would be unduly burdensome to entities subject to differing requirements.  Specific items that would benefit from alignment include: (1) notice timeframes; (2) the definition of what constitutes an incident, and when it arises to the level of a reporting requirement; (3) specified coordination among regulators, as where a company has notified its primary regulator; and (4) exceptions for law enforcement investigations.  Materiality Threshold  The definition of materiality threshold seems to be inconsistent with other references to materiality within the proposal. Of broader concern, the bar for materiality as it relates to cybersecurity incidents appears to be lower than for other reporting requirements. The examples provided involve very broad scenarios that in our view may or may not be material depending on factors such as the preparedness of the company. Without additional context, the examples serve to, intentionally or not, lower the bar for ascertaining materiality. Cybersecurity incidents are of course important matters, but the same can be said of other items subject to reporting—we would urge the SEC to carefully align materiality and notice requirements with existing definitions and guidance. Notification Requirements  One of our members primary concerns is with the proposed guidelines regarding notification to the Commission. The proposed four day requirement we believe to be overly strict and is inconsistent with other federal and state notification requirements. There also is no extension for law enforcement delay/investigation, which we think is necessary. Moreover, it creates a potential scenario where investors are informed prior to the affected data subjects. Notification of business partners could also occur after notification to the SEC, which is undesirable. We would request a longer notification deadline. Perhaps more important than the duration of the timing itself, is the need to build in some flexibility as to when the clock begins to run. Allowing companies the time to take the appropriate steps to protect consumers and other stakeholders is a critical component of the proposed guidelines. Our members are concerned that a focus on fast reporting takes time away from remediation efforts, and further risk may occur if companies are forced to report before remediation is fully completed. As a final point, it is difficult to envision standardized and comparable disclosures resulting from this brief deadline.   Periodic Reporting of Risk Management Practices  The Proposed Rule would require significant amounts of information to be disclosed regarding an entitys programs. We question whether the potential risk generated by this disclosure, and the level of detail envisioned, will outweigh any potential insights for investors.  Aggregate Reporting  The periodic and aggregate disclosures strike us as problematic. Points/questions we would ask to be considered:  No other data breach reporting requirement exists like this that we are aware of.  How operationally would this be administered by an entity? o Is there a defined period for aggregate consideration? o Is there a defined scope of incidents that should be considered for aggregate?   Does this aggregated concept provide a roadmap for bad actors of an entitys potential vulnerabilities?  Specific Feedback Concerning Section F. Periodic Disclosure by Foreign Private Issuers, questions 38 and 39: o 38. Should we amend Form 20 F, as proposed to require disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy, governance, and incidents? Additionally, should we amend Form 6 K, as proposed, to add cybersecurity incidents as a reporting topic? Are there unique considerations with respect to FPIs in these contexts?  o 39. We are not proposing any changes to Form 40 F. Should we instead require an MJDS issuer filing an annual report on Form 40 F to comply with the Commissions specific proposed cybersecurity related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10 K or Form 20 F filers?  MJDS filers are already subject to significant regulatory obligations from their securities regulator and industry specific regulator. We urge the SEC to continue to permit eligible Canadian foreign private issuers to use domestic disclosure standards and documents to satisfy the Commissions requirements and not enact prescriptive cybersecurity disclosure requirements onto Form 40 F filers. Not doing so, would create a significant reporting burden that will slow companies response to cybersecurity incidents and increase regulatory burden on filers, without necessarily improving upon existing domestic regulatory requirements to develop sound cybersecurity risk management practices.  Conclusion  ACLI Member companies continue to digest the impact of this Proposed Rule, as well as the cybersecurity rules proposed for advisors. Our members welcome the opportunity to continue with a discussion to make sure that the operations of our members are fully considered. Very truly yours, Patrick C.

Countryman, Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549 1090 RE: File No. S7 09 22: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Submitted By: Joshua Mitts* Dear Secretary Countryman: The Commission should be commended for a thoughtful and comprehensive proposal to cybersecurity incident reporting. The Commissions proposed rule, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (the proposal),1 will protect investors by reducing information asymmetry and enhancing share price accuracy in the capital markets. This letter applauds the Commissions attention to academic scholarship on informed cybertrading and respectfully raises a few specific comments the Commission may wish to consider before finalizing the proposal.  As the Commission recognizes, current reporting of cybersecurity risks is critical because mispricing resulting from delayed or incomplete cybersecurity incident disclosure can be dangerously exploited by informed cybertraders.2 The implications of informed cybersecurity trading are distinct from garden variety information trading in securities markets.3 Typically, new information is merely observed by an information trader; in informed cyber trading, the new information may be substantially created and imposed on a firm by the same actors who cause a cybersecurity breach, or those acting in concert with them.4 Those actors may trade ahead of disclosure of a cybersecurity breach they caused.5 Allowing parties to capture profits generated from this type of trading, therefore, incentivizes cybertraders to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities in order to reap arbitrage gains following disclosure of a hack.6  Such information arbitrage opportunities catalyze destructive activity for the purpose of trading on the basis of the harm it creates  leading to greater dissemination of stolen personal information, impersonation, and identity theft.7 Because insider trading in connection with cybersecurity breaches presents economic costs largely absent in garden variety information trading, enhanced legal scrutiny of those who profit from the activity is plausibly justified.8 Yet, informed cybertraders are unlikely to face any liability under current law.9 As the Commission rightly identifies, it is therefore vital to ensure effective  *Associate Professor of Law and Milton Handler Fellow, Columbia Law School.

Before finalizing the proposal, the Commission may wish to consider the following comments to further strengthen the deterrent effect of the proposal on trading on material, nonpublic cybersecurity information. First, the Commission may consider prohibiting insider trading during the period of time after a firms materiality determination but before disclosure through a public filing. Imposing a blackout period during the disclosure window would encourage firms to file 8 K reports quickly but preserve firms ability to wait to make materiality determinations until they are able to provide accurate disclosures.  Alternatively, the Commission may consider shortening or eliminating the four business day filing period for 8 K reports triggered by cybersecurity incidents. The problem of sanctioning delay before disclosing material events to investors is well recognized.11 The most compelling justification for preserving a four day gap between the occurrence of a material corporate event and the Form 8 K filing deadline is that it takes time for companies to make a determination of materiality and prepare precise information. However compelling that justification may be, it should not apply to firms reporting obligations under Item 1.05. Under the proposal, a firms disclosure obligation would arise only when a cybersecurity incident is determined by a registrant to be material.12 Therefore, if a firm determines it needs additional time to prepare a disclosure, it could simply delay making a determination of materiality.  Second, the Commission may also wish to reconsider its inclusion of Item 1.05 as one of the Form 8 K items eligible for the safe harbor exemption from liability under Exchange Act 10(b) and Rule 10b 5.  The stated justification for the safe harbor  that it is appropriate if the triggering event for the Form 8 K requires management to make a rapid materiality determination13  is not as compelling for cybersecurity incident reporting. The Commissions proposal requires registrants to make materiality determinations only as soon as is reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident.14 Registrants, therefore, need not make rapid materiality determinations to comply with the Commissions proposal, and shielding companies from potential liability stemming from reporting failures may weaken the effect of the proposal.  Finally, the Commission may wish to require that there be a reasonable basis for a firms materiality determination to allow for ex post inquiry not only into the reasonableness of the timing of a firms materiality determination but also into the reasonableness of the factual basis for the determination.

Guinan Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  May 9, 2022  Via Electronic Mail (rule comments@sec.gov) U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street, NE  Washington, DC 20549 1090 Attention: Ms. Vanessa Countryman, Secretary Re: File No. S7 09 22 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529  Dear Ms. Countryman: Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (Quest Diagnostics) appreciates the opportunity to submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) its views on the rules proposed in the above captioned release in respect of disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting (the Proposed Rules).  Quest Diagnostics is the worlds leading provider of diagnostic information services. Our diagnostic information services business provides information and insights based on our industry leading menu of routine, non routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services. Our diagnostic solutions businesses are the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry and offer healthcare organizations and clinicians robust information technology solutions.  We appreciate the Commissions attention to the increasing risks to public companies posed by cybersecurity threats and its efforts to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and cybersecurity incident reporting to better inform investors. While we support certain of the amendments included in the Proposed Rules, we have concerns regarding the cybersecurity incident reporting requirements as formulated under the Proposed Rules. In particular, we believe the cybersecurity incident reporting requirements, as proposed, will serve only to benefit parties other than investors. The scope and timing of the proposed  2  incident reporting could potentially force companies to prematurely disclose incomplete information, which would confuse investors and negatively impact a companys stock price with hastily disclosed information. The rush to disclose information that is evident in the Proposed Rules would likely end up interfering with the ability of companies to respond to ongoing cybersecurity incidents, including hindering remediation efforts. Importantly, the primary benefactor of the information that would be disclosed in connection with the proposed incident reporting requirements may be the bad actors that are initiating these attacks and even the bad actor who initiated the very attack that is subject of the premature disclosure.  Specifically, we believe that imposing an affirmative obligation to report material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K within four business days of a materiality determination would result in premature disclosure that would hinder the ability of public companies to stop, investigate, remediate and defend against cybersecurity incidents. While we recognize that cybersecurity events can be material and investors should be appropriately informed of instances of these types of events, we do not think a material cybersecurity event should trigger an immediate disclosure obligation. Although Form 8 K has identified certain events that trigger current reporting, Form 8 K is not designed to encompass all material events that a company could experience. For example, there is no Form 8 K triggering event if a company determines that its financial results for a period will not meet its publicly disclosed financial guidance. There could be many instances where the disclosure of a small miss on stated guidance would have an immediate stock price impact that would be far greater than any disclosure related to the occurrence of a material cybersecurity event. The securities laws do not impose an affirmative duty to disclose material information on a current basis and the Proposed Rules are not directed at updating information that was misleading when it was initially disclosed. The Proposed Rules are seeking to impose unique treatment for a specific type of information without consideration of the challenges and pressures a company faces in preparing these types of disclosures and the ability of investors and the market to absorb the information delivered prematurely.  Accordingly, we are recommending that the Commission should not adopt proposed new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. If the Commission determines that it is important to require an affirmative obligation for public companies to report material cybersecurity incidents, we suggest that, as an alternative, the Commission adopt a different incident reporting disclosure regime, which we believe would allow companies to provide more accurate, comprehensive and actionable disclosures to investors about material cybersecurity incidents, while preserving the Commissions goal of having public companies provide investors with consistent cybersecurity incident disclosures that are comparable across industries. Outlined below are our comments on the Proposed Rules.  Proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K  The Proposed Rules mandate, under a new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K, certain cybersecurity incident disclosures within four business days after a registrant determines that an incident is material, which materiality determination must be made as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident in accordance with Instruction 1 to Item 1.05. In particular, a registrant would be required to disclose the following information about a material cybersecurity incident  3  to the extent known at the time of filing: when the incident was discovered and whether it is ongoing; a brief description of the nature and scope of the incident; whether any data was stolen, altered, accessed or used for any other unauthorized purpose; the effect of the incident on the registrants operations; and whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. Material changes, additions or updates in the relevant period, if any, to information previously disclosed under new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K would be required to be included in a companys quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and annual reports on Form 10 K, as applicable, and potentially even in an amended Form 8 K. Interference with Ability to Investigate Cybersecurity Incident  Investigating the nature, impact and costs of cybersecurity incidents can often be a highly complex, specialized and time consuming process, particularly given the increasing frequency and the rapidly evolving sophistication and intensity of cyberattacks in recent years. We believe that, in many instances, under the Proposed Rules, a company would have insufficient time to gather enough information to determine whether a known cybersecurity event is material. Moreover, even if a company believes that a cybersecurity event is material, four business days is insufficient for companies to conduct the necessary investigations to collect the information required by Item 1.05, particularly given the need to engage with internal and external experts. This timeframe seeks to rush out disclosures related to cybersecurity matters without taking into account the circumstances surrounding, and the magnitude and complexity of, any given cybersecurity incident. Under proposed Item 1.05, we believe companies will be under intense pressure to quickly make a determination regarding whether a known cybersecurity event is material.  Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1.05 reinforces the pressure that this new obligation will place on companies by requiring a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. As a result, it is likely that a company will feel compelled, within a four business day window, to either hastily conclude that a known cybersecurity event is material or disclose the existence of a cybersecurity event, even if it does not know whether it is material, for fear of being seconded guessed when more information becomes available. Stockholders, regulators and plaintiffs law firms, with the benefit of time, less pressure and the full landscape of information and impact, may seek to challenge the determinations made by management in the heat of an ongoing cybersecurity event where the information is incomplete and unverified. These parties will ask the simple question, informed by hindsight: How could you not think it was not material? The proposed reporting regime will cause companies to make disclosures related to cybersecurity events that are incomplete. To meet the proposed four business day deadline, companies will likely make disclosures that are required by proposed Item 1.05 and indicate that the company has not been able to conclude whether the cybersecurity event is material. As a result, a Form 8 K filing, at this stage, will do more to confuse investors than to inform them. The market reaction to a premature disclosure of a cybersecurity event could be significant. The  4  lack of clarity and the absence of a clear assessment on materiality in a Form 8 K filing will lead to speculation.  Interference with Company Response and Law Enforcement Furthermore, as the Proposed Rules do not distinguish between ongoing and past cybersecurity incidents, in the case of an active incident, a premature filing of a Form 8 K could provide a malicious actor with valuable intelligence on the current vulnerabilities in the companys systems and the companys ability to defend against a cyberattack, and as a result exacerbate the severity of the incident or hinder its remediation. For example, in the case of a ransomware attack, the ability to negotiate and thwart an attacker could be compromised by a premature disclosure of the existence of the attack. Disclosure should not be required at a time when a company believes that disclosure would interfere with its response to an incident.  We are also concerned with the proposed sequencing of the cybersecurity incident reporting requirement. The Proposed Rules provide that companies would be required to first file a Form 8 K reporting the material cybersecurity incident pursuant to Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and to subsequently update such information on a quarterly basis in a companys Form 10 Q and Form 10 K, as applicable, pursuant to Item 106(d). The Commission has also indicated that, notwithstanding Item 106(d), there may be situations that would require amending the Form 8 K reporting the material cybersecurity incident as a result of subsequent developments regarding the incident. As described above, information regarding cybersecurity incidents often becomes available to companies incrementally and incompletely. Requiring that a company determine whether an amendment is required as a result of a subsequent development would subject the company to the same struggle of assessing when this disclosure should be made and what it should include while avoiding further investor confusion. In addition, we are also concerned that proposed Item 1.05 does not permit disclosure to be delayed when law enforcement determines that public disclosure would impede a civil or criminal investigation. As the Commission notes in its release, certain jurisdictions have laws that allow companies to delay providing public notice about a data breach incident or notifying certain constituencies of such an incident if law enforcement determines that notification will impede a civil or criminal investigation. By implementing Item 1.05 of Form 8 K, disclosures may be required on Form 8 K even where disclosure would hinder an active civil or criminal investigation on the basis that such disclosures are critical to investor protection and well functioning, orderly, and efficient markets. We disagree with this premise and do not believe Form 8 K should impose an affirmative reporting obligation where disclosure would hinder law enforcement in its investigation and identification of the actors behind a particular incident, not least because doing so would do nothing to prevent future cybersecurity incidents and may even make them more likely. As described above, we appreciate the Commissions attention to the increasing risks posed by cybersecurity threats and acknowledge that information about such threats may be relevant to investors and other market participants by enabling them to assess the potential effect of a material cybersecurity incident on a particular registrant. We believe that the existing reporting regime sufficiently facilitates such disclosures—companies already choose to report cybersecurity incidents under Item 8.01 of Form 8 K and may do so without the imposition of  5  time constraints that could result in incomplete disclosure or impede responding to the incident or law enforcement investigations. While the existing regime does not impose an affirmative obligation to report a material cybersecurity incident, neither does it impose an affirmative obligation on a company to disclose a whole range of information that is material. The foundation of the existing reporting regime does not allow a company to omit material information when communicating with the market, which we believe maintains the investor protection and market efficiency that the Commission seeks. Because of the complexity of cybersecurity incidents and negative consequences of premature reporting thereof, we do not believe an affirmative obligation to report material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K within four business days is appropriate, and we believe that the Commission should not adopt proposed new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. Alternative Proposal for Cybersecurity Disclosures If the Commission determines that it is important to require an affirmative obligation for public companies to report material cybersecurity incidents, we suggest that, as an alternative to the new Item 1.05 to Form 8 K, the Commission propose modifying the new Item 106(d) applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and annual reports on Form 10 K to include the Item 1.05 disclosures, rather than implementing new Item 106(d) only for purposes of updated incident disclosure as contemplated under the Proposed Rules. Under this alternative proposal, registrants would be required to disclose, to the extent known at the time of filing, information with respect to any material cybersecurity incidents that took place during the period covered by the quarterly or annual report, as applicable, and provide material changes, additions or updates in the relevant period, if any, to previous material cybersecurity incident disclosures as currently set forth in Item 106(d). To the extent available, companies would also be able, but not required, to disclose information regarding material cybersecurity incidents that occurred between the end of the reporting period and the date of filing of the Form 10 K or Form 10 Q, as applicable. Under this approach, Item 106(d) should be modified also so that a company would be permitted to delay reporting to the next quarterly or annual report, as applicable, to avoid interference with a companys response to the incident or law enforcement investigation. Despite this exemption, companies would continue to be able to use Form 8 K or periodic reports to report information regarding cybersecurity incidents under appropriate circumstances.  We note that this suggested approach is consistent with legal proceedings disclosures under Item 103, which are required, if applicable, on a quarterly basis in quarterly and annual reports. Assessing materiality and gathering relevant information with respect to pending legal proceedings can often be time consuming, and premature disclosure of such proceedings may hinder, rather than aid, investors in understanding the proceedings. Similar to Item 103, under the suggested approach, companies would be required to provide material updates in the relevant period to a previously disclosed material cybersecurity incident to inform investors of incident developments as facts evolve.  We believe such an alternative will provide companies more time to investigate cybersecurity incidents and uncover information regarding material cybersecurity incidents, thereby allowing companies to evaluate and assess their nature, scope, and impact on financial 6 conditions and operations in a more comprehensive manner. We believe that the suggested alternative also would reduce the negative consequences, outlined above, of mandating reporting on Form 8 K. While we acknowledge, as the Commission notes, that this would lead to less timely reporting on material cybersecurity incidents on the whole, we believe the benefits of this approach, which include more complete disclosures, decreased likelihood of malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities resulting from the material cybersecurity incident and interference with a civil or criminal investigation and reduced compliance costs for companies, far outweigh this consideration and will allow for disclosures that are more useful to investors and other market participants and more digestible by the markets. We also believe this proposal provides a uniform standard of disclosure so investors and other stakeholders will be able to locate and compare disclosures across all public companies in a consistent manner.  We appreciate the opportunity to express our views and concerns regarding the Proposed Rules. If there are questions regarding any of our comments, we would welcome an opportunity for further discussion. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 973 520 2700. Sincerely, Mark J.

Manufacturing is a capital intensive industry, requiring significant investments for equipment purchases and research and development. Manufacturers often turn to the public capital markets to finance these pro growth activities, which set the stage for economic expansion, innovation, and job creation. Thus, a vibrant public market that supports capital formation and long term growth is critical to the sustained success of manufacturing in America.  Manufacturers of all sizes and in all sectors know that protecting their business—and thus the investors that provide much needed capital to support manufacturing growth in the United States— from cybersecurity risk is critical for success in todays economy. Through comprehensive and connected relationships with customers, vendors, suppliers, and governments, manufacturers maintain highly sensitive data and valuable intellectual property. The responsibility of securing information, networks, facilities, and machinery that support manufacturing is a top priority for our sector. Further, manufacturers know that disclosing material information about these important practices is vital to informing and protecting shareholders in publicly traded companies.  The NAM appreciates that the SECs proposed rule is designed to elevate the importance of cybersecurity risk management at public companies. Shareholders in all businesses benefit when public companies take appropriate steps to guard against cybersecurity risk. Cyber criminals, nation state attackers, and other hackers continue to employ increasingly sophisticated methods to infiltrate and attack businesses and steal data, and manufacturers are leading the way in continuing to evolve their defenses in response to these threats. The NAM recognizes and appreciates the importance of adopting these critical cybersecurity practices and of reporting material information about cybersecurity risk management and cybersecurity incidents to investors.  However, we are concerned that some of the requirements in the proposed rule could be needlessly burdensome and duplicative for public companies given the existing layers of federal cybersecurity  1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590 (23 March 2022). Release Nos. 33 11038, 34 94382, IC 34529; available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR 2022 03 23/pdf/2022 05480.pdf.  2 reporting already in existence. Further, some of the proposed disclosures could ultimately endanger shareholder value by publicly exposing sensitive information, including to the bad actors that threaten companies cybersecurity on a daily basis. The SECs proposed disclosure regime is a departure compared to other agencies cybersecurity reporting requirements in that the reports would be publicly available. In most situations, public reporting fits squarely within the SECs mission to protect investors via material disclosures; however, in the cybersecurity context such reporting brings additional risks for those same investors. If the SECs disclosure mandate exposes sensitive information about a companys cybersecurity protections, reveals data about what types of attacks are successful, interferes with a law enforcement investigation into a cybersecurity incident, distracts a company from responding to an ongoing threat, or endangers the national security of the United States, do investors ultimately benefit from the disclosure? Premature public disclosure of sensitive information about an incident or a vulnerability contradicts well established best practices for cybersecurity because such disclosure can enable attackers at a time when a company is potentially at its most vulnerable. As such, the NAM is hopeful that any final SEC rule will provide companies with the flexibility to balance the need for prompt reporting against the risks inherent in exposing sensitive cybersecurity information to the public.  As the SEC works to finalize its proposed rule on cybersecurity disclosures, the NAM respectfully encourages the Commission to take steps to balance the risks and benefits of any new reporting requirements. We also urge the SEC to collaborate with other federal agencies with cybersecurity expertise in order to ensure that the governments cybersecurity reporting obligations align to the largest extent possible—and so that the SEC is fully aware of the impacts that a public reporting requirement could have on companies cybersecurity defenses and the United States national security. Appropriate flexibility will allow manufacturers to protect themselves against cybersecurity risks, provide timely and accurate cybersecurity disclosures to their investors, and safeguard sensitive information.  I. The SEC should incorporate the principles based approach outlined in its 2018 guidance into any new cybersecurity reporting requirements.  In 2018, the SEC promulgated interpretative guidance related to public company cybersecurity disclosures.2 At the time, the Commission underscored the increasing significance of cybersecurity incidents3 and stresse[d] the importance of maintaining comprehensive policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risks and incidents.4 The NAM strongly agreed, and continues to agree, with this assessment. The 2018 guidance also noted that it is critical that public companies take all required actions to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks and incidents in a timely fashion.5 Specifically, the guidance reminds public companies of their obligation to provide timely and ongoing information in [Forms 10 K and 10 Q] periodic reports regarding material cybersecurity risk and incidents6 and encourages issuers to use Form 8 K current reports to ensure that information about material cybersecurity incidents is disclosed promptly.7 Again, the NAM supports and agrees with these standards.  2 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 83 Fed. Reg. 8166 (26 February 2018). Release Nos. 33 10459, 34 82746; available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR 2018 02 26/pdf/2018 03858.pdf.  3 Id. at 8167.  4 Ibid.  5 Ibid.  6 Id. at 8168.  7 Ibid. 3  In its 2018 guidance, the Commission outlined reasonable principles for disclosure and reminded public companies of their legal obligations to keep investors well informed about cybersecurity risks and incidents. Given public companies ongoing usage of and reliance on the 2018 guidance, it is not immediately clear why a new cybersecurity disclosures rule is necessary. Although the cybersecurity threat landscape has continued to evolve and change since 2018, the guidances principles based approach was designed to account for just such an evolution. The NAM is concerned that the SEC has proposed a significantly more prescriptive approach than the one described as requiring companies to establish robust disclosure controls and procedures8 by the Commission just four years ago. The NAM supports these robust controls and procedures—and manufacturers critical efforts to combat cybersecurity threats while providing timely and accurate cybersecurity disclosures to their investors.  The 2018 guidance repeatedly underscores the requirement that public companies keep investors informed about cybersecurity risks and material cybersecurity incidents. The guidance suggests specific practices for appropriate cybersecurity reporting—without mandating detailed line item disclosures or instituting hard deadlines for companies to meet. The NAM believes the approach outlined in the 2018 guidance is sufficient to inform investors about and protect investors from cybersecurity risk. As the SEC works to finalize its proposed rule, we respectfully encourage the Commission to incorporate the guidances principles based approach into any new cybersecurity reporting requirements and to avoid one size fits all mandates that may do more harm than good.  II. The SEC should coordinate with (and, as appropriate, defer to) federal law enforcement, cybersecurity, intelligence, and national security agencies as it works to finalize its proposed cybersecurity rule.  The SEC is not the first federal agency to promulgate cybersecurity reporting requirements. For example, surface transportation operators are subject to a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Security Directive that requires reporting cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).9 Defense contractors face similar requirements to notify the Department of Defense (DOD) after discovering a cybersecurity breach.10 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains a cybersecurity framework to help companies understand and manage their cybersecurity risk.11 Most recently, Congress enacted the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which will require owners and operators of critical infrastructure—including many manufacturers—to provide cybersecurity incident reports to CISA.12  These reporting requirements differ from the SECs proposed rule in several key ways. First and foremost, the reports submitted pursuant to these frameworks are confidential. They are designed to inform the relevant agency so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to an ongoing breach or guard against future attacks. They do not suggest publicly sharing information about cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The SECs incident reporting proposal, on the other hand, would mandate public disclosure of details about material cybersecurity incidents. While the NAM supports public 8 Id. at 8167.  9 Enhancing Surface Transportation Cybersecurity. Transportation Security Administration (31 December 2021). Available at https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/20211201_surface ic 2021 01.pdf.  10 32 CFR 236.4.  11 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. National Institute of Standards and Technology (16 April 2018). Available at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf. 12 See Division Y, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. P.L. 117 103.  4 disclosure of material information, it is still the case that public disclosures present significantly increased burdens and risks as compared to agency notifications—including the costs and legal liability associated with SEC filings and the potential dangers of exposing sensitive information to hackers. As such, the SEC should coordinate with its sister agencies and provide flexibility to companies in order to ensure that any required public reports do not expose businesses, investors, or the United States to increased cybersecurity risks. The NAM is concerned that the proposed rules lack of flexibility and coordination could interfere with critical law enforcement investigations into cyber criminals and could be detrimental to the United States national security.  Additionally, it is notable that the agencies overseeing the existing cybersecurity reporting frameworks have both the expertise and the statutory mandate to protect Americans and American businesses from harm. Given the wealth of expertise across the federal government on this critical issue, and the web of overlapping agency notification requirements to which businesses are already subject, the NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to closely coordinate with other federal agencies as it works to promulgate its own cybersecurity reporting requirement. In particular, the NAM is hopeful that the SEC will defer to CISA during the implementation of the new CIRCIA notification regime. The NAM has called for CISA to provide a reasonable and flexible reporting deadline that allows manufacturers to respond to emerging information and other factors when providing the required incident notifications.13 CISA has two years to promulgate implementing regulations, and the NAM is concerned that the SECs more expedited timeline for its cybersecurity rule could result in divergent reporting requirements. Unfortunately, the SECs expedited consideration of its proposed disclosure regime indicates that the first rule to be finalized likely will not be from the federal governments cybersecurity agency. In addition to working with and deferring to CISA during the implementation of CIRCIA, the NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as to the impact of public disclosure on law enforcement investigations into cybersecurity incidents. We also encourage the Commission to engage with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of State, DOD, and DHS to understand the national security implications of the SECs proposed rule. The NAM believes that these agencies expertise and experience are critical to the success of any final SEC cybersecurity reporting rule.  III. The SEC should allow for greater flexibility with respect to the proposed four day reporting requirement for cybersecurity incidents in order to prevent harm businesses, shareholders, and national security.  The proposed rule would require public disclosure within four days of a public company determining that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Under the rule, companies would be required to file a Form 8 K to describe the incident, report when it was discovered and whether it is ongoing, explain any effects on the companys operations, and provide additional information about the event and its impact. The NAM supports appropriate and timely disclosure of material incidents, but the proposed four day requirement would increase costs and complexity for businesses, potentially mislead investors, and ultimately create significant risks for shareholders and the broader economy that would eclipse the potential benefits of reporting. We respectfully encourage the SEC to re evaluate the proposed rules one size fits all four day reporting requirement; at a minimum, the SEC should allow for reporting to occur after a company has had a reasonable opportunity to respond to and resolve an incident.  13 NAM Letter on S. 2875 (5 October 2021). Available at https://www.nam.org/wp content/uploads/2021/10/NAMSenateSHSGACLtrS.2875.pdf.  5 A. The NAM appreciates that the proposed incident reporting framework would require disclosure only of material cybersecurity events and would start the disclosure clock for incident reports following the completion of a companys materiality determination.  1. The SEC should maintain its proposed requirement that companies disclose only material cybersecurity events. The NAM appreciates that the proposed rule would require disclosure only of material cybersecurity incidents. In todays interconnected economy, cybersecurity attacks are far too common. Public companies must be prepared for a constant barrage of phishing attempts and potential minor intrusions. Yet these smaller attacks—both on their own and in the aggregate—are immaterial to a companys operations and financial condition. It would make little sense to require repetitive disclosures of inconsequential incidents that pose minimal risk to a business and its investors. As such, the NAM appreciates that the proposed rules incident reporting obligations are targeted at only those incidents that are material to a company.  Further, the NAM appreciates that companies would retain the ability to classify an incident as material based on the well understood definition of materiality expressed by the Supreme Court.14 Bright line materiality tests or SEC mandated determinations that certain sizes or types of incidents would be per se material would oversimplify a complex issue and ultimately impose significant burdens on companies by requiring disclosure of incidents that may not be material to investors.15  Put simply, different sizes and types of incidents will impact companies in distinct ways, so it would be inappropriate for the SEC to promulgate a top down standard that applies to all businesses and all areas of the economy. Issuers materiality assessments will incorporate data on the size, scale, and scope of a particular incident alongside information about the business itself and the industry in which it operates, including the companys cybersecurity risk exposure, its relationships with customers, suppliers, and vendors, and its governance and risk management practices and procedures. The SEC should continue to allow companies the flexibility to incorporate these and other variables into the materiality analyses envisaged by the proposed rule rather than attempting to dictate a uniform definition of materiality.  2. The SEC should continue to base any reporting deadlines on the completion of a companys materiality assessment.  The proposing release solicits comment on whether there should be a different triggering event (as opposed to the completion of a companys materiality assessment) that would set the reporting deadline for the required incident disclosures. The release suggests that such a trigger could be a companys discovery of an incident about which it has not yet made a materiality assessment.16 The NAM strongly supports the proposed reporting trigger (i.e., an issuers determination that a given cybersecurity incident was material) and would oppose any changes that would set accelerated reporting deadlines based on the occurrence or discovery of an incident. Starting the disclosure clock based on any event other than a materiality determination could lead to costly and potentially risky disclosure obligations following even the most inconsequential of incidents. 14 See, e.g., TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976); see also Basic, Inc. vs. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988).  15 The proposing release solicits comment on whether the SEC should mandate disclosure based on a quantifiable threshold related to a companys assets, equity, revenues, or net income (see Proposed Rule, supra note 1, at 16597). The NAM would oppose such a bright line test.  16 Proposed Rule, supra note 1, at 16597.  6  Further, materiality analyses are often complicated and will take time to conduct, especially while a company is working to investigate, understand, respond to, and mitigate the impact of an incident. It would make little sense to force a rushed materiality assessment in the immediate hours after discovery of an attack by requiring disclosure four days after such a discovery. Investors will be much better served by the SECs proposal to allow companies the necessary time to understand an incident and conduct a full and fair materiality assessment—and then to start the reporting clock that will ultimately result in Form 8 K filings about incidents determined to be material. The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to maintain its proposed triggering event and to continue to emphasize the importance of company materiality assessments under any final rule. B. The proposed four day reporting requirement would divert company resources from responding to an incident, result in potentially misleading disclosures for investors, and benefit bad actors.  Even assuming that the SEC maintains its proposed reporting trigger of a companys determination that an incident is material (rather than the discovery of the incident or its occurrence), the NAM is concerned that the proposed four day reporting deadline could prove burdensome for public companies and, more importantly, could expose shareholders and the broader economy to risks that far outweigh any benefit of enhanced cybersecurity disclosure. The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to reconsider its proposed one size fits all four day reporting deadline and instead look to provide more flexibility for companies to balance the benefits of timely reporting against the risks of premature disclosure.  The early days after discovery of a major cybersecurity incident are often characterized by confusion, incomplete data, and an all hands on deck effort to investigate and respond to the threat. In some instances, the incursion or intrusion has not yet been contained—a process that can sometimes take weeks or months. Requiring a new, public report during this critical time would divert internal resources from responding to an attack; it could also result in misleading disclosures for shareholders or provide critical information to the perpetrators of the attack.  1. Reporting within four days would impose significant burdens on public companies and hamper efforts to investigate and respond to an incident.  Upon discovering a cybersecurity incident, a company must assess the significance of the event, identify the systems within the business that may have been compromised, and analyze the impact on its operations, customers, financial performance, and more. Companies may also work with law enforcement to determine the source of the attack and whether there are potential future vulnerabilities that the attack has exposed. In many instances, the attack will still be ongoing or its impacts will still be felt throughout this initial period of investigation and evaluation, so it is critical for the company to focus its resources on protecting the business as well as its customers, shareholders, and other partners (such as suppliers and vendors) during this time. For major attacks, it may be clear relatively early that the incident is material—which, under the SECs proposed rule, would begin the four day clock counting down to the incident reporting deadline. The NAM is concerned that diverting time and resources away from understanding and responding to an incident and instead toward preparing an SEC filing would not be in the best interests of the shareholders the proposed rule is designed to protect. While timely disclosure about material incidents is important, an arbitrary four day mandate could potentially harm shareholders by diverting resources from efforts to address the impact of an attack. These all hands on deck mitigation efforts involve cybersecurity, risk management, IT, operations, management, and legal staff—in short, the exact individuals necessary to prepare an SEC filing about the incident. The NAM believes that investors would be better served if company staff and leadership and any external 7 consultants could focus solely on responding to an incident without needing to take time to produce an SEC filing based on an arbitrary deadline.  2. Premature incident reports could mislead investors in the early days following an attack.  In addition to distracting issuers from responding appropriately to cybersecurity threats, a four day incident reporting requirement could also result in potentially misleading disclosures for investors. The information available about an ongoing incident evolves rapidly in the early days after its discovery. The four day reporting deadline would require disclosure of a companys perspective on an attack after 96 hours—even if its understanding of the incident is changing rapidly at the time the report is due (and would likely continue to evolve going forward). As such, the Form 8 K could potentially overstate or understate the risk posed by an incident given that companies may still be assessing the reach and impact of an attack in its early days. Investors making decisions to sell or short a stock based on overstated day four risks, or decisions to buy or hold a stock based on understated risks, would benefit from a company waiting to report an incident until it is comfortable that all relevant facts are available—flexibility which should be allowed under any final rule. Though the proposed rule allows for updates following a Form 8 K filing, these updates may not benefit investors who relied on the initial filing, and any updates would further divert resources from addressing the effects of an attack and restoring operations to their normal state.  In addition to potentially harming shareholders, the uncertainty inherent in making public filings on day four of an ongoing incident could also create significant litigation or reputational risks for companies. If reported information is incomplete or unclear (despite companies best efforts to provide accurate disclosures), market participants may allege that the Form 8 K was materially misleading and pursue legal action. As such, if the SEC persists in mandating a four day disclosure window, it should allow companies incident reports to be furnished to rather than filed with the Commission. The proposing release solicits comment on whether incident disclosures could be furnished;17 such a modification would at least reduce the legal liability for businesses, an impactful change given the uncertainty associated with making public reports in the heart of an evolving crisis. The NAM would also support a safe harbor for disclosures made in reasonable reliance on information provided by third parties. Of course, furnished disclosures and a third party safe harbor would not alleviate the time and resources necessary to prepare a report during an ongoing incident, nor would they prevent bad actors from utilizing any reported information for nefarious purposes— but the reduced legal liability would at least mitigate one risk factor associated with the proposed rule.  3. The proposed definition of information systems would require disclosure of a wide range of incidents involving third party systems about which a company may have incomplete or inadequate information.  The proposed rule defines a cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrants information systems.18 Information systems, in turn, are defined as information resources owned or used by the registrant.19 The NAM believes this definition could create compliance difficulties given that a company may use many systems to process its data, including third party vendor systems such as software as a service, platform as a service, or infrastructure as a service offerings over which the company has no operational control.  17 Id. at 16598.  18 Id. at 16601.  19 Ibid. 8 Companies often must rely on these vendors to inform them of the details of cybersecurity incidents impacting the vendors systems. Under such circumstances, manufacturers may experience challenges in obtaining sufficient information from the vendors to make an informed materiality determination. Vendors may even be hesitant to promptly share detailed incident information due to liability or confidentiality concerns. This lack of information availability increases the risk that an issuer may be forced to rush to make a materiality determination based on limited information. The NAM believes it would be more appropriate for the definition of information systems to include just those resources that are owned or operated by a company (as opposed to owned or used). Such a clarification would make it more likely that companies would be able to obtain relevant and useful information about an incident in a timely manner in order to conduct the required materiality assessment and file the required incident report.  4. Requiring public reporting while an incident is ongoing could provide damaging information to the perpetrators of the attack and to other hackers. In addition to resource diversion and the potential for misleading disclosures, the most critical danger of an arbitrary four day public reporting deadline is that the perpetrators of an attack will be able to read a companys disclosures alongside the rest of the public. Even the notice that a company has discovered an incident could be sufficient for a hacker to change tactics, either to escalate an ongoing attack against the company filing the SEC mandated reports or to modify a strategy in another attack. Though the proposed rule notes that companies would not be required to disclose technical information about an attack, there is nevertheless still a risk that hackers could utilize any information reported to their advantage—and thus to the detriment of the company and its shareholders. Caution is warranted in the days immediately following discovery of an incident (especially when the incident is still ongoing), yet the proposed rules four day clock does not allow for any flexibility or reporting delay—even when it might be beneficial to the company, its investors, and the broader marketplace. For example, a common practice in the event of an incident related to a service provider is to notify the provider first, in confidence, so they can patch the vulnerability for their other clients. But under the proposed rule, companies would not be allowed to delay their Form 8 K to wait on the patch, potentially exposing the broader economy to a much higher degree of risk by allowing hackers to stay one step ahead of any mitigation efforts. The public nature of these disclosures (as compared to the confidential filings that companies are required to make to CISA and other agencies) means that investors and hackers will be notified of any ongoing incidents at the exact same time. Early notifications to CISA or DOD can enable those agencies to assist with mitigating an ongoing incident—whereas early disclosures to the public (including the hackers perpetrating the incident) could have the opposite effect, ultimately increasing risks to investors. C. The SEC should abandon its proposed four day reporting regime in favor of a flexible reporting requirement that enables timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents.  Given the risks to shareholders posed by a four day disclosure requirement, the NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to allow for greater flexibility with respect to the reporting deadline for material cybersecurity incidents. The public nature of any SEC mandated disclosures combined with the short reporting window could make the proposed rules incident reporting requirement difficult and dangerous—but targeted amendments to the proposal can meet the SECs stated goals while still protecting investors.  9 In 2018, the SEC made clear that companies should use Form 8 K to disclose material information about cybersecurity information promptly20 and emphasized the importance of accurate and timely disclosure of material events.21 The NAM believes that a standard based on accurate and timely reporting would be sufficient to protect investors—while substantially mitigating the risks to investors posed by premature public disclosure. Perhaps the SEC could provide guidance as to factors that companies should consider in evaluating the timeliness of their reports, or suggest best practices to encourage appropriately prompt disclosures. Such advice could ease compliance for businesses and ensure that investors are receiving material information about cybersecurity incidents within an appropriate timeframe. But the NAM does not believe that a one size fits all four day reporting requirement is necessary or reasonable. Companies need flexibility to appropriately balance shareholders need for prompt disclosure with their need to be protected from ongoing and future attacks. A principles based requirement that emphasizes the importance of timely disclosure without imposing a top down mandate based on a specific number of days would more accurately reflect the evolving nature of cybersecurity risk and of individual cybersecurity incidents. The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to reconsider its proposed four day incident reporting mandate and instead to institute a principles based requirement that provides information to shareholders on a timely basis while still allowing companies the requisite flexibility to protect investors from the significant risks of premature disclosure.  D. The SEC should allow companies to delay incident reports if premature disclosure would interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or otherwise impact public safety.  Companies do not respond to cybersecurity incidents in isolation. In many cases—especially significant breaches that would necessitate Form 8 K disclosure—businesses work closely with law enforcement to investigate an incident. Local, state, and federal authorities are critical to companies efforts to understand the scope of an incident and take steps to protect any impacted businesses, employees, or customers; these authorities also conduct the official investigation into an incident and work to apprehend its perpetrators. A strong partnership with the relevant law enforcement agencies is critical to combatting an ongoing incident and to potentially recouping losses after an event has been contained. Yet, as Commissioner Peirce noted, the proposed rule is unduly dismissive of the need to cooperate with, and sometimes defer to, [the SECs] partners across the federal government and state government.22 The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to allow reporting flexibility for companies engaged with law enforcement in response to a cybersecurity attack. We further urge the SEC to work closely with the FBI and the DOJ to understand the potential risks to law enforcement investigations posed by premature public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and to amend its proposed reporting requirement accordingly.  While the NAM supports timely disclosure of information about material cybersecurity incidents, in certain instances it may be more beneficial to investors for companies not to disclose an incident immediately if doing so would interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation. The proposing release is cognizant of this dynamic, acknowledging that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents.23 Yet the proposed rule would not allow for  20 2018 Guidance, supra note 2, at 8168.  21 Id. at 8167.  22 Dissenting Statement on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposal. Commissioner Hester M. Peirce (9 March 2022). Available at https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce statement cybersecurity 030922.  23 Proposed Rule, supra note 1, at 16596.  10 any flexibility if, in law enforcements expert opinion, delaying public disclosure would enable them to better identify or apprehend wrongdoers or to protect the public from ongoing or future attacks.  Working with law enforcement, companies need the flexibility to balance the importance of prompt disclosure against any risks law enforcement identifies with respect to an ongoing investigation. The NAM understands and acknowledges that law enforcement investigations are often lengthy, so we are not suggesting that a carte blanche exemption is necessary to provide flexibility for companies to appropriately defer to law enforcement and protect their investors. However, the NAM strongly believes that companies should be allowed to balance the pros and cons of disclosure in the immediate aftermath of a cybersecurity incident and to make a determination as to the appropriate timeline for disclosure in consultation with the federal and state agencies investigating an attack. We respectfully encourage the SEC to reconsider its decision not to allow for any reporting flexibility even when law enforcement believes it would be in the best interest of an investigation. The ability to delay reporting until the danger has passed would be a commonsense allowance that would not undercut the efficacy of the proposed reporting requirement. In fact, such an allowance would ultimately benefit shareholders, who would be better served by a successful investigation that apprehends the perpetrator and protects the company and the economy from future attacks than they would by a top down reporting obligation that could endanger their investments further.  Similarly, companies in certain critical industries should be able to temporarily delay reporting in consideration of issues related to public safety. Premature disclosure could lead individuals to make health or safety related decisions based on incomplete information, such as deferring medical procedures or disconnecting certain types of devices. It can take significant time and effort, often alongside government authorities, to understand the scope of an incident, develop the correct fix for a vulnerability, and determine how to safely implement any necessary modifications. Companies also must work with the government to decide how best to communicate the appropriate information about health and safety related incidents to the public. Public safety, including patient safety, must be the top concern following cybersecurity incidents—so the NAM supports appropriate flexibility with respect to the SECs reporting deadline.  The proposing release does solicit comment on whether the Attorney General should be able to request that a company delay reporting if such a delay would be in the interest of national security. The NAM appreciates that the SEC is cognizant of the potential risk to national security, which we discuss in further detail below. And we also appreciate the suggestion that the DOJ could have a unique perspective on the appropriateness of making public certain information about critical cybersecurity incidents. However, the risks to investors posed by premature disclosure extend beyond just information that might implicate the United States national security. As discussed, publicly reporting information about an ongoing attack or investigation could interfere with law enforcements efforts to identify the perpetrator or recoup losses. These are critical goals, even if they do not rise to the level of a national security threat. Reporting delays should be available to companies in these instances; however, the NAM does not believe that businesses should be required to obtain a written determination from the Attorney General within four days in order to qualify for a delay. Rather, companies should be allowed to coordinate closely with the DOJ and the FBI (and/or other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies) and make a holistic assessment as to the risks posed to the business and the broader marketplace by premature public disclosure. The NAM supports a flexible SEC reporting requirement that allows for needed delays while still underscoring the importance of timely and accurate disclosure. 11 E. The SEC should provide an explicit reporting exemption for classified information and should allow companies to delay or forgo incident reports if necessary to protect the national security of the United States.  In some instances, the risk of premature disclosure is broader than the potential impacts on an individual company and its investors. For many businesses that work with the federal government, including those that contract with or are subject to regulations promulgated by agencies like DOD, DHS, and the State Department, reporting information about a cybersecurity incident could implicate classified information or endanger the United States national security.  Businesses that contract with the federal government are trusted with a range of sensitive information, and they are subject to strict rules (including criminal statutes) regarding the use and disclosure of this information. Similarly, businesses subject to DHS security regulations are prohibited from disclosing information about the operations of and materials stored in their facilities. As proposed, the SECs cybersecurity incident reporting framework does not provide any flexibility with respect to sensitive or classified information. If a breach were to implicate a classified program, impact a classified facility, or involve classified information, public companies would be put in the untenable position of choosing between violating an SEC rule requiring disclosure and criminal statutes or other regulations prohibiting it.24 Public disclosure of classified information (or, similarly, reports that allude to or implicate classified information even if not fully disclosing the information itself) creates legal risk for companies and potentially endangers all Americans. Classified information is classified for a reason, and the SEC should not require public companies to publish information that could put Americans at risk—even in service of shareholder transparency. The NAM strongly encourages the SEC to be explicit that public companies would be under no obligation to disclose classified information nor to violate any laws or agreements with respect to classified contracts, programs, or facilities. It is in the best interests of all Americans for such information to be fully exempt from the proposed disclosure requirement.  Further, businesses experiencing a cybersecurity incident may have access to information critical to national security that is not specifically classified. The existence of the attack itself also may implicate national security. For instance, suppose an incident is perpetrated by a foreign adversary of the United States—an increasingly common dynamic in todays geopolitical climate. A company experiencing such an attack should be allowed to first notify DOD, DHS, NSA, and/or the State Department and then defer to the judgement of the relevant agency as to the appropriateness of public disclosure about the incident, even if the incident may be material to shareholders. When cybersecurity incidents impact the United States national security, or when disclosure of these incidents could have the potential to do so, companies should not be hamstrung by a public reporting obligation promulgated by the SEC. Instead, they should have the flexibility to delay or forgo reporting in order to safeguard the United States national security and protect all Americans from potential harm.  The proposing release is at least cognizant of this risk, soliciting comment on whether companies should be allowed to delay reporting if the Attorney General determines that disclosure would impact national security. Though the DOJ and the law enforcement agencies it oversees (particularly the FBI) will undoubtedly play a role in helping companies understand the scope of an attack, including whether an incident implicates national security related information or was perpetrated by a foreign adversary or its affiliates, the proposing releases focus on the Attorney General as the sole arbiter of national security decisions is misplaced. Depending on the incident, DOD, DHS, NSA, or the State Department would likely have a more helpful perspective on the national security ramifications of  24 We would further note that obligations to avoid disclosure of classified information can extend beyond the United States. Many multinational businesses may be subject to state secret laws outside of the U.S., adding further complexity to the SECs proposed reporting requirement.  12 premature disclosure and whether public reporting would violate existing laws or regulations. If a company believes that disclosure with respect to a cybersecurity incident could imperil the United States national security, SEC rules should allow the company to coordinate with the relevant national security agencies and make an appropriate determination as to the timing and content of any public reports about the incident. The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to defer to these agencies and their expertise in order to protect all Americans and the national security of the United States.  IV. The SEC should rescind its proposed requirement that companies retrospectively analyze, aggregate, and potentially disclose the impact of previous immaterial cybersecurity incidents.  In addition to the current event reporting requirement for material cybersecurity incidents, the proposed rule would also require companies to provide disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate.25 The NAM opposes this requirement, which would impose a significant retrospective tracking and monitoring burden on companies without providing useful information to investors.  Immaterial incidents are by their very nature inconsequential to a business and its shareholders. Companies have processes and procedures in place to monitor and address these minor incidents, and they often take steps to identify patterns and guard against repeat attacks by the same or similar malicious actors. The number of minor incidents thwarted by company safeguards can reach the millions—but these unsuccessful attempts ultimately have little to no impact on a business. As such, it is not practical or helpful to investors for companies to conduct the retrospective analysis and ongoing monitoring that would be necessary to comply with the SECs proposed material in the aggregate reporting requirement. Constantly reviewing previous minor incidents and frequently updating a living materiality assessment to incorporate new information on additional immaterial events would be extremely costly and burdensome—and would represent an inefficient use of company time and resources given the lack of benefit for investors. Further, there is no clear framework for determining whether immaterial events may be related, which would create further confusion and divert additional time and resources. Ultimately, companies do not have systems in place to regularly update a list of minor events and determine if or when they might rise to the level of materiality. The proposed reporting requirement for immaterial incidents is therefore likely to prove extremely difficult and costly for businesses despite its minimal utility for investors.  In addition to these practical considerations, disclosing as material a previously undisclosed series of immaterial events could introduce questions about inadequate disclosure practices—even though each incident was immaterial and the company made the appropriate decision in not disclosing it. The contradiction inherent in identifying a given incident as both immaterial and material could confuse investors and unnecessarily increase liability for businesses.  The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to reconsider the proposed rules provisions related to reporting on a series of immaterial cybersecurity incidents and instead to focus on ensuring the appropriate reporting framework for material breaches. The NAM opposes the proposed requirement, as conducting regular backward looking materiality assessments about past minor incidents is not an efficient use of resources and will not provide useful information to investors seeking to understand a companys cybersecurity risks and practices. 25 Proposed Rule, supra note 1, at 16619.  13 V. The SEC should reconsider some of the proposed rules more prescriptive risk management and governance disclosure requirements and instead adopt a more principles based approach to cybersecurity risk reporting.  A. Detailed public disclosures about a companys cybersecurity strategy and risk management could prove more useful to bad actors than to investors.  The proposed rule would require companies to disclose on an annual basis their policies and procedures related to cybersecurity strategy and risk management. Given the importance of strong cybersecurity protections in todays interconnected economy, the NAM supports substantive disclosure of the policies and procedures that companies have implemented to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks—without providing a detailed playbook for potential hackers.  As such, the NAM appreciated that the SECs 2018 guidance provided companies an outline for appropriate cybersecurity risk disclosure. Pursuant to the guidance, companies are already required to report material information on their cybersecurity risks (including the aspects of their business that give rise to such risks, the costs of maintaining appropriate cybersecurity protections, and steps taken to prevent or mitigate cybersecurity risks),26 the effect of cybersecurity risks on their financial condition and their consolidated financial statements,27 and any cybersecurity impacts on their products and services or relationships with customers and suppliers.28  The proposing release does not appropriately justify why more granular risk management and strategy disclosures are now necessary. The areas of focus in the proposed rule largely align with the 2018 guidance, but the rule would impose more prescriptive reporting requirements on public companies at every turn—without providing the requisite degree of flexibility needed to tailor the disclosures to a businesss cybersecurity risk profile. It also would add significant burden and complexity given the increase in scrutiny and reporting obligations from other federal agencies since 2018. The NAM is concerned that the proposed risk management disclosures will not enhance cybersecurity, but rather will increase costs and confusion while also exposing potentially sensitive information to bad actors.  For example, the proposed risk management and strategy disclosures would require reporting on a companys cybersecurity risk assessment program, its activities to prevent and detect cybersecurity incidents, its cybersecurity contingency and recovery plans, and how previous incidents have informed any changes to its cybersecurity policies and procedures.29 In 2018, the Commission made clear that a company need not make detailed disclosures that could compromise its cybersecurity efforts—for example, by providing a ‘roadmap for those who seek to penetrate a companys security protections.30 Yet the risk management disclosures included in the proposed rule could provide just such a roadmap. Manufacturers support appropriate descriptions of a companys cybersecurity risk management practices that are sufficient to inform shareholders about a businesss risks and any efforts to mitigate them, but the SECs detailed and prescriptive reporting requirements (especially the requirement to disclose how policy changes have been informed by previous incidents) could endanger rather than protect investors by making a companys systems, networks, and devices more susceptible to a cybersecurity incident.31  26 See 2018 Guidance, supra note 2, at 8169.  27 See id. at 8170.  28 Ibid.  29 See Proposed Rule, supra note 1, at 16600.  30 2018 Guidance, supra note 2, at 8169.  31 Ibid.  14  The NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to adopt a more principles based approach to cybersecurity risk management and strategy disclosures. In 2018, the Commission made clear that it expect[s] companies to disclose cybersecurity risks and incidents that are material to investors, including the concomitant financial, legal, or reputational consequences.32 A disclosure framework based on this principle rather than line item reporting mandates would better serve shareholders in the long run.  B. The proposed requirement that public companies disclose the cybersecurity expertise of a specific board member could prove unnecessarily limiting.  The proposed rule would require companies to disclose their board and management cybersecurity governance and oversight practices. Companies would also be required to report on the cybersecurity expertise of company leadership.  In 2018, the SEC said that disclosures about the boards risk management processes should include the nature of the boards role in overseeing the management of material cybersecurity risks. The Commission also urged disclosure of how the board of directors engages with management on cybersecurity.33 To the extent that the proposed governance disclosure requirements align with the 2018 guidance on which companies already rely, the NAM supports appropriate reporting of both board and management oversight of cybersecurity risk. However, the NAM is concerned that the proposed requirement that public companies disclose the cybersecurity expertise of a specific board member could prove unnecessarily limiting. As a matter of first course, the NAM does not believe that it is appropriate for the SEC to mandate specific criteria for candidates to public company boards of directors. Company boards are charged with broad strategy, governance, and risk management duties, and issuers and their shareholders are free to nominate and elect directors with a mix of diverse experience and expertise in order to meet these challenges. The SEC should not require the consideration or election of certain types of director candidates or impose disclosure requirements designed to achieve similar goals. Specific to cybersecurity, manufacturers know that effective cybersecurity governance does not require a single director with a certain technical degree, but rather an enterprise wide focus on the issue and appropriate risk prioritization by the board. Effective risk management, including with respect to cybersecurity, falls under the purview of the entire board and management team, not just one director. Further, the proposed rules criteria for cybersecurity expertise are unnecessarily limiting and could discourage companies from considering otherwise qualified director candidates because their experience does not fit neatly under one of the SECs proposed credentials. The qualifications necessary to manage cybersecurity risk in todays evolving threat landscape may not always align with the limited criteria in the proposed rule, and the rules proposed qualifications could become more out of date as the threat landscape continues to evolve in the years to come. Further, the proposed rule focuses on specific technical expertise, job responsibilities, and professional certifications—yet the board of directors is charged with oversight and management of cybersecurity risk, not hands on technology implementation and incident response. Expertise in these critical areas should also be prized by public companies looking for board leadership, not just specific technical skills.34 32 Ibid.  33 Id. at 8170.  34 We would also note that diverting scarce talent away from operational jobs and toward board leadership could exacerbate companies workforce challenges and ultimately hinder their ability to protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. 15  To the extent that the final rule maintains a disclosure requirement with respect to the boards cybersecurity expertise, the NAM respectfully encourages the SEC to broaden its proposed definition of cybersecurity expertise to include experience overseeing and managing cybersecurity risk. The NAM is hopeful that the final rule will not effectively mandate a certain board composition nor unnecessarily limit the diversity and experience of a companys board of directors.  * * * *  The NAM appreciates the SECs continued attention to the importance of effective cybersecurity practices, governance, and risk management—and of appropriate disclosure of public companies cybersecurity risks and incidents. The NAM believes that, with certain targeted changes, the SECs proposed rule can support companies efforts to provide material cybersecurity disclosures to their investors. A final rule that requires timely and accurate reports without instituting one size fits all mandates will ensure that shareholders have access to useful information without exposing businesses, investors, and all Americans to increased risks. The NAM strongly supports a flexible approach to cybersecurity reporting, and manufacturers respectfully encourage the SEC to promulgate a final rule that allows public companies to both inform and protect their shareholders.

Crenshaw, and Hester M. Peirce U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE 100 F Street NE Washington, DC 20549  Dear SEC Commissioners, Companies have become highly reliant on cyber environments. These have absorbed critical parts of company operations in the last decades, in what has been called the digitalization process. Digitalization has opened new opportunities and improved productivity, leading tofinancial gains. Simultaneously, it has increased theirexposure to risks and attacks beyond the physical realm.Public companies, in particular, are attractive targets for perpetrators, arguably due to their large financial resources, the high volumes of data they process, and theirsocietal visibility. Cybersecurity incidents create a dilemma for companies, especially for public companies, who experience a complex trade off when disclosing cybersecurity incidents: the roadmap dilemma. This dilemma is associated with the need for a company to finetune its information sharing to blend transparency and defense against future attacks. The Commissions proposal addresses a critical need, which is the clarification to the market of what is understood as relevant and material information. We believe, in addition, that the Commission might further improve the efficacy of the proposal by more explicitly and intensively leveraging data from past cybersecurity incident disclosures made by public companies to that purpose. Specifically, this would allow lowering company acceptance hurdles, by better considering critical nuances in disclosed variables or what companies feel comfortable sharing at the moment regarding cybersecurity incidents.Shortcomings in meeting these critical aspects can hinder the success of the Proposed Rule. In our research, we have analyzed past disclosures to propose a bottom up classification for cybersecurity incidents that integrates the perspectives of perpetrators and targeted companies and considers such a roadmap dilemma. The details of our proposition are further presented in the following working paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4101510. We believe that our proposed classification could be beneficially integrated within enhanced future SEC disclosure rules, primarily in the scope of item 2 in your Request for comments section (p. 28). Furthermore, our classification can assist public companies with peer experience in addressing the roadmap dilemma. We hope that the fortunate coincidence between the conclusion of our research and the Commissions Request for Comment may translate into a valuable contribution to this proposal, and are fully open to further interacting with the Commission on the details of our study.

Dear Ms. Countryman:  Federated Hermes, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Federated Hermes)1 submit this comment letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission or the SEC) with respect to the Commissions request for comment on the Commissions proposed new cybersecurity rules for public companies (registrants) that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Proposal)2. The Commission has proposed, among other things:  Disclosing material cybersecurity incidents within four (4) business days, and providing updates related to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents; Disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management and strategy; Disclosures regarding cybersecurity governance; and Disclosures regarding board cybersecurity expertise.  We would like to state in advance that Federated Hermes supports most of the comments and positions of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) as set forth in its comment letter on the Proposal (SIFMA Letter), including:  i. Questioning the Commission being the proper cybersecurity regulator for registrants; ii. The proposed materiality standard is subjective and vague, and may lead to registrants over reporting cybersecurity incidents, weakening the concept of materiality;  iii. Four (4) business days is an insufficient amount of time to investigate and report a material cybersecurity incident;  1 Federated Hermes, Inc.

Ms. Vanessa Countryman Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page Two iv. There should be consistency among existing state and federal cybersecurity incident reporting requirements; v. Disclosed material cybersecurity incidents should not include mention of any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors;  vi. Cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance disclosure should not include any sensitive details that are not critical to the publics knowledge; and vii. Rather than disclose a particular Board members cybersecurity expertise, the Commission should instead permit registrants to disclose if members of the Board engage in regular cybersecurity training.  We understand the Commissions desire to better inform investors about material cybersecurity risks and incidents on a timely basis3, but have concerns about the Proposals new disclosure requirements for registrants as noted in the SIFMA letter and herein. I. Disclosing Material Cybersecurity Incidents  The Proposal would amend Form 8 K to require registrants to disclose information about a cybersecurity incident within four (4) business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident.4 This puts a burden on the registrant to understand what constitutes a material cybersecurity incident. Registrants need to thoroughly and objectively evaluate the total mix of information, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the cybersecurity incident, including both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether the incident is material.5  Materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the information6, regardless of likelihood of an adverse outcome. This subjective materiality standard, coupled with a potentially impending filing deadline in order to comply with the four (4) business day disclosure requirement, will result in registrants over reporting cybersecurity incidents, which may lead to investors undervaluing cybersecurity incident disclosures. While the Commission expects a registrants materiality determination to be made as soon as reasonably practicable after its discovery of the incident7, such a determination can take a registrant a substantial amount of time from the discovery of the cybersecurity incident to determine that the incident is, individually or in aggregate, material. Accordingly, we question the overall benefit of the requirement of filing within four (4) business days of such determination. Although the timeframe for filing is conditioned on the registrants determination that a material event has occurred, the requirement as drafted would likely facilitate early disclosure of events which may eventually turn out to be immaterial, resulting in over disclosure and potential investor confusion. A regime that required telephonic notification to the Commission of a potential material event, coupled with a requirement to file an 8 K at the resolution of a determined material event, would, in our view, be a better approach. 3 Id. at 99. 4 Id. at 18. 5 Id. at 23 6 Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. at 240 (1988). 7 Proposal at 22.  Ms. Vanessa Countryman Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page Three We believe in overall consistency with respect to cybersecurity incident reporting obligations, regardless of industry, in order to avoid conflicting or overlapping regulations and requirements. Accordingly, we ask that the Commission consider, where possible, synchronization of any notification required by the Proposal with other existing state and federal laws. Further, we raise particular concern that the public disclosure of details of significant cybersecurity incidents can have unintended consequences. Disclosure of any sensitive details of cybersecurity incidents that are not critical to the publics knowledge should not be required as disclosing such details can lead to exploitation by cyber threat actors in future cybersecurity incidents. Accordingly, we recommend that cybersecurity incident disclosures only contain limited, general information that cannot be used by cyber threat actors to orchestrate future cybersecurity incidents (specific details regarding successful attack strategies or a registrants remediation efforts should be omitted).  II. Disclosing Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy and Governance  The Proposal further requires enhanced disclosure related to: (i) a registrants policies and procedures for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity risks; (ii) the board of directors role in oversight of cybersecurity risks; and (iii) managements role in implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures. According to the Commission, disclosure of the relevant policies and procedures, to the extent a registrant has established any, would benefit investors by providing greater transparency as to the registrants strategies and actions to manage cybersecurity risks.8 Further, the Commission also stated in the Proposal that disclosure regarding board oversight of a registrants cybersecurity risk and the inclusion or exclusion of management from the oversight of cybersecurity risks and the implementation of related policies, procedures, and strategies impacts an investors ability to understand how a registrant prepares for, prevents, or responds to cybersecurity incidents.9  However, disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance may increase the vulnerability of registrants to cybersecurity incidents. As previously mentioned, disclosures should not contain any sensitive details that are not critical to the publics knowledge as disclosing such details can lead to exploitation by cyber threat actors in future cybersecurity incidents. Accordingly, any disclosures related to a registrants cybersecurity management and governance should only contain limited, general information that cannot be used by cyber threat actors to orchestrate future cybersecurity incidents (i.e., registrants should not be required to disclose the actual content of their policies and procedures as such proprietary information may be used against the registrant by a threat actor). III. Disclosing Board Expertise The Proposal also requires disclosure about the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board, if any. While the Proposal does not define cybersecurity expertise, it does include a non exclusive list of criteria that a registrant may consider when determining whether a member of the board has expertise, including: prior work experience in cybersecurity; any relevant degrees or certifications; or any knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity. If expertise is to be disclosed, then the Commission should provide a definition of, or clarification on what constitutes, expertise. This would alleviate potentially misleading   8 Id. at 35. 9 Id. at 39   Ms. Vanessa Countryman Securities and Exchange Commission May 9, 2022 Page Four  disclosure. The Commission also should make clear that requiring disclosure of a board members cybersecurity expertise does not require that a board have any board members that are cybersecurity experts. Alternatively, instead of disclosing a particular Board members cybersecurity expertise, the Commission should instead permit registrants to disclose if members of the Board engage in regular cybersecurity training.  IV. Compliance Date We note that the Proposal does not set forth a compliance date or transition period. Accordingly, while the Commission does not request comment on timing, we believe that the Commission should provide a reasonable transition period that will give registrants sufficient time to comply with the final rules requirements. We recommend a minimum compliance period of at least 24 months, should the Proposal be adopted substantially as proposed. * * *  Federated Hermes appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposal. We are readily available to provide any additional information relating to our comments or discuss any questions that the Commission may have.  Sincerely, Peter J.

The GPA works to encourage responsible global privacy practices that enhance consumer trust as well as preserve the free flow of information. Members of the GPA take their privacy and data security obligations seriously. The views expressed in this letter generally represent the views of the members of the GPA. While all members support the overall approach presented, certain of the individual points raised may not be relevant to, or shared by, all members. The GPA offers comments on three aspects of the Cybersecurity Rule, which, if implemented in its current form, could hamper law enforcement investigations of serious cybersecurity incidents and result in uninformed, or partially informed, disclosures that may not provide investors with the transparency the proposed rule seeks to achieve. First, the Cybersecurity Rules proposed disclosure requirements lack a much needed law enforcement exception to the four business day disclosure deadline for cybersecurity incidents deemed to be material. Second, the Cybersecurity Rule, as written, provides insufficient guidance to    1 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16,590 (Mar. 23, 2022) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. 229, 232, 239, 240, 249).   May 9, 2022 Page Two  public companies as to when immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate, and the time period over which public companies should assess and analyze immaterial incidents for aggregation purposes. Third, the Cybersecurity Rules proposed requirement that issuers should provide specific information about their cybersecurity risk management and strategy, including a description of their risk assessment program and identification and management of cybersecurity risks and threats, may very well subject public companies to further attacks as bad actors can use these disclosures as a roadmap. A Final Cybersecurity Disclosure Rule Should Include a Law Enforcement Exception An important way that public companies learn that they have been the victim of a cybersecurity attack is through law enforcement notification. These notifications often include information that law enforcement agencies need to keep confidential in order to apprehend a bad actor. Thus, a law enforcement exception is essential to both holding cyber criminals accountable and ensuring that public companies are notified that they have been attacked. Indeed, as the SECs 2018 guidance on cybersecurity disclosures noted, We also recognize that it may be necessary to cooperate with law enforcement and that ongoing investigation of a cybersecurity incident may affect the scope of disclosure regarding the incident.2  The proposed Cybersecurity Rule, however, explicitly declines to provide for this essential disclosure exception, with limited explanation as to why the Commission is reversing course from prior guidance. The Cybersecurity Rule would amend Form 8 K to add a new Item 1.05 that would require an issuer to disclose known information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of its materiality determination.3 It would not provide for any disclosure delay due to ongoing law enforcement investigations, although the Cybersecurity Rule recognizes that a delay in reporting may facilitate law enforcement investigations aimed at apprehending the perpetrators of the cybersecurity incident and preventing future cybersecurity incidents.4 Indeed, the Cybersecurity Rule brushes aside law enforcement considerations, and state and federal laws that explicitly provide for a law enforcement exception, to conclude that disclosures to investors should trump apprehension of cybercriminals.    2 Securities and Exchange Commission, Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 83 Fed. Reg. 8,166, 8,169 (Feb. 26, 2018), https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2018/33 10459.pdf. 3 If the date of the materiality determination becomes the trigger for the four business day reporting deadline, the Cybersecurity Rule states that the Commission expect[s] registrants to be diligent in making a materiality determination in as prompt a manner as feasible. Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,596. 4 Id.   May 9, 2022 Page Three  Our members work closely with law enforcement agencies on cybersecurity matters and believe that the lack of a specific law enforcement exception to disclosure will harm the broader public, including investors. Companies often learn from law enforcement that cybercriminals have attacked them. This information can be based on sensitive information obtained from confidential sources and methods that would be compromised if prematurely disclosed. Once public companies receive information about a cyberattack from law enforcement, frequently they cooperate with law enforcement on operations that will enable law enforcement to disrupt malicious cyber actors or prevent future attacks—operations that may take longer than four business days to execute. If law enforcement agencies know that public companies may have an obligation to disclose information shared with them within a matter of days, they may be less willing to make such victim notifications and there may be fewer opportunities to disrupt or prevent criminal activity, thereby putting companies and investors at greater risk.  The proposed Cybersecurity Rules lack of a law enforcement exception is also inconsistent with the laws of all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Guam concerning cybersecurity breach notification. An important feature of the state breach laws is victim notification. These myriad laws generally provide that law enforcement agencies must notify victims of a cyber breach, but law enforcement can request that a company keep the information confidential from customers and other potential victims. In our experience, such provisions have been used infrequently and have not been abused by law enforcement agencies.  Yet there is a disharmony between the proposed Cybersecurity Rule, which declines to recognize a law enforcement exception, and these state breach notification laws, which appreciate and incorporate this necessary exception. While the former requires that public notice of the incident be given within a short and strict timeframe after the materiality determination, the latter have all agreed that apprehension of cybercriminals justifies delayed disclosure in certain, limited circumstances. These divergent approaches could result in uneven information flows, with the potential for news of an incident to reach unaffected third parties before individualized notice is given to customers and others who are directly harmed.5 The Commissions notice of proposed rulemaking asks for comment on whether the rule should provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security?6 The answer, in our view, is yes—we believe that a delay of    5 Indeed, if adopted, the proposed rules disclosure obligations may also conflict with soon to be adopted confidential reporting obligations to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (or CISA), which will apply to critical infrastructure providers. Consolidated Appropriations Act 2022, Pub. L. No. 117 103, § 2242, 136 Stat. 49 (2022) (Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act). 6 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. at 16,598.   May 9, 2022 Page Four  disclosure in such circumstances would be essential and that national security concerns should trump timely notification to investors. But we also believe that the question frames the issue too narrowly in two respects. First, the exclusion for law enforcement should not be limited solely to the national security context. There are many cybersecurity incidents that present significant public safety concerns, but not necessarily national security concerns, such as incidents involving sophisticated criminal organizations. The delay provision, therefore, should apply to situations affecting both national security, public safety, and other important interests.  Second, the Attorney General should not be the only official who can make a determination of the impact to national security, public safety or other concerns. Numerous law enforcement agencies provide notices of cybersecurity incidents, and do so notwithstanding ongoing sensitive investigations. Such agencies include the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the U.S. Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security, the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and numerous law enforcement agencies within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. Rather than allowing such determinations to be made solely by the Attorney General, the rule should allow any head of a law enforcement agency to make such a determination.  The Proposed Rule Lacks Sufficient Guidance on How, and When, to Make Aggregated Materiality Determinations for Individually Immaterial Cybersecurity Incidents The proposed requirement that public companies disclose when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate7 lacks much needed guidance and, as a practical matter, may be a solution in search of a problem. The proposed rule would include a Proposed Item 106(d)(2) of Regulation S K, requiring public companies to analyze related cybersecurity incidents for materiality, both individually and in the aggregate.8 Other than providing a nonspecific example that a number of smaller but continuous cyber attacks related in time and form against the same company9 could be material in the aggregate, the proposed rule lacks guidance on (1) when immaterial incidents can become material, quantitatively or qualitatively, in the aggregate and (2) the time period over which public companies must aggregate immaterial cybersecurity incidents.   7 Id. at 16,599. 8 Id.  9 Id.  May 9, 2022 Page Five  First, public companies need guidance on when immaterial incidents can become material.10 Many public companies face a barrage of disparate, immaterial cybersecurity incidents in any given quarter, ranging from things like laptop or smartphone theft to unsuccessful phishing scams.11 As a practical matter, it is hard to envision a scenario where these unrelated, immaterial incidents have such an aggregate impact on a companys operations and financial statements that they amount to a material incident. To the extent that the Commission has some basis for proposing this disclosure requirement, more guidance is essential. For example, what makes a cybersecurity incident related to other incidents? Does the proposed requirement mean that public companies must track each and every immaterial cybersecurity incident to plan for the very unlikely event that they may be material in the aggregate? In practice, this proposed disclosure requirement will create inefficiencies and extra work for IT and legal departments alike with very little likelihood that investors will receive any additional information of benefit to their investing decisions. Second, the proposed requirement that companies disclose immaterial incidents that become material in the aggregate is lacking a much needed time period over which companies must aggregate individual and immaterial incidents. Must companies track each and every immaterial cybersecurity incident—which could include every attempted phishing scam, malware installation, or hardware theft—into perpetuity? Or, conversely, must public company legal departments conduct a quarterly review of all immaterial incidents, effectively wiping the slate clean each quarter? The onus of the first approach (i.e. perpetual tracking of immaterial incidents) on large public companies is obviously immense. But even a quarterly review of each and every immaterial cybersecurity incident places a huge burden on IT and legal groups. Many public companies are the victims of near daily, unsuccessful and immaterial cybersecurity attacks. A quarterly review would require logging, categorization, review, and discussion of minor incidents, taking valuable resources away from managing the day to day business operations that are critical to investor satisfaction. Public Companies Should Not be Compelled to Provide Cyber Criminals an Attack Roadmap Via Disclosure of Their Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures In 2018, the Commission stressed, appropriately, the real need for public companies to adopt and implement policies and procedures that are tailored to the unique risks that each company faces.12 Our members take this guidance very seriously. In 2018, the Commission    10 Indeed, even the examples of material cybersecurity incidents provided in the proposed rule itself may not meet the materiality threshold under the SECs 2018 guidance.  11 These numerous and frequently occurring examples do not meet the current materiality threshold, but, without more specific guidance on the timing and manner of disclosure required, these events could lead to a massive increase in notifications to investors about breaches, diluting the effect of communications generally and detracting focus from breaches that are truly material. 12 Securities and Exchange Commission, Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, 83 Fed. Reg. at 8,169.   May 9, 2022 Page Six  also recognized that a requirement that public companies make detailed disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management could provide a ‘roadmap for those who seek to penetrate a companys security protections.13 The Commission appears to have shifted course without guidance or clarification. The proposed Cybersecurity Rules mandate that companies disclose policies and procedures for cybersecurity risk management will give cybercriminals exactly the type of roadmap that the Commission expressed concern about just four years ago. If enacted, the proposed rule would add proposed Item 106(b) to Regulation S K, requiring issuers to describe in Form 10 K their policies and procedures, if any, for the identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats.14 These include identification of policies and procedures to identify and manage cyber related risks and threats, including operational risk, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers, legal violations and risks, and reputational risks.15 Proposed Items 106(b)(1), (3), (4), (6), and (7) are of particular concern to our members: collectively, these proposed items provide direction to cybercriminals of how to spot vulnerabilities and what to disable if they gain access to an issuers IT environment.16 For example, requiring public companies to disclose whether and how cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of third parties, including the contractual and other mechanisms the company uses to mitigate risk, could expose companies to malicious actors focused on identifying patterns of selection and potentially put companies at a competitive disadvantage if detailed information is publicly available. Requiring public companies to provide more than confirmation of the existence of policies helps neither companies nor investors and may subject public companies to additional litigation risks. Similarly, proposed Item 106(d)(1)s requirement that public    13 Id.  14 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed.

May 9, 2022 Page Seven companies disclose any changes in a companys policies and procedures as a result of a material cybersecurity incident serves to highlight potential vulnerabilities for cybercriminals.  Our members are concerned that the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures will undermine their cybersecurity defense efforts and make them more vulnerable to serious cybersecurity attacks. This will harm not only public companies, but their investors and capital markets as well. The federal securities laws disclosure regime is grounded in materiality: investors are best protected when they receive material information about public companies. The level of specificity contemplated by the proposed changes to Item 106, however, will not increase the flow of material information to investors (which is already happening under the current framework) but will make the very companies they invest in more susceptible to cyberattacks.  Conclusion Certain aspects of the proposed Cybersecurity Rule—namely, the lack of a law enforcement exception to the four business day disclosure requirement, the requirement to disclose certain immaterial incidents, and the mandate to disclose cybersecurity risk management policies and procedures—are an unnecessary and potentially harmful departure from the current materiality based disclosure regime. The lack of a law enforcement exception will chill law enforcement notification of companies that have been attacked, leaving companies and their customers unaware that they have been victimized, and will prevent companies from cooperating with law enforcement to apprehend cybercriminals. The requirement that companies disclose immaterial cybersecurity incidents that, in the aggregate, become material is unworkable without further guidance as to the types of incidents the Commission is contemplating and a time period to prevent perpetual logging and re reviewing of immaterial incidents. And, finally, the requirement that companies disclose specifics about their cybersecurity risk management, including activities they undertake to prevent and detect attacks, will only increase the harm that companies and investors face by providing cybercriminals with a roadmap of companies IT environments and vulnerabilities. By contrast, the existing disclosure regime, which is grounded in materiality, protects both investors and the public companies in which they invest.  Sincerely,  Miriam H. Wugmeister Haimavathi V.

(we or SandboxAQ) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Security and Exchange Commissions (the Commission) proposed rule establishing a framework for disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management, governance and incident reporting by public companies subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Cybersecurity Proposal).1 We appreciate the Commissions interest in enhancing and standardizing disclosure regarding cybersecurity risks in order to provide transparency for investors.  Background of SandboxAQ SandboxAQ is an enterprise SaaS company developing commercial solutions at the nexus of quantum technology and artificial intelligence (AI). We focus on quantum resistant cryptography, or post quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum sensing, quantum simulation and quantum communications and work closely with commercial and public sector stakeholders to identify and develop solutions to quantum related opportunities and threats. Our work and collaboration with stakeholders have broad implications for the government, computer security, telecom, financial services, healthcare, aerospace, defense, transportation and other data intensive sectors. Our core focus and capabilities include the following:  ● Cybersecurity  Protecting large enterprises against quantum related threats from independent or state sponsored adversaries targeting RSA encrypted data, information, networks, infrastructure, communications and more. ● Quantum Sensing  Leveraging quantum magnetometry and AI to detect previously undetectable stimuli, leading to breakthroughs in navigation, detection, imaging and other use cases that could enhance our global leadership and strengthen national security. 1 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529; File No. S7 09 22 (March 9, 2022) (the Proposing Release).  DB2/ 43103143.1 ● Quantum Simulation  Digitally simulating quantum interactions at the molecular level, which will collapse the research and development time and cost for drug discovery, product design, prototyping and development, materials science and other broad use cases. ● Quantum Communications  Designing next generation hardware leveraging properties of quantum mechanics and entanglement to enable secure, long distance, end to end transmission of quantum data and information across a large collection of quantum computers and sensors. Through collaboration with the federal government, we have shaped the adoption of zero trust principles and approaches (Zero Trust) for securing federal information systems and networks. Zero Trust is an approach to cybersecurity that secures an organizations information networks by rejecting the assumption that users within such networks should be implicitly trusted. Rather, under Zero Trust, digital interactions are validated at every stage. Zero Trust is designed to protect modern environments and enable digital transformation by enforcing strict authentication methods, leveraging network segmentation, limiting internal lateral movement, providing layer 7 threat prevention, and simplifying granular, least access security policies.2 The federal Zero Trust initiative runs under the authority of the Federal CIO Council, a forum of federal Chief Information Officers, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST) is a partner in the effort, leading research and technical work with volunteers from other federal agencies. The comments and suggested amendments to the Cybersecurity Proposal set forth below are informed by the Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles released by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget on January 26, 2022.3  PQC refers to methods of data and digital communication encryption that are resistant to cyberattacks by quantum computers, which pose a serious threat to many of the cryptographic algorithms (particularly public key cryptography) that are currently widely used to protect digital information. By developing new kinds of cryptographic approaches that can be implemented using modern classical computers, PQC helps ensure that organizations and their networks will be protected against future attacks from quantum computers, particularly as such computing power becomes increasingly common.4 Key Recommendations for Cybersecurity Proposal In principle, we support the Commissions efforts to bolster disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving threats that cybersecurity incidents pose to public companies and capital markets. In the following sections, we suggest amendments that build upon the proposed disclosure regime and endeavor to further protect investors by providing them with more fulsome, standardized information regarding companies cybersecurity risk management practices and risk profiles. Specifically, the Commission should (1) require registrants to provide additional disclosure on prospective risk mitigation efforts, including the use or planned use of PQC in response to growing quantum computing threats, (2) incorporate forward looking elements, such as access to continuing education, into the list of criteria used to determine board 2 Scott Rose, Oliver Borchert, Stu Mitchell & Sean Connelly, Zero Trust Architecture, NIST Special Publication  800 207 (August 2020), available at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800 207.pdf.  3 U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles (January 26, 2022), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp content/uploads/2022/01/M 22 09.pdf.  4 For more information on PQC, see National Institute of Standards and Technology, Post Quantum Cryptography, available at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post quantum cryptography. DB2/ 43103143.1 expertise in cybersecurity and (3) further standardize the terms and standards used to inform investors of companies cybersecurity risk profiles. 1. Registrants should provide additional prospective disclosure on their cybersecurity risk management and mitigation plans, including disclosure of PQC related practices. One of the principal goals of the Cybersecurity Proposal is to provide investors with a more meaningful, comprehensive understanding of the growing cybersecurity risks registrants are facing, so that they may properly value companies securities and make well informed investment decisions that allocate capital efficiently.5 As the threat posed to commonly used data encryption and protection methods by quantum computing continues to grow and evolve, investors would benefit from more detailed disclosure regarding registrants prospective risk mitigation measures, including whether companies have implemented or plan to implement PQC to protect data and digital infrastructure from future cybersecurity attacks. Accordingly, and in response to the Commissions request for comment on whether the new Item 106(b) of Regulation S K should be adopted as proposed, SandboxAQ recommends supplementing the language of Item 106(b)(1)(iv) to solicit additional information on the PQC related measures that registrants have taken to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents.6 Such amended Item 106(b)(1)(iv) should thus read, The registrant undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents, and if so, provide a description of the types of activities undertaken and identify whether such activities include methods of quantum resistant encryption of post quantum cryptography.  Although this disclosure obligation could yield a number of valuable responses, examples of the types of information solicited might include:  ● whether registrants have created a cryptographic inventory to know what cryptography is used in their infrastructure;  ● whether companies encryption is currently in compliance with quantum resistant algorithms and technology, as defined by the NIST;  ● whether registrants maintain complete inventories of systems using non compliant encryption;  ● whether registrants have a timeline to transition systems using non complaint encryption to begin using compliant encryption; and  ● whether registrants maintain a complete inventory of every device authorized and operated for official business.  Such information would enhance understanding of companies susceptibility to future cybersecurity incidents, allowing investors to better evaluate how cybersecurity related costs could impact the value of such companies securities and thus make better informed investment decisions. The resulting reduction in information asymmetry between investors and registrants could in turn augment the positive indirect and spillover effects of the Cybersecurity Proposal already highlighted by the Commission.7 For example, if companies respond to this obligation by adopting measures to implement PQC and protect themselves against quantum related threats, their vulnerability to future cyber attacks and the likelihood of resulting negative externalities would be reduced. In turn, this could have the positive effect of accelerating the 5 Proposing Release at 53.  6 Proposing Release at 106. 7 Proposing Release at 82. DB2/ 43103143.1 already likely replacement of current cryptographic protocols with PQC, which is particularly important for applications with long term security requirements or especially sensitive data. Additionally, the mere disclosure of a cybersecurity risk mitigation plan commensurate with the risk level of secured information could have the secondary effect of deterring bad actors from future cybersecurity attacks.  Disclosure of cybersecurity risk management through PQC implementation and migration plans, as well as enhanced disclosure on any known role of quantum threats in material cybersecurity incidents, could also be incorporated into the new Item 1.05 of Form 8 K. As currently proposed, Item 1.05 focuses largely on backward looking disclosure involving material cybersecurity incidents, including information on the timing, scope and effects of such an incident and any present efforts to remediate the incident.8 In response to the Commissions request for comment on whether Item 1.05 should require any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident, SandboxAQ suggests that registrants reporting a material incident should also disclose whether their efforts to mitigate or remedy the incident involve use or implementation of PQC. Such a disclosure obligation could be imposed by amending the proposed Item 1.05(a)(5) to read, whether the registrant has remediated or is currently remediating the incident, and if so, whether such remedial measures include methods of quantum resistant encryption of post quantum cryptography. Further, Item 1.05 should require that registrants disclose any imminent threats to electronic information  particularly high risk information, such as healthcare or financial data  resulting from a material cybersecurity incident known to stem from quantum computing. Such information would provide investors with a better understanding of the post incident risk profile of registrants, as well as the likelihood of extended harmful impacts from the incident. 2. Companies should consider whether directors undergo continuing cybersecurity education in determining whether they have expertise in the field. The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed amendments to Item 407 of Regulation S K should be modified to require additional information with respect to board members expertise in cybersecurity.9 While we believe the changes to Item 407 set forth in the Cybersecurity Proposal take an important step towards recognizing and solidifying the crucial role that board leadership plays in shaping companies approach to cybersecurity risk management and mitigation, we suggest adding more forward looking elements to the list of criteria that registrants are prompted to consider when determining the portion of their board with cybersecurity expertise.  As proposed, the factors to be considered in establishing expertise are uniformly backward looking and include prior work experience, certifications or degrees and other background knowledge and skills.10 This approach fails to account for the fact that cybersecurity expertise is a dynamic, evolving body of knowledge and that leadership must remain informed of new threats and technologies, such as PQC and related quantum capabilities, to adequately manage and oversee companies cybersecurity programs and responses. SandboxAQ recommends remedying this gap by adding, and whether the director participates in continuing education programs related to cybersecurity to the factors listed in the proposed Item 407(j)(1)(i).11 Such addition would help ensure that any director disclosed as having 8  Proposing Release at 21.  9  Proposing Release at 46.  10  Proposing Release at 45. 11  Proposing Release at 110.  DB2/ 43103143.1 cybersecurity expertise maintains a current, well informed understanding of trends in cybersecurity risk management. In turn, this would provide investors with a more meaningful understanding of the caliber of board cybersecurity oversight and allow them to make better informed investment and director voting decisions. 3. Disclosure required by the Cybersecurity Proposal should be further standardized through utilization of NIST definitions and frameworks.  We support the Commissions stated objective of standardizing cybersecurity disclosure to facilitate the comparison of such disclosure across companies for investors.12 However, the Cybersecurity Proposal would benefit from further standardization through consistent use of definitions and frameworks established by the NIST. For example, in response to the Commissions request for comment on whether defining cybersecurity in the proposed Item 106(a) of Regulation S K would be helpful for investors and registrants, SandboxAQ supports providing a defined term and further suggests relying upon the definition set forth by the NIST: prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.13 As a term foundational to the understanding and implementation of the Cybersecurity Proposal, cybersecurity should be defined so as to clarify for registrants the scope of their disclosure obligations and to provide investors with a baseline understanding of this complex and multifaceted concept.  Using a definition that aligns with the NISTs will also facilitate and ease compliance for registrants, as the NIST is widely recognized as a standard setting organization at the forefront of cybersecurity expertise. Through its research and guidance, the NIST helps companies of disparate sizes and from various sectors better understand, manage and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data. In 2017, Executive Order No. 13800 made use of the NISTs cybersecurity framework (discussed further below) mandatory for all federal agencies, further solidifying the organizations credibility and authority.14 Implementing the NIST definition would also be consistent with the Commissions approach to defining other terms in the Cybersecurity Proposal, such as cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat and information systems, which draw upon language from the NIST glossary.15 Along with use of the NIST definition of cybersecurity, SandboxAQ recommends that the Commission supplement the Cybersecurity Proposal with a requirement that registrants disclose whether they utilize or have a plan in place to begin utilizing the NISTs Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the NIST Framework) in managing their cybersecurity risks.16 Because 12 Proposing Release at 11.  13 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Security Resource Center Glossary, available  at https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cybersecurity.  14 Executive Order No. 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure (May 11, 2017), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR 2017 05 16/pdf/2017 10004.pdf.  15 Proposing Release at 41.  16 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary, publicly available set of standards, guidelines and practices for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It was originally developed by the NIST in collaboration with industry stakeholders upon the issuance of Executive Order No. 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure DB2/ 43103143.1 cybersecurity risk management is highly technical and rapidly changing, investors without expertise in the field would benefit from simplified baseline disclosure rooted in the standards of a credible third party. Such disclosure would complement the more granular information provided by our proposed disclosure on PQC and quantum related threats (which would likely prove more beneficial to sophisticated market participants) by allowing investors to easily understand and evaluate the overall quality of companies risk management practices. Disclosure regarding use of the NIST Framework meets this investor need and imposes minimal compliance burdens for companies for several reasons, including the NISTs previously discussed reputation as an esteemed source of third party data and standards. Additionally, the NIST Framework is widely used by industry actors across size and sector, rendering it easily recognizable to companies complying with the new disclosure obligations. Lastly, because it is comprised of general standards and guidance that can be adapted to a particular companys size, operations and risk management needs, the NIST Framework provides the most appropriate touchstone for easily comparing cybersecurity risk profiles across industries.  *****************  In evaluating possible changes to the disclosure regime set forth in the Cybersecurity Proposal, we urge the Commission to maximize benefits for investors, registrants and capital markets by establishing robust and meaningful disclosure obligations. Such obligations should yield thorough information on the prospective elements of companies cybersecurity risk preparedness, including the use of PQC and the availability of ongoing education for directors with cybersecurity expertise, and should utilize standardized terms and frameworks set forth by the NIST. We also encourage both the Commission and lawmakers to consider how requiring specific actions and cybersecurity protections, such as PQC, would supplement this valuable disclosure regarding registrants cybersecurity infrastructure and further benefit companies, investors, markets and other stakeholders.

We write to you to share research backed insights on the potential effects of the SECs recently proposed cybersecurity disclosure rule (file number S7 09 22). We organize our comments in six parts:  • Trade offs of requiring firms to disclose cyber incidents within an explicit deadline • Cybersecurity benefits of requiring firms to disclose cyber incidents • Unintended consequences of providing firms with more structure when disclosing cybersecurity risk factors • Benefits of having a board member with information technology or cybersecurity expertise • Spillover benefits of cyber incident disclosures • Concluding remarks  Trade offs of requiring firms to disclose cyber incidents within an explicit deadline  Findings in Academic Research Data breach notification laws are U.S. state level laws that require firms to disclose the occurrence of a data breach to people whose personal information is leaked in the breach. Some of these data breach notification laws require firms to disclose the occurrence of a data breach within a certain deadline while other data breach notification laws do not mandate an explicit deadline. Ashraf, Jiang, and Wang (2022)1 examine how having an explicit deadline to disclose the occurrence of a data breach impacts the timing and information content of that data breach disclosure. They find that:  • firms facing an explicit deadline disclose the occurrence of a data breach 89.82 percent faster than firms without such a deadline; • firms facing an explicit deadline are 57.71 percent less likely to include details about how the breach happened and what data was leaked; and  1 Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4068575. 2 The Eli Broad College of Business  Accounting and Information Systems  Michigan State University North Business Complex 632 Bogue Street, Rm N270 East Lansing, MI 48824 Phone: 517 355 7486 Fax: 517 432 1101 Accounting.broad.msu.edu  • investors respond more negatively to the occurrence of a data breach when firms delay disclosure, but investors are more forgiving (i.e., less of a negative reaction) when the delay is used to gather and report breach details. Implications for New Proposed Rule  Ashraf et al. (2022)s findings suggest that there is a trade off when mandating an explicit short deadline to disclose the occurrence of a cyber incident: requiring firms to disclose a cyber incident within four days of discovery  as the new SEC rule proposes  will likely result in faster disclosure that contain less information content about the cyber incident.  Given the findings of Ashraf et al. (2022), there are two potential paths forward  a single disclosure regime or a two step disclosure regime. Under a single disclosure regime, the proposed four days deadline likely needs to be extended to a longer deadline, to allow for enough time to include important details in the disclosure. While it is difficult to say what the optimal deadline should be, a longer time frame would be required if the new rules intention is to increase the informativeness of the disclosure.  An alternative to the single disclosure regime is to mandate a two step disclosure regime. Step one is to require firms to issue a skeleton disclosure to inform investors, via 8 K, about the occurrence of a cyber incident within four days of discovery. Step two is to require the initial disclosure to be followed up with a second comprehensive disclosure detailing the cyber incident at some point after the initial skeleton disclosure (e.g., 30 or 60 days after). The two step disclosure regime may even allow the SEC to reduce the four days disclosure deadline to something as short as 24 hours, if firms are only making a skeleton disclosure initially.  Cybersecurity benefits of requiring firms to disclose cyber incidents  Findings in Academic Research Ashraf and Sunder (2022)2 study the effects of data breach notification laws on firms cybersecurity investments and oversight. They document that firms increase their investments in cybersecurity after these laws have been passed, because firms desire to avoid disclosing bad news (i.e., firms want to avoid having to incur a data breach that firms would now need to disclose). Overall, this enhanced focus on cybersecurity ultimately benefits shareholders through a decreased cost of equity capital and higher firm value.  2 Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3308551. 3 The Eli Broad College of Business  Accounting and Information Systems  Michigan State University North Business Complex 632 Bogue Street, Rm N270 East Lansing, MI 48824 Phone: 517 355 7486 Fax: 517 432 1101 Accounting.broad.msu.edu  Implications for New Proposed Rule  The findings of Ashraf and Sunder (2022) suggest that mandating firms to disclose the occurrence of cyber incidents in 8 K filings will create stronger incentives for firms to enhance their cybersecurity, through greater investments in cybersecurity, in order to decrease the chance of a cyber incident that firms must now disclose to investors. Unintended consequences of providing firms with more structure when disclosing cybersecurity risk factors  Findings in Academic Research Ashraf (2021)3 studies how greater SEC guidance on cybersecurity risk factors impacts the structure of these risk factor disclosures. He documents herding behavior: after the SECs 2011 cyber risk disclosure guidance, firms issued less unique cybersecurity risk factors and started issuing risk factors that more closely match the wording of the SECs 2011 guidance. He also finds that shareholders find more unique (not boilerplate) cybersecurity risk factor disclosures to be more informative.  Implications for New Proposed Rule  If the SEC issues further guidance on how firms should disclose cybersecurity risk factors, the findings of Ashraf (2021) suggests that firms will herd towards what the firms think the SEC wants them to disclose rather than disclosing risk factors that appropriately represent a firms cybersecurity risk.  Benefits of having a board member with information technology or cybersecurity expertise  Findings in Academic Research Ashraf, Michas, and Russomanno (2020)4 study the impact an audit committee information technology expert has on firms financial reporting quality. They find that firms with such experts have higher quality financial reporting, in part due to the expertise this board member brings to the table about cybersecurity.  Implications for New Proposed Rule  The findings of Ashraf et al. (2020) suggest that requiring a information technology or cybersecurity expert on the board may ultimately benefit shareholders. 3 Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3807487.  4 Available at https://meridian.allenpress.com/accounting review/article/95/5/23/431229/The Impact of Audit Committee Information. 4 The Eli Broad College of Business  Accounting and Information Systems  Michigan State University North Business Complex 632 Bogue Street, Rm N270 East Lansing, MI 48824 Phone: 517 355 7486 Fax: 517 432 1101 Accounting.broad.msu.edu  Spillover benefits of cyber incident disclosures  Findings in Academic Research Ashraf (2022)5 studies the spillover effects of data breaches. He documents that non breached firms enhance their cybersecurity after a peer firm has a data breach.  Implications for New Proposed Rule  To the extent that disclosure of a cyber incident via 8 K increases market wide news dissemination of that incident, the findings of Ashraf (2022) suggest that a spillover benefit of mandating these 8 K disclosures is that unaffected firms will see the negative peer news and enhance their own cybersecurity.  Concluding remarks  We hope the above referenced academic studies are able to provide helpful insights as the SEC debates whether and how to finalize its recent proposal regarding cybersecurity disclosures.  We are all available and happy to discuss these issues further.

USA  Re: FILE NUMBER S7 09 22 — COMMENTS ON CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT, STRATEGY, GOVERNANCE, AND INCIDENT DISCLOSURE  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Commission,  We are pleased to provide our comments on the proposed rules referenced in FILE NUMBER S7 09 22. We are a curated network of over 700 U.S. technology executives and corporate directors working exclusively on advancing leading boardroom policies and practices in cyber governance. We are the leader in advancing these issues in America as this was our founding mission when we launched in October of 2017. Our executive network includes CIOs, CISOs, CROs, and corporate directors from some of Americas leading public and private companies and boardrooms. Our opinions reﬂect the most developed perspective and body of work on cyber governance in America. PROPOSED AMENDMENT ITEM E: DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE ITEM 407 REGULATION S K  Together with the 700+ technology leaders who are DDN members we STRONGLY support this amendment and the changes it will introduce with Item 407(j) requiring disclosure of boardroom cyber expertise. The item E amendment is singularly the highest impact, lowest effort proposal being suggested that will materially lower cyber risk exposure for Americas public companies. Strengthening Americas boardrooms as a critical control point in cybersecurity is an issue of national security. This issue is also core to the competitiveness of American businesses and one squarely in the interest of investors and consumers. All other proposals in S7 09 22 will be strengthened through this foundational, common sense, overdue, and easily implementable boardroom reform. We would like to call the Commissions attention to the following general observations backing up our support for this amendment and our detailed answers to questions 26 37 that follow.  Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 2 The SOX Boardroom Financial Expertise Disclosure Precedent We call the Commissions attention to 2022 being the twentieth anniversary of The Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. As you know, a similar requirement concerning boardroom disclosure of ﬁnancial expertise was passed as a part of that legislation. In hindsight, it would be hard to argue against the presence of directors ﬁnancial expertise in Americas public company corporate boardrooms. I identiﬁed the synergies between SOX and the need for boardroom cyber expertise in an article I wrote for The Conference Board in 2016 titled Are Cyber Experts On Boards Inevitable?1 My conclusion from this article stated: Directors who do not have the ability to ask the right cybersecurity question, will never get the right answer. Cybersecurity governance ground zero starts in the American corporate boardroom with competent cybersecurity directors. Whether forced by regulators, pressured by activists, or added by a board that recognizes that good corporate governance needs cybersecurity competent directors, a decade from now, well look back in disbelief at what is today, the novel concept of having cybersecurity skills in the American corporate boardroom.  In 2012, after a decade of SOX, research from the SEC ﬁlings corporate governance database of Big 4 accounting ﬁrm EY observed that:  In 2003, only a small number of audit committee members were ﬁnancial experts. Today, almost one half of all audit committee members are identiﬁed through proxy statement disclosure as meeting the deﬁnition of a ﬁnancial expert.2  More narrowly, recruiting ﬁrm Spencer Stuart observed that for the companies in the S&P 500: In 2003 21 percent of boards reported having a ﬁnancial expert  146 ﬁnancial experts in total  versus 2012, when 100 percent of S&P 500 boards report having at least one ﬁnancial expert for a total of 1,096.3  The ﬁnancial expertise disclosure provision in SOX quickly and effectively infused boardroom accountability and competencies that positively and materially impacted the ﬁnancial reporting  1 Zukis, Bob.

In hindsight, it is difﬁcult to believe that it was only twenty years ago when it was a novel concept to have expertise in Americas boardrooms that understood a ﬁnancial statement. The time has now arrived to ﬁx the cyber expertise shortcoming in Americas boardrooms. Corporate directors not only need to ask the right questions on cyber risk, but they also need to understand the answers. While ﬁnancial and accounting concepts have been taught as a part of core higher education business curriculums for decades, it still took SOX to force boards to introduce the depth of this core competency into the corporate boardroom and governance system. Cybersecurity is not a core competency taught in most university business curriculums which makes it a much larger boardroom competency gap amongst the vast majority of Americas current cohort of corporate directors. Consequently, it must be expressly introduced into Americas corporate boardrooms which the proposed rule will efﬁciently do. Self regulatory practices that could have introduced cyber expertise into the boardroom have failed as only a small percentage of Americas boardrooms have voluntarily adopted this leading practice. However, boardroom cyber expertise precedent does exist from some of Americas leading companies such as FedEx, AIG, GM, Hasbro, Verisign, and some others. This emergent practice is early validation of the recognized need to strengthen this aspect of corporate governance. Holding corporate boards accountable with an easily implementable disclosure standard will positively and materially improve the cyber risk proﬁle of Americas public companies. This proposed rule will also create a positive spillover effect on Americas private companys boardroom cyber expertise. Something that occurred after SOX as a result of the boardroom ﬁnancial expertise disclosure rule for public companies. Without cyber expertise in the boardroom, the vast majority of Americas boardrooms are not capable of governing the signiﬁcant cyber risks threatening and impairing American business. The boardroom is a critical part of every companys overall system of cyber risk management. From setting the cyber tone at the top, to monitoring and advising management teams this competency needs to be a core and effective boardroom competency. We believe this proposed rule is a necessary, reasonable, and foundational corporate governance step that will quickly improve Americas cyber risk management posture. The precedent of requiring disclosure of ﬁnancial expertise in Americas corporate boardrooms materially improved the boardroom as a critical control in ﬁnancial reporting. This 2002 corporate governance reform strengthened Americas capital markets alongside the ﬁnancial and accounting management practices and policies of American companies. This type of boardroom reform has worked before in American corporate governance. It will work again to reduce cyber risk as cyber expertise is brought into Americas boardrooms.  Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 4  Adding Cyber Expertise in the Boardroom Will Strengthen Americas National Security and Economic Growth  Leading technology industry analyst IDC estimates that 65% of global GDP will be digitized in 20224. In 2019 the World Economic Forum also declared that 60% of global GDP would be digitized by 2022, contrasted with the statement that only 45% of people trust that technology will improve their lives5. Americas investors, consumers, and other corporate stakeholders deserve to know that the corporate boards governing the companies they invest in and do business with are competent to govern cyber risk at the senior most levels of the organization. As the most cyber attacked country in the world, Americas corporate governance weakness in cyber risk means Americas companies face signiﬁcantly higher levels of litigation, equity, and ﬁnancial risk than other companies worldwide. Without this proposed rule, this weakness will remain, all but guaranteeing that cyber attacks will not only continue but escalate. American companies will remain the preferred target of attackers which will impair economic growth and weaken national security. The emergence of systemic cyber risk also requires every American public and private company to strengthen their cyber governance, not just a few. Cyber risk that can start in one organization can rapidly move between companies as was experienced with the SolarWinds breach. Attackers are increasingly looking to exploit systemic cyber risk in this manner. This requires a far reaching and implementable approach to improving cyber governance for any American company, which we believe your proposed rule offers. Establishing cyber expertise as a leading practice in Americas public company boardrooms is a precedent that will spread to private companies. Effective corporate governance over any issue starts with the competencies of the corporate directors in the boardroom. We strongly urge the SEC to approve this proposed rule to strengthen cyber governance in the boardroom and secure Americas path toward the digital future.  Cyber Experts Will Strengthen The Entire Corporate Governance Agenda  There is often a misinformed perception that cyber experts are limited as boardroom contributors due to their technical acumen. A similar argument was made around ﬁnancial expertise twenty years ago with the ﬁnancial expertise disclosure requirement proposed with Sarbanes Oxley.  4 IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Digital Transformation Predictions 2021. (Framingham. IDC. October 2020). https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46967420 5 Our Shared Digital Future Responsible Digital Transformation  Board Brieﬁng. (Geneva. World Economic Forum. 2019). https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Responsible_Digital_Transformation.pdf  Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 5 While this will be true for some cyber experts, as it was for some ﬁnancial experts, it is not true for all of them. Many cyber experts are well rounded business executives who also happen to understand how to protect the vast sources of business value being created by todays and tomorrows information technologies. Our organization is the only one in the world that has been recruiting, developing, and training Americas leading technology executives for boardroom service. Over 700 members strong, many of these executives have also completed the worlds leading business school caliber boardroom readiness executive education program which was launched in 2019. Most of these executives are actively pursuing corporate directorship, and already have boardroom experience with their board, or frequently an external board. These boardroom and cyber experts have executive experience, boardroom experience, and demonstrated deep competencies as digital and cyber experts and would meet the suggested criteria for cyber expertise included in the proposed rule. Moreover, they have also been trained and certiﬁed on the DiRECTOR™ framework to understand and govern systemic risk in complex digital business systems. There exists today, a deep pool of boardroom ready, capable and willing cyber experts able to step into Americas corporate boardrooms. We have included comments to your speciﬁc questions below:  Question 26: Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would ﬁnd useful? Should it be modiﬁed in any way?  DDN Answer 26: It would be extremely useful for reasonable investors as it is a material disclosure of information critical to their assessment of business, ﬁnancial, and equity risk as it identiﬁes if the boardroom is a functioning control point in cyber risk management. The disclosure also sends a strong signal to potential attackers and sends a strong internal signal to the entire organization by establishing the cyber tone at the top of the organization. Question 27: Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)? Would a requirement to name such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving on a board of directors?  DDN Answer 27: Naming an individual is essential to establishing accountability and ensuring boardroom depth of cyber expertise. It will not dissuade true cyber experts from serving on a corporate board, which is also the reason why they should be named. There is a signiﬁcant difference in cyber expertise between a ﬁnance executive who sits on a cybersecurity companys board, and an executive who has been a cyber practitioner with formally acquired and applied competencies in cybersecurity. Absent the requirement to state a name, the former director would likely drive the undesired practice of deeming the rule to have been satisﬁed. However, the intent of the rule, and the need, is clearly to drive the presence of deep cyber expertise into the   Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 6 boardroom. The complexity of cyber risk and the rapidly changing nature of it warrants depth of cyber expertise, not casual familiarity with it. Those with an applied cyber background will not be dissuaded. Our 700 plus members are testament to this, they are willing, able, and ready to serve in the boardroom as named cyber experts. Question 28: When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors, should the registrant be stated expressly that this is the case under proposed Item 407(j)? As proposed, we would not require registrant to make such an explicit statement. DDN Answer 28: Yes, the absence of cyber expertise should be required as an explicit disclosure with the modiﬁcation of allowing an issuer greater latitude to comply or explain as is contemplated in proposed Senate Bill S. 808  The Cybersecurity Disclosure Bill of 2021.6 This draft Bill states that:  (2) if no member of the governing body of the reporting company has expertise or experience in cybersecurity, to describe what other aspects of the reporting companys cybersecurity were taken into account by any person, such as an official serving on a nominating committee, that is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for membership to the governing body.  As a core corporate governance principle, comply or explain allows issuers the latitude to address boardroom cyber expertise in multiple ways. Expanding the disclosure requirement to allow disclosure of other cybersecurity practices or policies would provide issuers the option to buy or rent cyber expertise in the boardroom. Buying reﬂects the addition of a director who is a functional cyber expert onto the board. This is a low cost, high impact solution that can be adopted in the short term. It will have a material impact on improving corporate governance and reducing cyber risk for the issuer. We are strong advocates for buying as building up equity in cyber risk governance will deliver the highest levels of long term cyber resiliency against the rapidly changing cyber threat landscape.  However, our suggested modiﬁcation would allow corporate boards the ﬂexibility to disclose how they rent cyber expertise from the many individuals or organizations who are immediately capable of providing boardroom and management advice on these issues. Actions that corporate boards can take in the short term, other than adding a director who is a cyber expert to their director ranks, include:  • Annual and regular executive education for the full board on cybersecurity governance and cyber risk. • Hiring ﬁrms or individuals who are third party cyber experts in a similar model of compensation consultants or external auditors that can advise, assess, and update the board on cyber risk and managements cyber risk practices, policies, and effectiveness.  6 Reed, Jack, et al. S. 808 Cybersecurity Disclosure Bill of 2021. 117th Congress (2021 2022). https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th congress/senate bill/808   Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 7  Question 29: Proposed Item 407(J) would require registrants to describe fully the nature of a board members expertise in cybersecurity without mandating speciﬁc disclosures. Is there particular information that we should instead require a registrant to disclose with respect to a board members expertise in cybersecurity?  DDN Answer 29: No, we do not believe that further prescriptive in depth disclosure of speciﬁc attributes of cyber expertise, e.g., job title, degree, is practical or warranted. Furthermore, we believe your suggested criteria exhibiting the applied competency base is adequate as it reﬂects the deep operational expectation of cyber competencies expected of a boardroom cyber expert. The debate that took place with ﬁnancial expertise addressed the issue of job titles, which was abandoned in the ﬁnal regulations and followed the path of allowing issuers the latitude to assess the demonstrated operational aptitude gained through formal education and application. This is the correct approach as it will allow issuers some ﬂexibility, and keep the candidate pool deep, while also allowing issuers to assess the ability of cyber experts more broadly as business experts and their capacity to contribute to the overall corporate governance agenda. It will avoid a check the box approach a prescriptive list of criteria may create. Question 30: As proposed, Item 407(J) includes a non exclusive list of criteria that a company should consider in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Are these factors for registrants to consider useful in determining cybersecurity expertise? Should the list be revised, eliminated, or supplemented?  DDN Answer 30: See DDN Answer 29. Question 31: Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants? If so, how?  DDN Answer 31: It would not impose an undue burden or cause undue negative consequences, quite the opposite. The proposed rule is lightweight and will strengthen all other proposed cyber rules. Moreover, it will strengthen both the boardroom as a cybersecurity control point in the organizations entire system of cybersecurity AND send powerful signals internally and externally that the senior most level of the business is cyber competent. Question 32: Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual statement and proxy report as proposed? DDN Answer 31: Yes, as this core cyber control is of interest to all stakeholders, as such, the distribution of the nature of its presence should be as wide as possible in an annual statement and proxy.  Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 8 Question 33: To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 407(j) overlap with disclosure required under Item 401(e) of Regulation S K with respect to the business experience of directors? Are there alternative approaches that would avoid duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors?  DDN Answer 33: We believe it would overlap very little. Cybersecurity expertise is not currently a widely tracked speciﬁc corporate director area of expertise on internal or external director competency matrices. We believe in practice Item 407(j) would enhance 401(e) business experience disclosures to identify other corporate directors with executive or operational depth in cybersecurity, which would only provide additional valuable information to investors. Question 34: A proposed Item 407(j) does not include a deﬁnition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) deﬁne the term expertise? If so, how should we deﬁne the term? DDN Answer 34: No, we believe the suggestions made are sufﬁcient as they are focused on applied cyber experience criteria and formally acquired knowledge through structured learning, and/or applied learning in the context of being a cybersecurity practitioner. See DDN Answer 29. Question 35: Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants?  DDN Answer 35: Absolutely no exclusions should be made because of the growth of systemic risk. Smaller issuers present a unique systemic challenge to larger companies as attackers can exploit their lesser developed cybersecurity management practices to target larger companies. A strong system of cybersecurity for Americas public companies requires that they all adopt the most basic cybersecurity policies and practices, which Item 407(j) represents. Exclusions will introduce speciﬁc weaknesses that can be targeted and exploited, which will create greater risk for the excluded along with the larger issuers through this systemic attack vector. Leaving a weak point in the highly connected nature of the American business ecosystem invites targeted escalation. Item 407(j) must cover every issuer, otherwise, its effectiveness as a key cybersecurity control is defeated for all issuers. Each issuer is only as strong as the weakest link in their connected ecosystem, the proposal needs to cover all issuers for this reason. Question 36: Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identiﬁed as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identiﬁcation. Are there alternatives we should consider? DDN Answer 36: Yes, this should be adopted to explicitly address the director liability concern of cyber experts taking these roles, as many of them will be ﬁrst time directors. It will reassure them   Bob Zukis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 310.528.9945  ceo@digitaldirectors.network www.digitaldirectors.network Chicago | Los Angeles 9 to attract as large of a candidate pool as possible and alleviate any concerns here while also alerting all corporate directors to their shared responsibility and accountability to this issue. Question 37: As proposed, disclosure under Item 407(j) would be required in a proxy or information statement. Should we require the disclosure under Item 407(J) to appear in a registrants proxy or information statement regardless of whether the registrant is relying on General Instruction G(3)? Is this information relevant to a security holders decision to vote for a particular director?  DDN Answer 37: Yes, it is very relevant to individual director votes for an investor, particularly institutional investors. Cyber risk is a risk with business continuity implications that have material ﬁnancial and equity risk implications not just to the organization, but to connected ecosystem partners given the growing threat of systemic risk. As such, directors who are cyber experts should be explicitly identiﬁed in the proxy or information statement. In summary, we reiterate our strong support for the broader proposal, especially Item E, and are pleased to provide our comments. Weve already been working to advance this issue over the last ﬁve years and our support and comments come from our depth of experience and informed insights on this issue. We are Americas leader in digital and cyber risk governance, and your proposal has the strong support of the more than 700 technology and cyber leaders who are our members.  Americas investors, consumers, and stakeholders expect and deserve the companies they do business with to have cyber competent boardrooms highly capable of governing these complex issues. In hindsight, this proposed rule once passed into law, will be looked upon as a turning point and common sense regulation that materially advanced Americas national security and the competitiveness of American business. Thank you for your attention and please contact me if you would like to discuss these views. Sincerely,  Bob Zukis CEO, Digital Directors Network",3

Washington, D.C. 20549  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure; 17 CFR Parts 229, 232, 239, 240, and 249; [Release Nos. 33 11038; 34 94382; IC 34529; File No. S7 09 22] https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf Dear Ms. Countryman: I respectfully submit this comment letter in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the Commission) proposed rules.   If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails… Silvan S. Tomkins, Princeton University from the conference paper collection Computer Simulation of Personality: Frontier of Psychological Theory, in Chapter 1, Page 8, presented June 1962. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail. Abraham H. Maslow, The Psychology of Science, page 15, 1966  Summary The proposed cyber security rules are like a hammer looking for a nail.  • The proposed rules apply the hammer  methods of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)  to the nail of cyber security and warfare o Considering cybersecurity to be a nail like ICFR is a category error and structural flaw  o It is a category error and structural flaw because ICFR is a linear stable system o In sharp contrast, cyber security and warfare are complex dynamic and more adversarial systems • The risk assessment heavy approach reinforces this error because its emphasis is outward, rather than balanced with the internal system o In ICFR this might be a reasonable assumption because the system is linear and stable o In cyber security and warfare, this assumption is false • The proposed paperwork based approach may work for ICFR. But a paperwork based approach cannot: o Create a winning restaurant or sports team o Cause world leaders to acknowledge the threat of Putins aggression before he attacked o Strengthen cyber security  it has harmed cyber security In revising the proposed rules, it would be helpful to reconsider the objective.  • By way of analogy to Putins aggression, is the objective to enable litigation against the Biden Administration for failing to convince world leaders to do more to deter Putin? Or is the purpose to shape the conditions to make it as easy as possible for the Biden Administration to do everything possible for global security? • In cyber security and warfare, the opportunity is to encourage the use of Critical Thinking, Systems Thinking, Design Thinking and Zero Trust strategies to make companies more secure to contribute to national and global security • If the proposed rules are not revised, then they would become the root cause of incidents and breaches After an explanation of this summary, resources are provided on how the proposed rules can be revised by taking advantage of how Critical Thinking, Systems Thinking, Design Thinking and Zero Trust strategies are already used in the U.S. Government and beyond. Managing risk is all about understanding the system Successfully managing risk requires 1) thoroughly understanding how it works  the nature of the system, 2) discovering the real problem, 3) asking, What if? 4) to solve the real problem. This is fundamental to systems thinking and applies from cooking to driving a car through a storm to ice skating to kinetic warfare to new products management to forestry.  The integrity of information reported to the SECs EDGAR system is entirely different from cyber security and warfare. • Financial reporting is about reasonable assurance of the accuracy of the financial consequences of tangible transactions (e.g., payment for raw materials) that happened in the past in a linear, stable system  general ledger. A high end threat is detecting fraud or a bribe paid. Debates about accounting treatments happen within the confines of rules and professional guidance. Errors and omissions are addressed with routine methods. Thus, confidence in error ranges and predictability are relatively high.  • Cyber security and warfare are about managing risk in unfolding situations in a complex dynamic system in an unpredictable, emerging future. Cybersecurity is more adversarial. High end threats include disabling a power grid, contaminating water supplies, halting logistics, or turning off infusion pumps in hospitals. While scenarios can be imagined using creative, film script style methods and wargaming, a company faces an emerging future as do President Biden and world leaders facing Putins aggressive war. Law enforcement revelations about hacking gangs like LAPSUS$ reinforce the nature of the system and the future.  In short, because of these differences in the nature of the system, it would be a structural flaw and the wrong tool for the job to apply linear stable system methods to a complex dynamic and highly adversarial system. Consequences of the proposed rules  a category error The proposed rules use the term controls broadly. While control can be applied in many senses, simplifying here into just two. • Those in the accounting tradition previously termed checks that are to do lists with origins in ancient Egyptian grain accounting. They are best for linear, repetitive tasks. They are the nature of the policies and procedures disclosures listed in the proposed rules, beginning on page 12. • Those in the mechanical/automated tradition, with origins in ancient animal traps now found in steam engines, air conditioning, consumer electronics, avionics and more. These are designed with specific ranges, tolerances and service lifetimes  look at the back of your laptop power supply.  Reliability and use are strikingly different, especially in the complex dynamic system of cybersecurity. For example, please see the CISA page for the SolarWinds compromise https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/remediating apt compromised networks. To better understand the mechanical/automated approach in the context of systems for cybersecurity, please see https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800 160/vol 1/final  More, the ICFR approach defocuses and distracts from actions to strengthen security and reduce business losses.  Consider a restaurant. It could have the most hygienic kitchen. It could have the finest ingredients  far beyond certification standards for organic. It could have the happiest staff. Yet will those actions cause a 5 star rating across the categories of presentation, experience and taste of food? Consider further: • Does the method for checking the cash box at a sporting event make a team win? • Does the method for checking for a pilots hotel bill make a safe flight? • Does the method for checking the cash box at a circus ensure animal welfare?  More, consider the structural flaw of applying ICFR based methods of managing risk to cyber security and warfare.  • By that same logic would the SEC apply ICFR based methods to other business disciplines  new product management, marketing, logistics or IT systems response time on Black Friday. Those disciplines have decades of proven and practical math and methods.  • By that same logic would the SEC apply ICFR based methods to all aspects of a business  including industrial operations and transportation? Would it override the guidance of the CSB or NTSB for public companies and replace that guidance with ICFR based methods?  Creating causes of action or solving the real problem? More, the proposed rules would reinforce an error in the application of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Too often, ICFR based methods used for the linear, stable system of financial reporting are applied to the complex dynamic system of cyber security and warfare. Too often, the root cause of an incident is bad math and method used by the cybersecurity team  often based on ICFR based methods. The proposed rules could be construed to legitimize those common errors.  The paperwork nature of the proposed rules gives rise to problems: Paperwork is not always bad. Aviation, medical procedures, auto repair and more have detailed documentation. But those are for linear tasks. Flight safety or military success in complex dynamic systems comes from thinking and practice  flight simulators or years of experience in tumor removal. The crash of Air France Flight 447 is a tragic reminder.  The focus on paperwork  policies, procedures and assessments  over solving the real problem… • Defocuses from understanding the nature of the system and solving the real problem • Causes companies to reach for the SECs preferred tools rather than the right tools • Causes companies to double down on what they perceive will protect from enforcement actions and private causes of action, rather than what improves security for customers, employees and the United States Consider the error of focusing on risk assessments instead of focusing on understanding the nature of the system and how it works. Reflect on this winters snowstorms that clogged freeways and electric vehicles that lost power on those freeways becoming roadblocks. The owners failed to understand the limitation of the system that was their car.  The proposed rules cite the NIST Risk Management Framework, without realizing that the Framework (which isnt a framework as it is not comprehensive) states However, the variety of ways in which the Framework can be used by an organization means that phrases like compliance with the Framework can be confusing. The cumulative effect of this path would be to create vulnerabilities that become incidents that become breaches. In sum, the errors and flaws would put the SEC at the root cause of incidents. This is the opposite of the objectives of the Biden Administration.  Regarding cybersecurity expertise on boards of directors, the real question is, What expertise? • If it is more ICFR based expertise, then that would reinforce the structural flaw of using ICFR based methods for cyber security and warfare. It would also reinforce the problem of having cybersecurity overseen by audit committees.  • All board members should be encouraged to bring their personal and professional backgrounds in critical thinking, systems thinking and design thinking to best oversee and guide management in creating authentic Zero Trust strategies. For more on Zero Trust, please see https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Final%20Draft%20NSTAC%20Report%20t o%20the%20President%20on%20Zero%20Trust%20and%20Trusted%20Identity%20Managemen t.pdf Many disciplines include design thinking and systems and root cause analysis  cooking, information technology, architecture, biology and assembly line design. Board members should be encouraged to bring their whole self experience in root cause analysis and design expertise to cybersecurity discussions  not feel excluded.  • The expert needs to bring strength in critical thinking, systems thinking and design thinking  especially in a technology context  to draw out the strengths of other board members and guide the asking of smart questions of management to improve company and national security.  References for proposed rule revisions  Alternative approaches are available to the SEC. The references below are to critical thinking, systems thinking and design thinking as used elsewhere in U.S. Government. Some references are in the context of cybersecurity and some are other complex dynamic systems where these approaches have been successful. The point is that these thinking types apply to complex dynamic systems that are the environment of cyber security and warfare. This is more effective than the assumption in the proposed rules of an ICFR like linear stable system. With these approaches to thinking, the SEC can revise the proposed rules to be less likely to cause vulnerabilities and breaches in regulated companies. Using approaches appropriate to complex dynamic and highly adversarial systems would avoid the error of applying ICFR based methods that are only appropriate for linear stable systems.

Chevron is one of the worlds leading integrated energy companies. Through its subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide, the Company is involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry.  Chevron supports the Commissions goals of improving the availability of consistent, comparable, and decision useful disclosures by public companies about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices. For the reasons we discuss further in this letter, we are concerned that certain aspects of the Proposing Release would not satisfy this objective and would instead provide information to investors that is not decision useful, while creating security concerns for registrants.  Current disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K Materiality trigger and associated safeguards  Chevron agrees with the Commission that companies should not be required to report cybersecurity incidents prior to managements determination of their materiality.1 The substantial majority of cyber threats against companies do not have significant impact, and disclosure of such incidents, versus those identified as material, would inundate investors with inconsequential information.  The Company also supports the Commissions proposed approach to include Form 8 K Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors. Given the stealth nature of cybersecurity incidents, the proposed strict timing requirements of Form 8 K Item 1.05, and the related materiality determinations required, there is increased risk that the question of whether a material cybersecurity incident disclosure was timely made under proposed Item 1.05, as well as managements materiality determination itself, would be second guessed and potentially challenged by investors and others.  We believe that the foregoing considerations, coupled with the proposed requirement to make a materiality determination for an incident as soon as reasonably practicable after its discovery, warrant safe harbor protection. For the same reasons, the Company supports the Commissions proposed approach  1 We refer to the traditional materiality standard anchored in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 232 (1988). Vanessa A. Countryman May 6, 2022 Page 2  that the failure to timely file a Form 8 K under Item 1.05 would not result in the loss of the registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3. The Company further encourages the Commission to permit registrants to furnish, rather than requiring them to file, an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Consistent with statements of a former Co Director of the Division of Enforcement, we also ask for the Commissions final rule to recognize this is a complex area subject to significant judgment, and [the Commission is] not looking to second guess reasonable, good faith disclosure decisions.2 In addition, the Company believes a safe harbor should be available for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting systems used but not owned by a registrant. Although the terms of such arrangements generally require the third party service provider to implement security measures, registrants, including Chevron, may not have ready access to information about cybersecurity incidents affecting third party systems, including the fact that an incident has occurred, that would be necessary to assess materiality. We believe any safe harbor for third party systems should still require registrants to assess materiality to the registrant of any known cybersecurity incident affecting the third party system that the registrant uses. Otherwise, investors would not receive potentially material information about cybersecurity risks or exposures from registrants that use public cloud services or other third party systems.  Reporting delay when there is cooperation with law enforcement or other government agencies, ransomware involved, or an ongoing internal investigation that would be jeopardized  We urge the Commission to consider a revision to the proposed rule to allow an exception that permits additional time to report a cybersecurity incident in certain circumstances. Such delay may be warranted when a registrant is cooperating with or taking directions from law enforcement or other government agencies in connection with the incident. These circumstances include, for example, when a registrant is cooperating with law enforcement to assist in the apprehension of the perpetrators of a cybersecurity incident, negotiating with a threat actor to recover critical corporate assets affected by a ransomware attack, or conducting an internal investigation (particularly at the stage of the investigation where disclosing details of a cyber incident externally may increase the companys vulnerability to malicious acts or exploitation while the incident has not been fully remediated). In these circumstances, a premature disclosure of the incident may put at risk the companys ongoing efforts to detect the wrongdoers, recover corporate assets, or block harmful cyber activity against the company through exploitation of an identified vulnerability, which ultimately would harm investors.  Further, the required timeline for proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05 disclosure may undermine other government agencies efforts to address cybersecurity attacks. For example, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, enacted in March 2022, requires owners and operators of critical infrastructure to report certain cyber incidents to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours after an incident is reasonably confirmed, and any ransomware payments within 24 hours after the payment is made. These disclosure rules are intended in part to allow CISA and other agencies to gather information about the incidents and distribute security alerts if they involve vulnerabilities that pose risks to other companies. Notably, to our knowledge, no state or federal law requires public disclosure of a cyber incident immediately or shortly after its discovery. Forcing early market disclosure of a cyber incident, such as those contemplated by the  2 See The SEC Enforcement Divisions Initiatives Regarding Retail Investor Protection and Cybersecurity (October 26, 2017), available at https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech avakian 2017 10 26.  Vanessa A. Countryman May 6, 2022 Page 3  proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05, may undermine other government agencies efforts to address and protect critical infrastructure. Content of proposed Form 8 K Item 1.05 Chevron believes the scope of the proposed contents of Form 8 K Item 1.05 should remain limited to general information, as proposed, and not include specific or technical information or other details that may impede the registrants response or remediation of the incident, such as the list of vendors the registrant is using, the identity of the actor, or the origin of the attack. Beyond complicating incident response, detailed information regarding an incident would not provide additional benefit to investors. Disclosure of updates about material cybersecurity incidents on Forms 10 Q and 10 K Regarding the requirement in the Proposing Release to determine whether a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents have become material in the aggregate, the Proposing Releases description of such aggregation appears vague and difficult to operationalize. For instance, under the proposed requirement, it is not clear whether a registrant should aggregate the same types of incidents, multiple incidents from the same attacker, attacks across different geographies, or attacks within a specific timeframe. Further, it is unclear how such aggregated information would be beneficial to investors understanding of a registrants business and cybersecurity risk management. The SECs provision of additional guidance and parameters on the proposed aggregation requirement would help registrants comply and promote consistent disclosure standards for the benefit of investors.  Disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance Chevron believes that the broad scope of disclosure requirements under proposed Regulation S K Items 106(b) and 106(c) would result in lengthy disclosures that are not necessarily useful to investors but could serve as a roadmap for potential cyber attackers. Any disclosure requirements with respect to registrants policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks should be narrowly tailored to require a high level overview rather than specific details of registrants cybersecurity programs. For example, in response to Question 20 of the Proposing Release, registrants should not be required to identify the third party entities they use, including any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service providers. We do not believe such information would be decision useful for investors, particularly for large companies that rely on different third party service providers for each major project or joint venture. Moreover, certain third party services, such as those based on open source software, might be virtually impossible to trace or disclose in an easily understandable format. Similarly, in response to Question 22 of the Proposing Release, the details of the registrants incident response processes and techniques, including specific tools, should not be required to be disclosed. Such information could offer a roadmap to potential attackers, in which case the potential harm would clearly outweigh the benefits to investors. Regarding the proposed definitions under Regulation S K Item 106(a), these definitions should be consistent with existing comparable definitions used under other federal laws and regulations, to the extent a comparable definition is available, such as the definition of cybersecurity incident found in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework or the definition of incident found in NIST Special Publication 800 37, Appendix B. We also believe the proposed definition of cybersecurity threat should be refined with more parameters, including a probability threshold, as certain terms in the proposed definition (such as any potential occurrence and may result in) do not provide instructive boundaries. In addition, we urge the Commission to define the operational Vanessa A. Countryman May 6, 2022 Page 4  technology systems that can cause material cybersecurity incidents in certain industries.3 The proposed definitions understandably focus on data breaches, which are a major cybersecurity threat, but we believe an operational technology breach could have even more detrimental effects in certain cases (such as for ransomware attacks that have impacted critical infrastructure) and warrants disclosure guidance from the Commission. * * * We hope our comments are helpful to the Commission in determining next steps for this proposed rule.

We support the Commissions objective of enhancing and standardizing disclosures that registrants make about cybersecurity incidents and their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. Currently, cybersecurity threats and incidents pose an ongoing risk to public companies, investors and market participants. We support the Commissions efforts to require companies to make robust and timely disclosures about material cybersecurity incidents. We offer the following observations and recommendations on the proposal. Use of materiality for reporting cybersecurity incidents  Consistent with our views in previous comment letters,1 we support using materiality as defined by the Supreme Court as the primary consideration for determining whether a disclosure is required, and we therefore support using materiality to determine whether and when registrants should disclose cybersecurity incidents in the proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K and in periodic reports. We observe, and the proposing release acknowledges, that cybersecurity incidents vary in nature and complexity, and registrants have different levels of preparedness and resources to investigate and analyze such incidents. As such, we believe that using materiality as the trigger for disclosure should allow registrants to communicate more effectively to investors information that is relevant and focused on each registrants facts and circumstances.  1 Refer to our comment letter on Modernization of Regulation S K Items 101, 103, and 105 (Release No. 33 10668; 34 86614; File No. S7 11 19)  Page 2 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Securities and Exchange Commission To determine whether a cybersecurity incident is material, registrants would need to evaluate the total mix of information, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances of the incident, including both quantitative and qualitative factors. We observe that materiality assessments in the context of cybersecurity incidents are often complex, and registrants of all sizes may struggle to perform them. However, we note that many companies have followed the SECs recommendation to establish disclosure committees that consider the materiality of information, and they could be involved in this assessment. 2 To help registrants make these assessments, we recommend that the final rule include the examples on page 24 and page 25 of the proposing release or other examples, including ones that address incidents that may be qualitatively material. We considered whether the Commission should require registrants to perform the materiality assessment required by the proposed rules within a certain time period to try to drive timeliness, consistency and comparability of these disclosures. For the same reasons discussed above related to the nature of cybersecurity incidents and registrants relative levels of preparedness to assess them, we do not believe that setting a deadline to perform a materiality assessment is necessary. We observe that the proposed rules require a registrant to disclose the date the incident was discovered, so it would be clear to investors and other market participants how long a registrant took to determine that an incident is material. If the SEC does not want to give registrants an indefinite period of time to provide disclosure, it could require registrants to disclose cybersecurity incidents that they are still assessing for materiality in periodic reports (i.e., Forms 10 Q and 10 K) for the period in which a cybersecurity incident occurred. The level of disclosure for these incidents could be less than what would be required for incidents that a registrant concludes are material. Disclosure of cybersecurity incidents that have become material in the aggregate  We believe that one of the more challenging aspects of the proposed rules would be complying with the requirement for registrants to make disclosures about cybersecurity incidents in periodic reports when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents become material in the aggregate. The proposed rules, as drafted, may not be operational. To comply with them, registrants would have to inventory immaterial incidents over an undefined time period, continually update the list, assess the aggregate materiality of the incidents and be prepared to disclose information about them when they become material in the aggregate. In some cases, we believe cybersecurity incidents would be unrelated or occur so far apart (e.g., more than a year apart) that it would not be reasonable to aggregate them and would not provide useful information to investors. To simplify the proposed rules and make them more operational, we recommend that the Commission consider requiring registrants to only aggregate cybersecurity incidents that are related, which we believe is consistent with the example on page 34 of the proposing release. We note this would be consistent with the disclosure requirements for aggregating related business acquisitions. We believe a clear definition of related cybersecurity incidents in the amendments would help registrants consistently apply the definition and provide meaningful disclosure to investors. Related cybersecurity incidents could be defined to include attacks on the same systems, processes or controls of a registrant  2 The SEC final rule, Certification of Disclosure in Companies Quarterly and Annual Reports Page 3 Ms. Vanessa Countryman Securities and Exchange Commission over a specified period of time. The SEC could consider providing an example that clarifies that a registrant that suffers a series of cybersecurity attacks over the course of a month from one malicious actor should consider those incidents related cybersecurity incidents.  Matters related to the presentation of disclosures To avoid duplicative disclosures, we support the use of hyperlinks and cross references in filings, including in proposed Item 106 and Item 407(j). However, we believe that current SEC rules3 already permit the use of cross referencing and hyperlinks in the same filing outside of the financial statements so explicitly allowing that in these rules is unnecessary. We believe the SEC should instead confirm in the adopting release that its existing rules allow registrants to use cross references and hyperlinks in Item 407(h) and Item 401(e) disclosures to avoid repeating disclosures. We support the proposed requirement that registrants use Inline XBRL tagging for cybersecurity disclosures to enable automated extraction and analysis of granular data required by the proposed rules. We believe this would allow investors and other market participants to more efficiently perform large scale analysis and compare registrants disclosures over time.  * * * * * We would be pleased to discuss our comments with the Commission or its staff at its convenience.

(BitSight) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (Commission) proposed rule on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies. We commend the Commission for its attention and focus on this critical issue impacting the investor community and market participants.  Cybersecurity is a critical risk that can materially impact a companys long term value and sustainability, and increased disclosure will improve the ability of investors and other market participants to assess and price cyber risk. We concur with the Commission that investors would benefit from more timely, consistent and informative disclosure about cybersecurity risks and incidents; further detail about the cyber risk management practices adopted by, and threats facing, individual companies; and additional information about the cybersecurity experience and qualifications of a companys board of directors. Unfortunately, there are instances where investors today may be in the dark when it comes to understanding the cybersecurity risk posture of the companies in which they invest. Indeed, the frequency and substance of companies disclosures related to cybersecurity investment, policy, and readiness can vary greatly.1 Moreover, significant cybersecurity incidents are not always  1 Recent BitSight research published on March 29, 2022 supports the Audit Analytics analysis referenced by the Commission regarding delays associated with cyber incident disclosures. BitSight analyzed more than 12,000 publicly disclosed cybersecurity incidents from 2019 2022 and found that it takes organizations 105 days to discover and disclose an incident from the date the incident occurred; discovery takes 46 days, disclosure takes 59 days after discovery. This research is available at: https://www.bitsight.com/blog/months minutes can new regulations accelerate cyber incident disclosure process  2 broadly publicly disclosed, and any disclosures that are provided can lack critical information that would be useful for investors to make informed decisions.2 BitSight is a company dedicated to helping investors and other market participants tackle the significant and dynamic challenge of understanding cybersecurity risk. In 2011, BitSight created the worlds first cybersecurity rating system and has since partnered with many of the worlds leading investment organizations including Moodys, Glass Lewis, IHS Markit, and others to improve investor and market awareness of cyber risks. BitSight produces daily security ratings and analytics that provide real time information across a variety of cybersecurity risk factors. BitSight measures the cybersecurity posture of a company based on continuous, non intrusive data collection of an organizations cybersecurity performance — the ability of the measured organization to remediate cybersecurity findings quickly and effectively and on an ongoing basis. By synthesizing complex cybersecurity risk into quantitative ratings and analytics, BitSight provides the marketplace with critical, timely and comparable insight into organizational cyber performance, helping to address historic information asymmetry challenges and self disclosure biases without increasing the vulnerability of the rated entity. Thousands of investors, enterprises, insurers, government institutions and other market stakeholders trust BitSights independent ratings and data to make better risk management decisions. Because of its global, Internet wide scale, BitSight ratings currently cover all publicly traded U.S. companies. Based on its extensive experience in the industry, BitSight believes that the new disclosure requirements envisioned by the Commission will allow both investors and companies to benefit from more standardized, timely, consistent and informative disclosure about cybersecurity risks and incidents. We urge the Commission to move forward with these requirements for the benefit of investors and other market participants. Some comments follow on specific questions asked in the Commissions proposal.  In response to Questions #17 and #50 regarding cyber risk management, strategy and governance disclosure, we recommend expanding the proposed narrative disclosure requirements to include quantitative, objective, risk based metrics and measurements of a registrants cybersecurity program. Our experience is that investors value quantitative, objective metrics and measurements regarding cybersecurity performance and outcomes. Security performance metrics help investors assess the effectiveness of the policies, controls, governance and procedures that a company is implementing, providing investors greater visibility into how well the cyber risk program is being executed. Security performance measurements also provide investors with further validation of managements intentions. 2 See Exhibit 2 of the Moodys Sector In Depth Report, SEC disclosure rules would improve transparency of cyber risk management, April 28, 2022. Research available at:  https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1323591 3  There are numerous examples of companies today disclosing relevant, detailed information on cybersecurity program performance for specific incidents as well as general risk disclosure, and directly benefiting from this transparency in the marketplace; illustratively:  ● In 2019, Norsk Hydro was the victim of a ransomware attack that impacted operations. The companys response to the incident — which included a press conference featuring corporate executives, frequent, data rich updates on the corporate blog, an engaged and knowledgeable leadership team, and sound financial estimates in quarterly filings — was widely praised by the market for providing timely, relevant information.3 Notably, Norsk Hydro shared information about its cybersecurity program (including information about network segmentation, backup systems, and operational status), insurance coverage and the estimated total financial impact of the cyber attack in quarterly filings following the incident.4  ● Following its severe breach in 2017, Equifax Inc. made significant investments in its cybersecurity program and began reporting on its changes. Beginning in 2020 and again in 2021, Equifax published the Equifax Security Annual Report, a public document that includes key security metrics and performance indicators that describe the state of the Equifax cybersecurity program.5 Beyond describing the initiatives undertaken by the organization, the Equifax Security Annual Report details metrics and key results in key areas such as cloud security and supply chain assessments, security maturity benchmarking, and security performance benchmarking. These types of quantitative security indicators provide valuable validation for stakeholders that the Equifax security program is performing effectively, without creating new vulnerability to the company.  BitSight believes that all organizations should be similarly transparent about their cybersecurity program performance and results. Disclosure of risk based performance metrics — including cybersecurity ratings created by independent, objective third parties — will provide investors access to appropriate and expanded information to make more informed decisions.  As to Questions #1 and #2, BitSight supports the overall aim of bolstering cybersecurity incident reporting. We would further suggest requiring companies to provide specific information about  3 See Experts praise Norsk Hydro cyberattack response, March 20, 2019, available at: https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252459949/Experts praise Norsk Hydro cyberattack response  4 See Norsk Hydro Q3 2019 press release, available at: https://www.hydro.com/en DE/media/news/2019/third quarter 2019 ramping up production in brazil declining market prices/  5 Equifax Security Annual Report, 2020 available at: https://assets.equifax.com/newsroom/2020 security annual report.pdf  Equifax Security Annual Report, 2021 available at: https://assets.equifax.com/marketing/US/assets/2021 security annual report.pdf 4 the nature of the incident to better inform investors and improve research efforts, which may in turn help prevent future incidents. Specifically, BitSight recommends:  ● Disclosure of an incident should include whether the incident was originally detected by the company (or a contracted service provider) or by a third party, for example, law enforcement, government agencies, customers, journalists, or security researchers. Including this information will help partition incident disclosures into two broad categories: (a) self detected, and (b) externally detected. Understanding how the incident was detected will help investors, regulators, and other interested parties comparatively determine the effectiveness of the companys security policies, program, and controls.  As to Questions #17 and #20, we believe adding more specific risk disclosures covering key cybersecurity practices would help investors, credit analysts, regulators, and customers gain a deeper understanding of individual company cybersecurity posture and offer a mechanism for comparing companies that are regulated by the Commission. As examples, we encourage the Commission to consider the following, particularly with respect to Proposed Item 106(b):  ● Disclosure regarding the last time that specific independent security assessments and testing were conducted by the company. Granularity of this requirement would need to be considered but could include requiring disclosure of whether an application penetration test, red team exercise, or security control program assessment was performed in the previous calendar year. The resulting disclosure will help investors determine whether or not the company is seeking outside help in assessing its security defenses on a periodic basis.  ● Disclosure about the reporting line of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent individual in the organization would help investors and other interested parties determine whether the CISO has enough visibility at senior leadership levels. ● Disclosure of whether the CISO participates in some form of executive session on at least an annual basis with one or more board members, such as the chair of the Risk or Audit Committee, would further illuminate which companies are considering the independence of the CISO and associated security decision making.  Finally, with respect to Questions #5 and #8, we believe it would be prudent for the Commission to further clarify its definition of materiality for purposes of reporting cybersecurity incidents in order to avoid wide latitude for interpretation and corresponding uneven thresholds for disclosure. By providing updated guidance, the Commission can reduce the likelihood that events which should otherwise be reported remain undisclosed. We also believe the Commission should consider whether financial benchmarks, e.g., percentage of revenue, can be used to help determine materiality, and that it would be worthwhile to engage industry experts among the cybersecurity and financial community for further input. 5 In conclusion, we applaud the Commissions approach and appreciate the opportunity to comment on this critical initiative to improve investor understanding and market transparency for corporate cyber risk and incidents. We at BitSight stand ready to support your efforts.  Sincerely, Stephen Harvey Chief Executive Officer BitSight Technologies, Inc.",2

Countryman, Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549 1090  Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Incident Disclosure  File Number S7 09 22  Dear Ms. Countryman:  On March 23, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published proposed rules entitled Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure.1 This letter constitutes the Office of Advocacys (Advocacy) public comments on the proposed rules. The proposed rules will enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).2 The proposed rule would amend Regulation S K,3 Regulation S T,4 the Securities Act of 1933,5 and the Exchange Act. The proposed amendments would require registrants to provide current and periodic reporting of material cybersecurity incidents and periodic disclosures about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.  Advocacy supports SECs effort to analyze the impact that the proposed rules would have on small businesses in an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). However, based upon feedback received from small business representatives and on our internal analysis of the proposed rules, Advocacy is concerned that the IRFA lacks essential information required under  1 87 Fed. Reg. 16590, March 23, 2022. 2 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq. 3 17 CFR §§ 229.10 229.1305. 4 17 CFR §§ 232.10 232.903. 5 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq. 2  the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).6 Specifically, the IRFA does not adequately describe the costs of the proposed amendments on small entities, nor does it set forth significant alternatives which accomplish the stated SEC objectives and which minimize the significant economic impact of the proposal on small entities. For these reasons, Advocacy recommends that the SEC republish a Supplemental IRFA for public comment before proceeding with this rulemaking. I. Background A. The Office of Advocacy Congress established the Office of Advocacy under Pub. L. 94 305 to represent the views of small entities before Federal agencies and Congress. Advocacy is an independent office within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). As such the views expressed by Advocacy do not necessarily reflect the views of the SBA or the Administration. The RFA, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA),7 gives small entities a voice in the rulemaking process. For all rules that are expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the RFA requires federal agencies to assess the impact of the proposed rule on small entities and to consider less burdensome alternatives.  The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 requires agencies to give every appropriate consideration to comments provided by Advocacy.8 The agency must include a response to these written comments in any explanation or discussion accompanying the final rules publication in the Federal Register, unless the agency certifies that the public interest is not served by doing so.9  Advocacys comments are consistent with Congressional intent underlying the RFA, that [w]hen adopting regulations to protect the health, safety, and economic welfare of the nation, federal agencies should seek to achieve statutory goals as effectively and efficiently as possible without imposing unnecessary burdens on the public.10 B. The Proposed Rules On March 23, 2022, SEC published a notice of proposed rulemaking on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure in the Federal Register.11 SEC is promulgating proposed regulations to require public companies subject to the Exchange Act to do the following:  1) Disclose information about cybersecurity incidents within four business days after a registrant determines that it has experienced such an incident.12 6 5 U.S.C. § 601 et seq. 7 Pub. L. 104 121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) (codified in various sections of 5 U.S.C. §601 et seq.). 8 Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (PL. 111 240) §1601. 9 Id. 10 Id. 11 87 FR 16590. 12 87 FR 16595. 3  2) Provide updated disclosure relating to previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents.13  3) Require disclosure when a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents has become material in the aggregate.14  4) Require disclosure of a registrants policies and procedures for managing cybersecurity risks, its cybersecurity governance, and managements role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.15  5) Require disclosure about whether any member of a registrants board of directors has cybersecurity expertise.16  6) Require foreign private issuers to provide cybersecurity disclosures in annual reports consistent with the disclosure required in domestic forms.17  7) Require that the proposed disclosures be provided in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (Inline XBRL).18 In the IRFA, SEC estimated that there were 669 small entities (660 issuers and 9 business development companies19) that would be subject to the proposed amendments as of June 2021.20 II. Advocacys Small Business Concerns Advocacy has two chief concerns with the IRFA contained in the proposed rules. Under the RFA, an IRFA must contain: 1) A description of the reasons why the regulatory action is being taken.  2) The objectives and legal basis for the proposed regulation. 3) A description and estimated number of regulated small entities. 4) A description and estimate of compliance requirements, including any differential for different categories of small entities. 5) Identification of duplication, overlap, and conflict with other rules and regulations. 6) A description of significant alternatives to the rule.21 First, Advocacy is concerned that the IRFA does not adequately describe the regulated small entities and potential impacts on those entities. Second, Advocacy believes the IRFA does not adequately discuss specific alternatives that might reduce the impacts on small entities.  13 Id. 14 Id. 15 Id. 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Business development companies are a category of closed end investment company that are not registered under the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a 2(a)(48) and 80a 53 64). See 87 FR 16617 n. 176. 20 87 FR 16617. The IRFA provides that SEC estimates were based on staff analysis of Form 10 K filings for calendar year 2020, Morningstar data, and data submitted by investment company registrants. 21 5 U.S.C. § 603. 4  A. The Proposed Rules Do Not Adequately Describe and Estimate Small Entities or Impacts to Those Entities The IRFA contained in the proposed rules does not adequately describe the small entities to which the amendments would apply. The IRFA estimates that the proposed rules would apply to 669 small entities.22 However, it does not provide additional information, such as the North American Industry Classification System classifications of the affected entities. Additionally, the IRFA does not break down the affected entities into smaller size groups (e.g., based on total assets). Advocacy recommends that the SEC revise its IRFA and provide such information to better identify and describe the distribution of all regulated small entities.  Furthermore, the IRFA does not adequately analyze the relative impact of costs to small entities. SEC expects that the costs associated with the proposed amendments to be similar for large and small entities.23 Small business representatives from the biotechnology industry have told Advocacy that the proposed rules may be particularly problematic to emerging growth companies. Emerging growth companies may have little or no revenue to afford the additional cost burden of the proposed rules and may not have access to the cybersecurity expertise necessary to comply with the new disclosure requirements. Advocacy recommends that the SEC revise its IRFA using the detailed information described above to analyze the relative impact of costs based on entity size. This would help the SEC to understand the cost burden faced by the smallest regulated entities. B. The Proposed Rules Do Not Adequately Consider Alternatives  The IRFA does not contain a description of significant alternatives which accomplish the stated SEC objectives and which minimize the significant economic impact of the proposal on small entities. The RFA requires that an IRFA provide significant, feasible alternatives that accomplish an agencys objectives. In this case, the IRFA lists broad categories of potential alternatives to the proposed rules but does not analyze any specific alternative that was considered by the SEC.24 Instead, the IRFA supplies the SECs reasoning in rejecting each of the categories of potential alternatives. Most notably, the IRFA states that the SECs objectives would not be served by establishing different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements for small entities.25 This statement appears to reject, among others, all alternatives that would exempt small entities from the requirements of the proposed rules because exemption would conflict with the purpose of the rulemaking. Complete or partial exemption for small entities is therefore never analyzed within the IRFA. Nevertheless, the IRFA later requests comment on whether small entities should be exempted from certain elements of the proposed rules, including Regulation S K Item 106 disclosure regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance; the board expertise  22 87 FR 16617. 23 Id. 24 87 FR 16618. 25 Id. 5  disclosure requirement in proposed Item 407(j); and the requirements to present the proposed disclosure in Inline XBRL.26 Advocacy recommends that the SEC revise its IRFA to include alternatives which accomplish its objectives for the rulemaking. Advocacy further encourages the SEC to provide a detailed analysis of each potential alternative and to discuss how that alternative may reduce the economic burden on small entities. III.  Conclusion Advocacy is concerned that the proposed rulemaking and IRFA lack essential information that is necessary to inform the SECs decision making and any comments from regulated small entities. Advocacy urges the SEC to further analyze the impact of the proposed rules on small entities and explore regulatory alternatives before proceeding to a final rule. This analysis should be published in a supplemental IRFA to provide small entities an opportunity to comment. We are available to assist the SEC in its outreach to small entities and in its consideration of the impact upon them.

As our comments address only certain aspects of the Proposal, we have arranged them by topic rather than by question number. Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K  The Proposal anticipates that the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirement would result in more informative and more timely disclosure than is currently the case2. Moreover, though acknowledging that disclosure of such incidents in a Form 10 K or Form 10 inancial Proposal 3 As such, the Proposal favors immediate reporting of information that is potentially less useful to investors over reporting of information, even if later in time, that is more useful. Based on our experience in advising clients that are considering disclosure of a cybersecurity incident, we are concerned that the proposed Form 8 K reporting obligation will lead to the reporting of information that will not be decision useful to investors. While the Proposal only requires reporting of a cybersecurity incident following a determination that such incident is material, we expect that registrants will be inclined to report as soon as possible without the benefit of a considered analysis of the impact of the incident on the registrant in light of all of the relevant facts and circumstances giving rise to the event, which may not be known for some time. Registrants will do this out of a concern that, if judged in hindsight, they will be criticized for not reporting an incident when they thought that it could be material, even if they have not yet determined that it is material. Moreover, such concern will be exacerbated by the proposed (and unusual) soon as reasonably practicable after disc 4 As a result, we believe that registrants will report information of a lesser quality that is not necessarily informative for investors (e.g., basic, 1 Cybersecurity, Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590 (proposed Mar. 9, 2022). 2 Id. at 16607. 3 Id. at 16613. 4 Id. at 16596. DRAFT Securities and Exchange Commission  May 6, 2022 2 immediately known facts), and this could lead to investor confusion and the mispri securities. The fact that registrants could update their disclosure in subsequent reports (either voluntarily or as a result of the Proposal to provide more considered and better information for investors will be co securities following the initial report. In contrast, as the Proposal acknowledges, using a Form 10 Q and Form 10 K to disclose cybersecurity incidents would permit registrants more time to collect the relevant facts, consider and analyze a given incident, and provide higher quality, more informative disclosure to investors of material incidents. Needless to say, as is now the case, the absence of a specific Form 8 K requirement does not prevent a registrant from voluntarily disclosing the occurrence of a material cybersecurity incident by way of Form 8 K, or other Regulation FD compliant method. y Risks Our comments on this aspect of the Proposal proceed from the premise that any new disclosure requirement should seek to deliver material information for investors and not be duplicative of other disclosure requirements. As such, we submit that the proposed new Regulation S K Item 106(c) is unnecessary because any material information captured by the proposed rule is either already adequately addressed by Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (in respect of the board  As the Commission noted in 2018, pursuant to Regulation S K, Item 407(h):  description of how the board administers its risk oversight function. To the extent cybersecurity risks are 5 We submit that the proposed Item 106(c)(1) duplicates this requirement, insofar as it relates to material information, and otherwise requires an excessive level of immaterial detail, such as how a board is informed about cybersecurity risks and the frequency of its discussions on this topic.  related ics to discuss in Item 106(b) would obviate the need for Item 106(c)(2), thereby removing overlap between proposed 106(c)(2) and Item 106(b). Disclosure Regarding the Board of Director Cybersecurity Expertise We agree with the Commission6 that cybersecurity is already among the top priorities of many boards of directors. However, we submit that it does not automatically follow, as the Commission asserts, that investors may therefore find disclosure of whether any board members have cybersecurity expertise to be important. Rather, as with other elements of public company operations and risk management, investors expect the board to exercise oversight of cybersecurity risk management by, among other things, ensuring that management possesses appropriate expertise in the field of cybersecurity, including a suitably management expert where appropriate. However, while the board will exercise oversight of that CISO or other designated management as part of its general oversight of cybersecurity risk management, it is management that 5 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, Release No. 33 10459, 83 Fed.

The technical background of any specific board member is not inherently relevant to his or her ability to oversee and manage risk, whether that risk is cybersecurity or some other similarly important part of the business. Moreover, companies balance many important factors when assembling a board of directors, including experience, expertise and diversity. As a result, although many companies have directors who are qualified to assess cybersecurity oversight (and indeed oversight of other important areas), in our experience directors usually do not have the specific technical background that the Proposal seems to envision, such as prior experience as an incident response manager or a certification in cybersecurity. Because many companies today may not have a director who would meet the Proposal would be comfortable being so named), t composition and refreshment issues at a time when multiple competing priorities are also at play. This would, in our view, be an unfortunate distraction. Definition of cybersecurity incident therein. We are concerned that this suggests that an occurrence that merely has had the potential to cause a harm, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information residing therein, is nonetheless reportable even if no such harm actually occurs. Though the examples of cybersecurity incidents provided in the Proposal7 suggest that there should be a compromise, degradation, interruption, loss of control, theft or other actual harmful systems, we nonetheless urge the Commission to revise the definition of cybersecurity incident to make clear that the registrant must experience an actual harmful impact before a cybersecurity incident is reportable. * * * We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the process, and would be pleased to discuss our comments or any questions that the Commission or its staff may have, which may be directed to John B.

As SEC correctly identifies, cybersecurity is growing business concern in every industry. Just as the use of information technology (IT) and the collection of data opens businesses up to new opportunities for growth, innovation, and increased efficiency, it also opens them up to new risks. Attackers—including sophisticated state actors, criminal organizations, and insider threats—are constantly developing and employing new techniques that exploit technical or physical security vulnerabilities and human psychology to infiltrate or block access to IT systems and access, steal, alter, or hold data for ransom. Businesses of all sizes and from every sector of the economy can fall victim to cyber attacks, which can cause significant damage in the form of financial loss, intellectual property theft, reputational damage, operational delays, and legal ramifications.  The COVID 19 pandemic exacerbated this problem by shifting even more of Americans everyday business, communications, and other activities online. In addition, millions of Americans either permanently or temporarily switched to working from home, where their devices and Internet connections may have been less secure than what they would use at their offices. 2 1 Proposed rule: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incidence Disclosure, Securities and Exchange Commission, March 9, 2022, https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 11038.pdf. 2 Patrick Coate, Remote Work Before, During, and After the Pandemic, National Council on Compensation Insurance, January 25, 2021, https://www.ncci.com/SecureDocuments/QEB/QEB_Q4_2020_RemoteWork.html. 2 As the need for greater attention to cybersecurity becomes increasingly clear, many investors may wish to consider a firms cybersecurity practices in order to manage their own financial risk. ITIF supports SECs efforts to ensure publicly traded companies disclose relevant information on their cybersecurity practices and material cybersecurity incidents, which would enable investors to make more informed decisions, in line with existing SEC disclosure requirements. This type of transparency will not only help investors make more informed decisions, but it should also incentivize companies to adopt cybersecurity best practices.  First, the mandatory, ongoing disclosures of companies cybersecurity governance, risk management, and strategy listed in proposed Items 106(b) and (c) successfully outline key information that cybersecurity minded investors are likely to consider. This includes general information about a companys cybersecurity risk assessment and risk management activities, prioritization of cybersecurity in a companys business strategy, and board and management oversight of cybersecurity.  SEC should avoid requiring companies to disclose more detailed information about their cybersecurity governance, risk management, and strategy in order to avoid potentially providing attackers with a roadmap. However, the amount of detail currently required by the proposed Items strikes an appropriate balance. SEC should also refrain from exempting smaller or emerging companies from these disclosure requirements. Cybersecurity risk affects companies regardless of size. Additionally, smaller or emerging companies are at high risk of going out of business following a data breach or cyber attack. 3 This is a significant risk that investors need to be made aware of.  Second, the mandatory cybersecurity incident disclosure (proposed Item 1.05) is also crucial for investors, given the financial, operational, and reputational impacts cybersecurity incidents may have on targeted businesses. There is an argument for requiring incident disclosure after the incidents impact is quantified or can be reasonably estimated, as SEC acknowledges in its request for comment. However, timely reporting is important for investors to make informed decisions, and determining or even estimating the full extent of an incidents impact can often be a lengthy process. There is room for companies to disclose additional information regarding the extent of an incidents impact, along with other details, once that information becomes available, but the initial disclosure should prioritize timeliness.  There are, however, two details regarding the current cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements in proposed Item 1.05 the SEC should change. First, the current incident disclosure requirements should  3 Scott Steinberg, Cyberattacks now cost companies $200,000 on average, putting many out of business, CNBC, October 13, 2019, https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/cyberattacks cost small companies 200k putting many out of business.html. 3 provide a narrow exception if federal or state law enforcement agencies determine that disclosure would impede an ongoing criminal investigation into the incident. This would benefit investors in cases when a successful law enforcement investigation leads to the recovery of stolen funds or intellectual property. It would also balance the interests of investors against other societal interests, such as prosecuting criminal activity.  Second, SEC should cooperate with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to harmonize proposed cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements with CISAs Incident Reporting System. Companies must already comply with existing data breach notification laws at a state and federal level, and there is an opportunity for SEC to work with CISA to minimize the amount of duplicative work companies must do at least on a federal level.  Overall, SECs proposed rule strikes a good balance of providing investors with important information regarding cybersecurity risk without providing too much detail that attackers could potentially exploit. The proposed rule would create greater transparency and accountability into cybersecurity risk management and incident response, areas that are of growing concern to many investors given their potential financial, operational, and reputational impact.

Countryman Secretary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street NE Washington DC 20549 1090  Re: Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (File No. S7 09 22) Dear Ms. Countryman:  We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (the Commission or SEC) request for comments on the proposed rule on Cybersecurity Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (the Proposed Rule). This comment focuses on the potential adverse consequences of requiring disclosure of cybersecurity incidents that are not publicly known and not remediated. Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (ESRT or we) is a self managed REIT that operates a portfolio of office, retail, and multifamily properties, including the world famous Empire State Building office and observation deck, in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area. ESRT has been registered with the SEC as a publicly traded company since 2013 and its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Like other companies in our business lines, we rely extensively on technology, both internal and outsourced, to process transactions and manage our business, so our business is increasingly at risk from cyberattacks that continue to increase in number, intensity and sophistication. A cyberattack can compromise the confidential information of employees, tenants, customers and vendors, and disrupt business operations and relationships. Any compromise of security can also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, with damage to legal and financial condition, reputation and records. Further, information systems may be considered to be susceptible to a future terrorist attack.  On March 9, 2022, the Commission issued the Proposed Rule to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding, inter alia, cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies, including by requiring current reporting on cybersecurity incidents within four business days of a registrant determining that the incident was material. Critically, there is no carveout or flexibility for reporting non public incidents that have not been remediated or that involve law enforcement. We appreciate the Commissions desire to address the concern that material cybersecurity incidents are underreported and that existing reporting may not be sufficiently timely. However, by requiring disclosure of non public cybersecurity incidents with active, unremediated vulnerabilities, the Proposed Rule carries a risk of unintended, adverse consequences for the investing public. As explained further below, disclosing unremediated vulnerabilities can result in cyberattacks within hours of disclosure, which in turn can cause significant financial damage to a  2 company and its shareholders. ESRT therefore requests that the Commission consider and address the issues discussed below in order to mitigate this risk. Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents On Form 8 K The proposed timing for reporting material cybersecurity incidents does not distinguish between active versus remediated incidents, or between non public and publicly known incidents, and would therefore require public disclosure of non public and unremediated vulnerabilities. Although we acknowledge the importance of promptly disclosing cybersecurity incidents, there are certain scenarios—such as when an incident is not publicly known and has not been remediated—where public disclosure may risk exposing registrants to additional cyberattacks or thwart law enforcement. And, depending on the nature of the incident and the affected registrant, this risk may trickle down or up to other registrants and companies, including vendors such as cloud service providers, and even the federal government. Avoiding forced pre mature disclosure under such circumstances allows a company to provide more accurate and complete information to investors, and thus aids, rather than undermines, the SECs goal of protecting investors by providing information that is material to their investing decisions. Current Reporting Timeline The Proposed Rule would require a registrant to report a cybersecurity incident within four business days of determining that it is material. The definition and examples of what would constitute a material incident appear to sweep in virtually all cybersecurity incidents, including, inter alia, data/system/network breaches and/or vulnerabilities, ransomware attacks, and even threats or offers to publicly disclose sensitive company data.1 As such, it appears that the SEC expects that a materiality determination will be made on or near the date of discovery—e.g., when one of the enumerated examples of material incidents occurs. The proposal previews this by explicitly stating that [i]n some cases, the date of the registrants materiality determination may coincide with the date of discovery of an incident.2 As a practical matter, the Proposed Rule would thus frequently require disclosure of material incidents within four business days of the date of discovery. This timeline is too short. In many situations, four days may not be sufficient to fully understand the extent of the incident to determine materiality, much less enough time to contain or remediate the underlying vulnerability. Indeed, the four day disclosure timeline would require that registrants disclose incidents approximately three months earlier than the average time recent studies have shown it takes companies to contain cyber incidents and more than 6 months before they typically can remediate vulnerabilities.3  1 Id. pp. 24  25.  2 Proposed Rule, p. 22.  3 A study sponsored and published by IBM Security found that the average time to contain a data breach in 2020 was 73 days, but was high as 93 days for the public sector and healthcare industries. See IBM Security, Cost of a Data Breach Report (2020), pp. 52, 54 available for download at https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RZAX14GX. Another study found that an average time of 202 days was needed to fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities as of the first half of 2021. See David Bisson, High Severity Vulnerabilities Now Take Nearly 250 Days to Remediate, Survey Finds, SECURITY INTELLIGENCE, September 29, 2021, https://securityintelligence.com/news/news vulnerabilities 25 days remediate/   3 Potential Harms to Investors In addition to requiring public disclosure of non public unremediated cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities, the Proposed Rule would also require a registrant to disclose whether it has remediated or is currently remediating the incident. There are at least two risks associated with this requirement. First, it potentially exposes the reporting registrant to additional cyberattacks by informing threat actors that the companys information system is vulnerable. Studies have shown that threat actors are actively and continuously scanning for vulnerable systems. As one security researcher put it, adversaries are opportunistic predators, constantly searching for vulnerable targets to attack.4 Furthermore, industry experts have warned that even generic disclosures, without technical details about the underlying vulnerability, can expose a company to cyberattacks.5 In fact, the mere knowledge of a vulnerabilitys existence in a feature of some product is sufficient for a skillful person to discover it for themselves. Rumor of a vulnerability draws attention from knowledgeable people with vulnerability finding skills—and there is no guarantee that all those people will have users best interest in mind.6  Second, premature disclosure may interfere with active investigations by law enforcement, and the Proposed Rule does not contain any mechanism to delay reporting incidents in such circumstances. This issue is particularly salient for companies that operate critical infrastructure and/or in the national security arena. Responsible Disclosure The Proposed Rule would require a registrant to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on information systems owned or used by the registrant. Past examples have shown that public disclosure of unremediated vulnerabilities can result in cyberattacks within hours of disclosure against an unlimited range of targets.7 Hence, requiring a registrant to disclose in a matter of days an incident on a third party service providers system could potentially result in attacks against the vendor and their enterprise customers (many of whom may themselves be registrants) well before they are able to implement mitigation. Additionally, disclosing a vulnerability in one vendors system can expose vulnerabilities in the same components used by other vendors. This risk is particularly relevant where the vulnerable component is widely used. For example, a vulnerability known as Meltdown, which was discovered in 2018, reportedly affect[ed] almost all computers,  4 Rob Rachwald, Cortex Xpanse Researchers Identify Missing Metric for Modern SOC, Palo Alto Networks, May 19, 2021, https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2021/05/rsac attack surface management/  5 Allen D.

Therefore, when a researcher discovers a vulnerability, she or he confidentially reports it to the vendor who is responsible for developing a fix and they agree to an embargo period—during which time the vulnerability is kept a secret to allow vendors to release security updates or mitigations and workarounds to protect customers. Importantly, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has provided guidance making clear that [t]here is no single universally appropriate timeframe for investigating and remedying security vulnerabilities.13 And, as Richard Prethia, director of SEI/CMU, CERT Division,14 explained in his testimony before the US Senate, the best way to . . . improve the security of [] systems is to work with . . . technology producers and vendors to develop workarounds and repairs for security vulnerabilities disclosed to the CERT/CC. To this end, in the absence of a major threat, we do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a repair or workaround has been developed, along  8 Aaron Mak, A Major Chip Flaw Affects Nearly Every Computer.

See https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/; see also https://irp.fas.org/congress/1996_hr/s960605m.htm.  5 with directions on how to install it.15 In short, the Proposed Rule would conflict with responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities, which would ultimately harm the investing public by increasing the cybersecurity risks for the reporting registrants, other public companies, and their service providers. Recommendations  In order to address and mitigate the above concerns, the SEC should consider revising the Proposed Rule to permit flexibility in the reporting timeline where a reportable incident (i) is not publicly known; and (ii) is not contained, has unremediated vulnerabilities, is subject to a pending law enforcement investigation and/or pursuit of the threat actor(s), or occurs on an information system used (but not owned) by the registrant.  *** We appreciate this opportunity to provide comments on the Proposed Rule for the Commissions consideration, and welcome further discussion if helpful.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) echoes this principle, noting that the timeframes for disclosing vulnerabilities is dependent on a number of factors, including, among other things, the availability of effective mitigations and vendor estimate of time required for customers to obtain, test and apply the patch.  CISA also explains that CISA may work with vendor(s) to facilitate time for affected end users to obtain, test, and apply mitigation strategies prior to public disclosure. https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.",2

Issue summary and summary of the R Street position  The R Street Institute (R Street) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy research organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. Our mission is to engage in policy research and outreach to promote free markets and limited, effective government. The R Street Institutes Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team focuses on the national security implications of individual, business and government cyber risk. For this reason, the latest Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) proposed rulemaking is of particular interest to the team. The proposed rulemaking, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure (hereafter the rulemaking) is issued in accordance with the S.E.C.s mandate to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the securities markets. It is designed to ensure 1) that public companies disclose material cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner; and 2) that public companies disclose the broader details of how and whether they undertake cybersecurity risk assessment, continuity and response programs, and management.  The R Street Institutes Cybersecurity team broadly supports mandatory cybersecurity incident and risk management reporting, and notes that bipartisan lawmakers have called for such a rulemaking.1 The team believes cybersecurity risk is business risk, and that this risk is directly connected to national security—specifically the need to protect U.S. markets from the ever evolving influx of cybersecurity threats while ensuring economic growth in spite of inevitable cyberattacks.   1 Jack Reed et al., Cybersecurity Disclosure Letter, United States Senate, Feb. 8, 2022. https://www.reed.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cybersecurity disclosure letter to sec chair gensler.pdf.  That said, the team has significant concerns around the current format of the rulemaking, including several items that must be modified, delayed or removed to ensure that the regulations enhance rather than harm overall security; are interoperable with other state and federal government rulemakings on incident reporting; are reasonable obligations for businesses; and provide useful public information for investors. II. Overview of the proposed rulemaking  The stated goal of the S.E.C.s reporting requirements is to enable investors to make accurate decisions about the value of a company. Cybersecurity risk is a major component of modern business risk, and thus is integral to understanding whether a company is a safe investment. The reporting requirements may also help incentivize and equip business and industry to appropriately valuate and prioritize cybersecurity risk management. That is, businesses may be able to take advantage of increased information to better understand how their peers and clients weigh the importance of cybersecurity risk management, and to respond accordingly.  The rulemaking has two major components:  First, to require public companies to promptly disclose to investors if they experience a material cybersecurity incident. Specifically, companies would be required to report on such an incident no later than four business days after the finding of materiality (Section II:B); to update the public regularly on new information about previously reported incidents (Section II:C:1); and to disclose to the public any series of cybersecurity incidents that become material in the aggregate (Section II:C:2).  Second, to require public companies to disclose some of the details regarding how they manage and view their own cybersecurity risk. Specifically, companies would be required to disclose how cybersecurity risk is managed and expected to impact overall business operations (Section II:D:1); what, if any, cybersecurity risk assessment, management and continuity of operations/response programs are in place (Section II:D:1); how cybersecurity risk is managed and prioritized by the Board (Section II:D:2); and the level, if any, of cybersecurity expertise of the Board (Section II:E). There are also sections governing how this information should be conveyed to the S.E.C. and how foreign private issuers will be impacted.  As the S.E.C. notes at length, this rulemaking is not the first cybersecurity reporting guidance issued to public companies. It does, however, represent the first formalized rulemaking in this area, as previous issuances have been in the nature of guidance. These rules are necessary, according to the S.E.C., because companies are insufficiently reporting of their own volition or under current guidance; some do not seem to report at all. Others report inadequately or too slowly, and still others may report to different entities or authorities other than the S.E.C.  III. Fundamental considerations  To begin, there are three fundamental considerations that have been raised by other parties in response to the rulemaking. The first is whether the rulemaking conflicts with existing incident reporting passed by Congress, especially the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA),   which passed in March 2022.2 The second is whether it imposes an undue burden on business. The third is whether the information required of companies under the S.E.C. rulemaking provides actionable information for investors.  A. Does the rulemaking oppose congressional intent?  The first thing to ascertain is if the S.E.C. s rulemaking contradicts the will of Congress by imposing requirements that do not dovetail with Congress CIRCIA. For example, some argue that Congress favors confidentiality and liability protection for security reasons, and that this should be the main aim of the federal governments rulemaking in this arena. As a reminder, the CIRCIA imposes reporting requirements on critical infrastructure owners and operators within 72 hours to the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).3 It also requires covered entities to report ransomware payments to CISA within 24 hours. When arguing that the S.E.C. rulemaking undercuts the intent of Congress, critics are generally pointing out that CIRCIA, along with the 2015 CISA Act, provide liability protection and anonymity for companies that report.4 By contrast, the S.E.C. requires public disclosures for the benefit of investors. Another concern is that the S.E.C. is issuing these requirements before the CIRCIA regulations have even been drafted, perhaps conflicting with future potential regulations. While the R Street team agrees in part with these concerns, it must be noted that these are different authorities with different goals. CIRCIA is focused on systemic security risk to critical infrastructure. The S.E.C. is focused on ensuring investors have access to full information—for which public disclosure is obviously necessary. Second, there is a deconfliction requirement written into CIRCIA, requiring it to take other measures like those of the S.E.C. into consideration when drafting the new regulations at some point in the next several years. On the other hand, the S.E.C.s rulemaking does not align with a trend of private incident reporting focused on improving national security—the most recent example of which is CIRCIA. It also enters a crowded—and contradictory—environment of risk, breach and reporting requirements for U.S. business. This ecosystem includes data breach requirements in existing federal law like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA); state privacy and incident reporting laws; agency and sector specific guidelines and regulation; and 2 Mariam Baksh, Key Lawmaker Defends SECs Cyber Incident Reporting Proposal, NextGov, March 30, 2022. https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2022/03/key lawmaker defends secs cyber incident reporting proposal/363829.  3 Mary Brooks, Cyber Incident Reporting: What It Is, Why We Need It, What It Will Fix—and How Congress is Approaching the Issue, Part Two, R Street Institute, Feb. 17, 2022. https://www.rstreet.org/2022/02/17/cyber incident reporting what it is why we need it what it will fix and how congress is approaching the issue part two.  4 Ashlie Beringer et. al, President Biden Signs into Law the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, Expanding Cyber Reporting Obligations for a Wide Range of Public and Private Entities, Gibson Dunn, March 22, 2022. https://www.gibsondunn.com/president biden signs into law the cyber incident reporting for critical infrastructure act expanding cyber reporting obligations for a wide range of public and private entities; Guidance to Assist Non Federal Entities to Share Cyber Threat Indicators and Defensive Measures with Federal Entities under the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, October 2020. https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Non Federal%20Entity%20Sharing%20Guidance%20under%20the%20Cybersecurity%20Information%20Sharing%20Act %20of%202015 1.pdf.  others.5 There are also new proposed incident reporting requirements being discussed and promulgated by other agencies. B. Does the rulemaking impose an undue burden on business?  The second concern is that the rulemaking could impose a heavy regulatory burden on public companies, while private companies are unaffected. There are, after all, only a few thousand public companies in the United States, while there are millions of privately held companies that would not have such reporting requirements. 6 However, this is simply not the mandate of the S.E.C. Public companies choose to go public in order to gain access to additional capital from investors. As such, they have an obligation to disclose publicly to their investors. In fact, they are already required to do so, in some circumstances. While the S.E.C. should do its best to minimize the regulatory burden on companies (more on this below), a lack of reporting requirements in one sector does not justify a lack in others. Of course, this is not to say that private companies are not impacted by cybersecurity incidents and in turn impact the overall security of the United States or the public. In those cases, it will be up to Congress or other entities with authority to pass similar requirements for private companies if they determine there is a security reason to do so. The fact that the S.E.C. is an early mover in this space likely stems from its robust history and mandate to issue regulations—a framework that makes it easier to consider and incorporate cybersecurity requirements, rather than starting from scratch some other industries must.  In short, the United States needs to move from a culture of secretive cyber incident response to a culture of more open and honest communication. Cybersecurity is a collective action problem—and one major way to handle this is by informing the public and raising awareness of cyber incidents to emphasize that this risk impacts everyone. This should be done in a way that is not designed to penalize or publicly shame companies, but rather to incentivize transparency and strengthen cyber practices. The question is whether forced public reporting will contribute to that culture, or alternatively contribute to compliance burden without actually improving transparency, openness and accountability. C. Does the rulemaking help investors make decisions?  Bipartisan members of Congress have called for measures like that of the S.E.C., writing that investors have a right to prompt notification of serious cybersecurity incidents. More information will enable investors to hold companies and investment managers accountable.7 Critics are concerned, however, that while more information can be helpful, it is not clear if investors would actually take a different 5 See, e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

This is a problem the S.E.C. itself touches upon:  We are unable to quantify the potential benefit to investors and other market participants as a result of the increase in disclosure and improvement in pricing under the proposed amendments. The estimation requires information about the fundamental value of securities and the extent of the mispricing. We do not have access to such information, and therefore cannot provide a reasonable estimate. (Section III:C:1:a(i))  The S.E.C. does not have this information because, as they state, this type of reporting at scale has not been attempted before—as, perhaps, is often the case with new rulemakings. What is already known is that investors do claim a high level of concern over cybersecurity risk, at least in general.8 Polls have found that cybersecurity is some investors foremost environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk.9 Perhaps most pertinent, research by Ernst & Young has found that:  Because the threat of a breach cannot be eliminated, some investors stressed that they are particularly interested in resiliency, including how (and how quickly) companies are detecting and mitigating cybersecurity incidents. Some are asking their portfolio companies about specific cybersecurity practices, such as whether the company has had an independent assessment of its cybersecurity program, and some are increasingly focusing on data privacy and whether companies are adequately identifying and addressing related consumer concerns and expanding regulatory requirements.10  It would be helpful to know whether the S.E.C. has conducted any research into investors priorities and decision making processes in this area, and what those preliminary results were. At this point, we urge a cautious and slow approach to the rollout of this rulemaking, given that the expected costs to business are higher than the currently known benefits for investors. In summary, each of these points above has merit, but the team believes the need to provide greater transparency for investors and the public is also important. We are confident that the spirit of the S.E.C.s rulemaking can be modified to address these concerns and blunt the worst of them. We do suggest, however, that the S.E.C. delay finalization of the proposed rule for some months to better understand the implications on business and on security, and that, when implemented, there is a delayed uptake process or grace period to allow businesses to prepare themselves for the new requirements.   8 See, e.g., Cyber Disclosures Reveal Varying Levels of Transparency Across High Risk Sectors, Moodys Investors Service, Oct. 2, 2019. https://journalofcyberpolicy.com/wp content/uploads/2019/10/Moodys Cyber disclosures 10.19.pdf; Beatrice Peterson, Wall Street Eyes Cybersecurity, with Goldman Sachs Announcing $125 Million Investment, abcNews, April 20, 2022. https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wall street eyes cybersecurity goldman sachs announcing 125/story?id=84091514.  9 RBC Corporate Governance and Responsible Investment Team, Cyber Security is the Top ESG Concern for Institutional Investors, RBC Global Asset Management, Feb. 12, 2020. https://www.rbcgam.com/en/ca/article/cyber security is the top esg concern for institutional investors/detail.  10 Steve W.

IV. Point by point considerations  While we support the overall spirit of the rulemaking as drafted, there are a few considerations that must be addressed before the rulemaking is finalized. *Note that the headings and numbering below directly reference the S.E.C. rulemaking. B. Reporting of Cybersecurity Incidents on Form 8 K  3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents?   Potentially, yes. See points 4, 6, 7 and 10, below.  4. Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05?  Yes. While investors could possibly benefit from the reporting of material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8K, their needs should be balanced with other priorities, namely accuracy, security and privacy, as well as creating the least burdensome environment for companies. A four business day deadline from the finding of materiality is simply too short for multiple reasons:  + Accuracy:  + It may cause undue harm or panic, as many of the questions identified in 1.05 will likely not be figured out within four business days. That could decrease the overall integrity of the incident reporting process. + Perversely, it could incentivize companies to intentionally delay finding something to be material despite the as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery language (p. 22). + Security:  + It may expose technical details unwittingly, as teams do not yet know what is important and what is not. It may also force a company to notify investors of a breach before systems are patched or otherwise configured securely—something that could also implicate other companies in a supply chain breach. + It may interfere with law enforcement and related investigations into a given incident, whether at a local level or with the FBI or CISA. + Privacy:  + If individuals personal information is compromised in an incident, a company could potentially have to prioritize warning investors before warning victims. This is the wrong order as affected users often need to take immediate action over their breached information. + Burdensome:  + It places too heavy of a burden on reporting an incident while teams are still endeavoring to identify the full extent of harm, ensure continuity of operations and remove the threat. It is important to balance transparency with truth finding, security and privacy. The best way to do this is to extend the deadline for public disclosure. A deadline of 15 business days is more reasonable but   still ensures timely disclosure—after all, current reporting times range from many weeks to even months.11 The S.E.C. could also implement a cure period to allow businesses a defined period of time to fix potential reporting mistakes, which could be perpetual or for the initial stages of the reporting requirement. This would allow businesses an opportunity to comply rather than facing enforcement over what might be a simple mistake.  5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident?  No. Material impact is a good metric that will differ from company to company. Imposing, as suggested in Question 5, a quantifiable threshold determined by affected asset percentage or cost is unproductive. For example, one company might face higher monetary losses from a cyber incident, but a second companys breach that has a lower rate of loss but a business model that relies on data integrity—such as an online verification platform—is critical for an investor to know about. That said, the S.E.C. s definition of what is material is not clear and should be better defined in the rulemaking— particularly to prevent companies taking advantage of delaying a material determination in order to avoid reporting or for companies inadvertently not complying because of a misunderstanding or lack of clarity.  6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? Yes—but the extent is not clear. Not all conflicts are problematic, and some are yet to be determined (for example, the above mentioned need for CISA to build out CIRCIA requirements). Some, however, may pose a privacy or security concern. Take, for example, the following hypothetical: a major public company that stores private health information is breached. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the breach must be disclosed to victims within 60 days.12 Thus, there is the potential for investors to know about a breach of confidential health information before victims are aware. There is furthermore the potential for criminals to take advantage of the knowledge that there has been a breach but that victims have not yet been informed. The same could be said for state privacy laws, which mandate reporting of incidents across very different timelines. Of course, these other delays are not the responsibility of the S.E.C and this should not be an excuse to avoid public reporting. However, the S.E.C. should much more aggressively deconflict with other reporting requirements before passing this rulemaking, given the situation. Again, extending the four business day reporting period will also help here.  7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security?    11 Jake Olcott and Maham Haroon, From Months to Minutes: Can New Regulations Accelerate the Cyber Incident Disclosure Process?, BitSight, March 29, 2022. https://www.bitsight.com/blog/months minutes can new regulations accelerate cyber incident disclosure process.  12 Office for Civil Rights, Breach Notification Rule, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, July 26, 2013. https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for professionals/breach notification/index.html.  Yes. While the excuse of an investigation has for too long been used to obfuscate the details of cybersecurity incidents, there are major reasons why exceptional security circumstances should justify a delay. + Investigators may not want to tip off criminal or state actors to the fact that their operations into U.S. systems have been discovered—a revelation that could cause these actors to hide or otherwise bide their time and make remediating the attack more difficult.  + Information could harm diplomatic or strategic efforts being led by the U.S. government. + Reporting may interfere with classified internal government discussion and decisions on attribution if the breach was perpetrated by a nation state adversary. + Reporting may cause evidence related to a criminal investigation to be compromised or lost.  In short, the Attorney General must be allowed to ask for a reporting delay. In fact, it may be better to allow a similar determination to also be made by CISA, the FBI, the office of the National Cyber Director, the National Security Council and/or the Intelligence Community. Nevertheless, such a determination should be extraordinary rather than routine. 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? In some cases, yes. It appears that it will depend on 1) how well the third party compromise is understood (or even if the third party discloses a breach or compromise at all); and 2) how well the given public company understands its own assets and liabilities. It seems likely that companies have direct control over the second dependency, and that they will require new acquisitions and contract language to ensure the first dependency is met. One point to consider more fully is whether this could potentially worsen a broader supply chain compromise. If a public company is required to disclose an incident involving a third party provider within four days, that may preempt the third party providers own reporting obligations, ability to issue a patch, or ability to ensure that the patch or other mitigative measures have been implemented.  Thus, compromises of third party providers should perhaps be handled separately from the proposed new process to avoid worsening a supply chain incident. If possible, a security screening might be added prior to the publication of third party related compromises. This could help mitigate security risks.  11. We are proposing that registrants be required to file rather than permitted to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Should we instead permit registrants to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such that the Form 8 K would not be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act unless the registrant specifically states that the information is to be considered filed or incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or Exchange Act?  No. This wording is not particularly clear, but it is our position that this should be a mandatory rather than a voluntary exercise. We reiterate our concerns about the short timeline, several vague definitions and no exceptions for law enforcement or national security considerations.   C.  Disclosure about Cybersecurity Incidents in Periodic Reports  15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K in the registrants quarterly or annual report, as proposed? Yes. Ongoing reporting is perhaps even more important than the initial disclosure, as it signals to investors which companies have security procedures in place to ensure continuity of operations, protect from further intrusion and return to business as usual.  16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to provide disclosure in Form 8 K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate?  Yes—on Form 8K. In the same way that materiality is determined for an individual incident and required to be reported on Form 8K, so too should aggregate incidents be reported. However, first the S.E.C. should more clearly define what constitutes materially aggregate instances and provide strong examples thereof. Notably, cybersecurity incidents are so unfortunately common that a strict reading of this section could cause overreporting to the point that it is meaningless for shareholders. The worst thing to do is to overload the system with information that is not analytically meaningful.   D. Disclosure of a Registrants Risk Management, Strategy and Governance Regarding Cybersecurity Risks   17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Generally, yes. Investors can and should know the ongoing steps that a company is taking to manage cybersecurity risk. Businesses may also benefit from a transparent accounting of how other companies are prioritizing cybersecurity. However, this needs to be balanced so that details that could compromise an entitys security posture are not required. For example, precise information on how entities protect themselves, what products they use or how they plan to respond to a cyber incident could be exploited by a bad actor. Businesses may even be targeted if an actor determined they have weak cybersecurity measures in place.  For this reason, the S.E.C. needs to be specific about the level of detail expected in reports and ensure overly sensitive data is not provided for public disclosure. As one example, there is a difference between answering whether the registrant undertakes activities to prevent, detect, and minimize effects of cybersecurity incidents with a simple Yes/No and needing to provide specific measures about how incidents are detected.  19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. … Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful?   Yes. This is a rulemaking on cybersecurity. A common definition seems necessary. The S.E.C. should use the definition provided by CISA: Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.13 22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? Generally, no. Obviously, companies should not give detailed descriptions of software or step by step response policies, but this disclosure inquiry is an iteration of the tired argument that security by obscurity is helpful. This idea is outdated. Keeping secret about a lack of preparedness does nothing but enable bad habits and patterns to continue. However, a one year grace period might be offered to companies before reporting requirements come into effect in order to ease the transition.  E. Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise   26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way? Unclear. It is not clear to us how this information benefits investors or how cybersecurity expertise on the Board is more beneficial than other measures—such as ensuring that cybersecurity risk is thoroughly communicated to the Board; that it is incorporated into strategy; and that decision makers at the highest levels are held accountable for cybersecurity failures.  V. Request for clarification In addition to the points above, there is a further question that the team does not believe has been clearly addressed in the rulemaking: Can information in these filings be used as evidence to hold a company liable in related or unrelated criminal or civil cases? The S.E.C. should affirmatively say that this information should not be used for enforcement actions unless a company willfully does not comply with these disclosure agreements. The goal of this rulemaking is to increase transparency and public knowledge about the management of business risk— not to penalize businesses.  VI. Conclusion In conclusion, the R Street Cybersecurity team supports the S.E.Cs efforts to improve public information around cybersecurity incidents and the risk management decision making processes of public companies. Nonetheless, there are several components that should be revisited in order to ensure that 13 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Security Tip (ST04 001), Department of Homeland Security, Nov. 14, 2019. https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04 001.  the regulations enhance rather than harm overall security; are interoperable with other state and federal government rulemakings on incident reporting; are reasonable obligations for businesses; and provide useful public information for investors.

Washington, D.C. 20549  RE: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Proposed Rule (File No. S7 09 22)  Dear Chair Gensler:  The Confidentiality Coalition appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed rule on, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. The Confidentiality Coalition is composed of a broad group of hospitals, medical teaching colleges, health plans, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, vendors of electronic health records, biotech firms, employers, health product distributors, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, health information and research organizations, and others, committed to advancing effective patient privacy and security protections. Our mission is to advocate policies and practices that safeguard the privacy and security of patients and healthcare consumers while, at the same time, enabling the essential flow of patient information that is critical to the timely and effective delivery of healthcare, improvements in quality and safety, and the development of new lifesaving and life enhancing medical interventions.  Cybersecurity incidents are a significant challenge to companies. From 2020 to 2021, publicly traded companies reported a 118% increase in unauthorized access incidents and a 44% increase in ransomware attacks.1 These attacks can be harmful to companies in terms of financial cost2 and the unauthorized release of sensitive information. Healthcare companies are particularly at risk of cybersecurity incidents. In 2021, over 45 million individuals were impacted  1 Chris Gaetano, Cybersecurity incidents soar at public companies, Accounting Today (April 6, 2022), https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/cybersecurity incidents soar at public companies says audit analytics report.  2 Heather Landi, Average cost of healthcare data breach rises to $7.1M, according to IBM report, Fierce Healthcare (July 29, 2020), https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/average cost healthcare data breach rises to 7 1m according to ibm report. 2  by cyberattacks on healthcare entities, a record amount,3 and of the 16 sectors categorized as critical infrastructure, healthcare companies reported the most ransomware attacks.4  While the Confidentiality Coalition supports steps to increase awareness around cybersecurity incidents, we are concerned that the proposed disclosure framework would be overly burdensome to publicly traded companies without advancing the Security and Exchange Commissions (SEC) goal of transparency regarding cybersecurity incidents. Indeed, disclosing the impact of cyberattacks is appropriate to ensure public trust, but requiring all potential breaches to be reported within 96 hours of discovery would, among other things, increase the likelihood of misreporting, market volatility, civil liability, and risk to reputation.  The healthcare industry already has extensive health data breach reporting requirements as part of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Acts (HIPAA) Privacy and Security rules as well as the Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) Breach Reporting Rule. Further, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is expected to begin rulemaking on reporting of cyber breaches affecting critical infrastructure, which includes healthcare. We encourage the SEC to recognize the adequacy of these existing requirements and work with the healthcare industry to avoid duplicative reporting and instead focus on collaboration, education and support, rather than punitive action.  Notably, HIPAAs reporting requirements contain a clear definition of breach and a four factor analysis to determine when an incident must be reported to the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). These requirements balance the need for timely notice while recognizing a thorough and accurate investigation takes time. Here, the proposed rule does not provide a comparable timeframe to complete an investigation before requiring public notification. Consequently, information disclosed in a report released to the SEC within 96 hours of discovery is more likely to be inaccurate or incomplete, which could lead to misreporting by the media and result in confusion among individuals, investors, customers, industry partners, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies.  Further, HIPAA allows for a reporting delay if a law enforcement official indicates that a notification, notice, or posting required under HIPAA would impede a criminal investigation or result in harm to national security. Here, the proposed rule fails to provide any reporting delay when there is an ongoing investigation of a cybersecurity incident. Failing to recognize a delay for notification by law enforcement will undermine HIPAA, and increase risk to the registrant, the overall healthcare industry, impacted individuals, state and/or federal investigations, and national security. As proposed, the rule will increase the likelihood of misreporting by the media, as a 96 hour disclosure requirement will require entities to publish incomplete or possibly inaccurate information. This will in turn increase market volatility, impede a full investigation, and increase the risk of civil liability. In addition to federal requirements, currently 21 states have a state cybersecurity breach law, the majority of which require reporting within three business days of discovery; however, this is limited to the information available at the time of reporting. We recognize the need to provide greater transparency around cybersecurity incidents but are concerned that the proposal to disclose these events on Form 8 K would be unduly burdensome  3 Heather Landi, Healthcare data breaches hit all time high in 2021, impacting 45M people, Fierce Healthcare (February 1, 2022), https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health tech/healthcare data breaches hit all time high 2021 impacting 45m people.  4 Internet Crime Report 2021, Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center (March 23, 2022), https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf. 3  and provide little useful information for the SEC when examining these events. The Confidentiality Coalition encourages the SEC to recognize that cyber breaches require companies to quickly respond to a significant event and to work with impacted entities in ensuring that reporting is focused on assistance and education rather than punitive action. Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA) is preparing regulatory action to mandate cyber breach reporting. We encourage the SEC to work with CISA to ensure that the proposed rule is not unnecessarily duplicative. The Confidentiality Coalition looks forward to working with the SEC on further steps to improve cybersecurity readiness.

The CBA is a professional industry association that provides information, advocacy education and operational support services to its membership of more than 60 domestic and foreign banks operating in Canada. The CBA provides governments and others with a centralized contact for matters relating to banking in Canada, and advocates for public policies that contribute to a sound, thriving banking system to ensure Canadians can succeed in their financial goals. A number of the CBAs members are also foreign private issuers (FPIs) listed on national securities exchanges in the United States and subject to U.S. periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The SECs multijurisdictional disclosure system (MJDS) for Canadian issuers allows eligible Canadian issuers to register securities under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and to register securities and satisfy their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act by use of documents prepared largely in accordance with Canadian requirements. We note that in the release proposing the Proposed Rules (the Proposing Release), the SEC specifically addresses Canadian MJDS registrants and requests comments on whether the SEC should amend Form 40 F to require such registrants to comply with the Proposed Rules in the same manner as Form 10 K (for U.S. domestic registrants) or Form 20 F (for non MJDS FPIs) filers. In response to this request for comment, we believe, consistent with the SECs existing and longstanding approach to disclosure requirements applicable to MJDS registrants, that such registrants should be excluded from any incremental cybersecurity disclosure requirements in connection with their annual reports on Form 40 F.  2 We note that the Proposed Rules would require all in scope issuers (including non MJDS FPIs) to disclose: (i) their policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks (including whether they consider cybersecurity risks as part of their business strategy, financial planning and capital allocation); (ii) the board of directors and managements role in cyber governance; and (iii) cyber expertise of any member of the board of directors in their periodic reports on Forms 10 K and 10 Q (for U.S. domestic issuers) and Form 20 F (for non MJDS FPIs). We believe that applicable Canadian annual and interim disclosure requirements are sufficient to ensure investors receive material information regarding material cybersecurity incidents, and cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. See the discussion under Background on the Canadian Regulatory Framework below. As a result, there is no reason for the SEC to depart from the longstanding MJDS principle of deference to Canadian disclosure requirements, and MJDS registrants should be exempt from the Proposed Rules in all circumstances. Background on the Canadian Regulatory Framework We note that the policy considerations underlying the Proposed Rules are frequently addressed under home country corporate, stock exchange or other requirements. This is certainly the case with respect to MJDS registrants. For example, the Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA) identified cybersecurity as a priority area in the CSAs 2016 19 Business Plan and have maintained their focus in this area. The CSA has accordingly published a series of notices outlining disclosures that should be made in respect of material cybersecurity incidents, and risks and related mitigation strategies (collectively, the Staff Notices).1 The Staff Notices set out, among other things, the CSAs expectations that each registrant will: (i) adopt cybersecurity policies and procedures which govern the use of electronic communications and devices, network security and the verification of client instructions sent electronically; (ii) require frequent training of all employees, including with respect to risk recognition, types of cyber threats and incident escalation; (iii) conduct an annual risk assessment process; (iv) prepare an incident response plan; (v) oversee the cybersecurity practices of service providers that have access to firm networks or data; (vi) implement data protection safeguards, including the use of encryption and passwords on all computers and electronic devices; and (vii) maintain insurance that adequately covers cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, as part of ongoing efforts by the CSA to highlight cybersecurity risks for issuers, registrants and other regulated entities, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (Quebec) published a multilateral staff notice with respect to disclosure of cyber security risks and incidents (the Multilateral Staff Notice).2 The Multilateral Staff Notice recognizes that any disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect the  1  CSA Staff Notice 11 326, Cyber Security (September 26, 2013); CSA Staff Notice 11 332, Cyber Security (September 27, 2016); CSA Staff Notice 33 321, Cyber Security and Social Media (October 19, 2017). 2  Multilateral Staff Notice 51 347, Disclosure of Cyber Security Risks and Incidents (January 19, 2017).  3 business, results of operation and financial condition of issuers, and provides guidance on risk factor disclosure to a variety of issuers across different industries.  Similar to the Proposed Rules, the Staff Notices and Multilateral Staff Notice focus on governance and incident disclosure in connection with cybersecurity. • Cyber Incident Disclosure: A cybersecurity incident must be disclosed in accordance with securities legislation if it is a material fact or material change to the issuers business.3 When determining the materiality of a cybersecurity incident, the CSA notes that there is no bright line test and the threshold at which a cybersecurity incident becomes material will vary between issuers and industries. The materiality determination (which is necessarily a dynamic process that runs through the detection, assessment and remediation phases) requires a contextual analysis of the cybersecurity incident. For instance, an isolated cybersecurity incident may not be material but a series of minor incidents may become material, depending on the type and magnitude of disruption caused.  • Cyber Governance (and Risk Mitigation): On an ongoing basis, the CSA discusses cybersecurity policies and procedures with registered firms as part of compliance reviews. Areas of focus include: (i) cyber security risk assessment and information security governance programs; (ii) IT safeguards and controls; (iii) use of encryption; (iv) risks related to third party service providers; (v) vulnerability tests and compliance monitoring; (vi) evidence of regular employee training and awareness; (vii) incident response plans; and (viii) practices for accepting client instructions to withdraw or transfer funds via electronic means.4 The CSA states that its cybersecurity Staff Notices apply to all registered issuers regardless of their size, how recently they were registered or the extent to which they rely on service providers or affiliates for their cybersecurity safeguards.  Furthermore, the members of the CBA, in their capacity as financial institutions (particularly, members that are Federally Regulated Financial Institutions (FRFIs)  all CBA members that file periodic disclosure reports with the SEC are FRFIs), are subject to an additional layer of regulatory requirements and guidelines in relation to cybersecurity (incident) disclosure and governance imposed by financial and industry regulators in Canada, including the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC)5,  3  The issuer should refer to the guidance in National Policy 51 201 Disclosure Standards and may in addition refer to the provisions of Part 1(f) of Form 51 102F1 Managements Discussion & Analysis and Part 1(e) of Form 51 102F2 Annual Information Form of National Instrument 51 102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations (see Multilateral Staff Notice, page 607 (40 OSCB)). 4 CSA Staff Notice 11 332, Cyber Security (September 27, 2016). 5 Section 3703 (Reporting by a Dealer Member to IIROC), IIROC Incident Reporting (available at https://www.iiroc.ca/rules and enforcement/iiroc rules/3000/3703 reporting dealer member iiroc); IIROC Fundamentals of Technology Risk Management dated March 31, 2021; IIROC Notice on Cybersecurity  Ransomware dated March 16, 2021; IIROC Notice on Cybersecurity and Fraud  Protecting Clients dated November 9, 2020; IIROC Notice on Cloud Services and 4 the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA)6 and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). OSFI is the primary prudential regulator for FRFIs, and recently issued a release with respect to Technology and Cyber Security Incident Reporting detailing reporting criteria, initial notification requirements and subsequent reporting requirements.7 This release provides, among other things, that FRFIs must report a technology or cyber security incident to OSFIs Technology Risk Division as well as their lead Supervisor at OSFI within 24 hours (or sooner if possible). OFSI is also in the process of finalizing its Draft Guideline B 13 on Technology and Cyber Risk Management, which sets out OSFIs expectations for sound technology and cyber risk management across five domains (i.e., Governance and Risk Management, Technology Operations, Cyber Security, Third Party Provider Technology and Cyber Risk, and Technology Resilience).8  The foregoing demonstrates that the Canadian securities and financial industry regulators view cybersecurity as an important priority, and as a result, have released or are in the process of releasing multiple cybersecurity (incident) disclosure and governance requirements and guidelines. Exemption for MJDS Registrants We note that while the SEC is not proposing any changes to Form 40 F, which governs the annual reports filed by MJDS registrants with the SEC, it is seeking comment on whether it should require MJDS registrants to comply with cybersecurity related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10 K and 20 F filers (potentially, through an amendment to Form 40 F). Cybersecurity periodic reporting requirements are proposed to be added as a new Item 106 of Regulation S K and Item 16J of Form 20 F, and through an amendment to Item 407 of Regulation S K. We request that, in the event the SEC adopts the new Item 106 of Regulation S K and Item 16J of Form 20 F and amends Item 407 of Regulation S K, the SEC expressly acknowledge that MJDS registrants will be exempt from the new disclosure requirements, consistent with the statement in the Proposing Release to such effect.  Application Interfaces dated June 24, 2020; IIROC Notice on COVID 19 and Cybersecurity  Tips for Advisors and Employees dated April 21, 2020; IIROC Notice on COVID 19 and Cybersecurity dated March 30, 2020; IIROC Cyber Governance Guide dated March 3, 2020 (IIROC notices are available at https://www.iiroc.ca/members/cybersecurity technology). 6 MFDA Policy No.6 on Information Reporting Requirements dated March 17, 2016 (available at https://mfda.ca/policy/policy06/); MFDA Bulletin on Cybercriminals Currently Exploiting the COVID 19 Pandemic dated March 19, 2020, #0816 M (available at https://mfda.ca/bulletin/bulletin0816 m/); MFDA Bulletin on Cybersecurity dated May 19, 2016, #0690 C (available at https://mfda.ca/bulletin/bulletin0690 c/). 7  OFSI Technology and Cyber Security Incident Reporting, effective as of August 13, 2021 (available at https://www.osfi bsif.gc.ca/Eng/fi if/rg ro/gdn ort/adv prv/Pages/TCSIR.aspx). 8  The proposed Guideline B 13 is designed to complement existing Guidelines E 21 (Operational Risk Management) and B 10 (Outsourcing of Business Activities, Functions and Processes), as well as its Technology and Cyber Incident Reporting Policy and its Cyber Security Self Assessment tool (see OFSI Draft Guideline B 13 on Technology and Cyber Risk Management (available at https://www.osfi bsif.gc.ca/Eng/fi if/rg ro/gdn ort/gl ld/Pages/b13.aspx)).  5 We believe imposing additional cybersecurity disclosure requirements on MJDS registrants would result in significant inefficiencies, inconsistencies and incremental costs as well as unnecessary duplication of administrative effort by MJDS FPIs subject to multiple different cybersecurity disclosure regimes. As described above, Canadian issuers are already subject to home country requirements and guidelines with respect to cybersecurity disclosure. Deference to home country practice in respect of such disclosure and governance matters has historically been viewed by MJDS FPIs as minimizing the risk of such inconsistent and/or overlapping requirements and guidelines.  Extension of the Proposed Rules to issuers already subject to substantially similar requirements would be viewed as a step in the wrong direction for the efficiency of global capital markets and be contrary to the principles of MJDS. Other Concerns with the Scope of the Proposed Rules In the event that the final rule requires MJDS registrants to comply with cybersecurity related disclosure requirements in the same manner as Form 10 K and 20 F filers, which the CBA strongly opposes, we have four significant concerns with the Proposed Rules as drafted. First, we believe that not all of the proposed required disclosures are necessarily material (or even helpful) to inform investors, as some disclosures are likely to be vague, overbroad or even potentially misleading at the time required to be made under the Proposed Rules due to the difficulty of capturing the complexities of a cyber threat or attack in a very short period of time, and as a result may accomplish more harm than good (including potentially exposing registrants to unwarranted litigation risks). This is particularly true when registrants are required to disclose ongoing and unremediated cybersecurity incidents which may involve even greater risks and harms to such registrants, their customers and businesses and, by extension, their shareholders and other market participants. The SEC argues in the Proposing Release that these risks and harms are outweighed by the benefit of publicly disclosing a cybersecurity incident while it is still ongoing and unremediated.9 However, required disclosures of ongoing and unremediated incidents poses far greater security risks in the current more advanced cyber threat environment than we believe has been anticipated by the SEC. In the experience of our members, the perpetrators of cyberattacks frequently seek to hide their presence in the network, making it difficult or impossible to identify such bad actors at the time a cybersecurity incident becomes known, and so providing such bad actors with notice will grant them an opportunity to further hide their identity and activities. In addition, immediate disclosure of ongoing and unremediated incidents will enable other bad actors to further target a registrant at a time when it is already focused on addressing a known threat. This is particularly concerning for complex financial institutions with operations in many international jurisdictions. If banks are compelled to publicly disclose ongoing or unremediated material cybersecurity incidents, or otherwise publicly disclose information about registrants cybersecurity environment or potential system vulnerabilities so as to alert perpetrators of attacks or empower additional threat actors to gain unauthorized access to compromised systems, this could have devastating impacts on broader economic stability. In addition, we are concerned that collecting relevant information from  9  Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed. Reg. 16590 (Mar. 23, 2022) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 229, 232, 239, 240, and 249), at 16596.  6 third party service providers regarding ongoing and unremediated incidents relating to those providers will be difficult or impossible and increase the likelihood that an initial mandated disclosure is not complete or accurate. As such, we do not believe the security risks posed by disclosure of ongoing and unremediated cybersecurity incidents are outweighed by the benefit of immediate public disclosure. Second, as complex financial institutions that routinely use third party IT service providers for their IT infrastructure, our members also have concerns that the Proposed Rules may potentially require such service providers to publicly disclose an ongoing and unremediated cyberattack. Such premature disclosure would inhibit the service providers ability to respond and could enable bad actors to use the service provider as a vector to attack its customers before the service provider or its customers have had a chance to take remedial measures to mitigate harm. We believe that public disclosure by a critical vendor of an ongoing and unremediated incident increases the likelihood that the vendor can be leveraged by malicious cyber actors as a vector to infiltrate customers, including financial institutions and other critical infrastructure providers.  Third, the proposed Item 407(j) of Regulation S K would require registrants to disclose whether any member of the board of directors has cybersecurity expertise (and, if so, the directors name and details sufficient to fully describe the nature of the expertise). We believe expertizing certain members of a companys board of directors also raises concerns. We believe that this disclosure requirement would exert pressure on registrants to appoint directors with such expertise, which may come at a significant cost to the ability of their boards to oversee other risks to the company without proportionate benefits, particularly at boards of heavily regulated financial institutions. Further, by appointing directors with single subject matter expertise, registrants may experience less effective board oversight, as those with expertise may naturally assume responsibility over cybersecurity risk and management, which the board as a whole should oversee. The proposed responsibility allocated to the board could blur the lines between the typical or existing responsibility allocation between the board and management. Further, we wanted to note that the Proposed Rules do not include a safe harbor, which is the case in other areas that require specific expertise.  Fourth, the Proposed Rules would not permit a reporting delay for ongoing investigations, even where federal law enforcement has requested a delay and state law permits it.  While the SECs request for comment asks whether there should be a safe harbor allowing registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests a delay from the SEC,10 the scope of the contemplated exemption is indefensibly narrow, particularly for registrants with operations outside of the United States. In our view, there should be an exemption to permit delayed disclosure upon the request of any competent national, state or local law enforcement authority. Requiring disclosure notwithstanding the request of a reporting delay by law enforcement would  10 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, 87 Fed.

Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security?  7 otherwise likely result in: (i) great difficulty or impossibility for law enforcement to collect significant evidence or apprehend the bad actors; and (ii) the destruction of evidence or information that could identify the bad actors or further actual or intended victims or could assist in assessing the scope and impact of the incident (including the remedial measures). * * *  Conclusion Thank you for the opportunity to provide our view on the Proposed Rules. For the reasons discussed above, we respectfully believe that MJDS registrants should be exempt from any incremental cybersecurity requirements under the Proposed Rules.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I write to you as an independent cybersecurity expert and the recently retired Chief Information Security Officer of IntercontinentalExchange (NYSE:ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange and owner/operator of multiple public equity markets and additional critical economic infrastructure entities inside and outside of the United States. During my 25+ year career I enjoyed the unique opportunity to liaise with international regulatory agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, with whom I was able to engage separately as an officer of a publicly traded US parent company and as the Chief Information Security Officer of two SEC regulated critical infrastructure entities. Across my experience Ive been able to take part in the broader regulatory lifecycle from rulemaking to enforcement across not only public equity markets focused on disclosure and shareholder reporting, but also core infrastructure focused primarily on mitigating cybersecurity impact. This experience sat at a unique juncture to observe what regulatory actions benefited not only public shareholders, but also citizens dependent on a sound, reliable, and performant critical infrastructure. While the cyber regulatory frameworks over public companies and critical infrastructure are distinct, there have been significant lessons learned in critical infrastructure that should inform public company regulatory decision making. First, it is worth noting that critical infrastructure regulation shares a focus on incident disclosure alongside public company oversight. This captured the public eye during the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident of May 2021 and subsequent Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act ratified in March of 2022. While the Act closed gaps in reporting for critical infrastructure in sectors lacking strong cybersecurity oversight, reporting requirements in many other sectors including financial services and energy have been enforced for many years. Those of us with history under cyber forward regulators watched CISAs foray into critical infrastructure reporting with interest, as it took a fresh look at requirements similar to those weve operated under for many years. While existing requirements governing critical infrastructure and other regulated sectors require notification of primary regulators, the new Act focuses on providing notification to DHS CISA. In proposal S7 09 22, the Commission goes a step further via notification to public shareholders. All of these efforts and their international counterparts wrestle with the same questions; What defines an incident? What defines materiality? And finally, when is it reasonable to expect notification after these criteria are met? The Commission has done well to focus on material cybersecurity incidents. Other authorities have flirted with the notion of incidents that merely present the potential of jeopardy, panicking industries recognizing a potentially limitless expanse of reportable events. Materiality has been core to the Commissions remit since the Securities Act of 1933, and it is wise to extend this notion  which preserves signal to noise ratio for the investing public  to cybersecurity. When it comes to detailed requirements around reporting  namely timing, escalation, and the concept of aggregating low severity alerts, I will supply direct feedback in line with the Commissions request for comment. First, however, it is essential to provide situational awareness about the cybersecurity incident response lifecycle. Only a small subset of cybersecurity incidents begin with an observation of impact  such as a ransomware or denial of service attack taking systems offline. The majority of incidents come to light through an investigative process. Examples in this area include data theft, financial fraud, and resource hijacking. It is particularly notable that these sorts of incidents are the ones more likely underpinning the Commissions impression of underreporting, since more dramatic service interrupting incidents are instantly observable from the outside. Within this sphere of investigation driven incidents, the majority begin with an unremarkable alert among many. The business of triaging alerts and sifting through the noise to determine which should get human attention is a core focus of cybersecurity innovation. These manual and automated processes peel the onion layer by layer, usually concluding that the observed activity is authorized, poorly documented, inaccurately categorized by nascent detection technology, or otherwise dismissed as a false positive. Where investigations begin to confirm unauthorized activity or policy violations, however, they escalate in severity, bringing additional investigative resources to bear and expanding internal notification to a wider audience potentially including legal, compliance, and company management. Determining that damage occurred often happens only after this investigative process, at which point materiality can begin to be assessed. A mature incident response process will use escalation procedures to bring business leaders and legal or compliance professionals into the discussion at the appropriate phase, as they are the ones who can assess materiality. It is important to have this model in mind and understand that incidents begin as tiny seeds, most of which die along the path of investigation. The majority of incidents that are ultimately deemed reportable will thus have had to matriculate through a process that adds information along the way until materiality can be properly assessed. Separately, with regard to introductory material the Commission should be cautious in interpreting media reporting of an otherwise undisclosed incident as a lapse that should or would be corrected via the proposed rulemaking. There are numerous reasons for public reporting about a breach that do not correlate with materiality thresholds, ranging from the pure salaciousness of a rumor to false claims made by an adversary in pursuit of extortion. Directly or indirectly equating media reporting of an incident with materiality would put a new weapon in the hands of extortionists, since simply drumming up hype and a media story around a purported breach could trigger new public disclosure requirements and potentially move a stock price. In addition to confusing the investing public, this sequence of events would empower adversaries. Firms should be expected to apply well documented criteria to incident classification and judgment of materiality with disclosure requirements tied to those conclusions, rather than the virality of a news story. 1. Would investors benefit from current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8 K? Does the proposed Form 8 K disclosure requirement appropriately balance the informational needs of investors and the reporting burdens on registrants? The proposal as written strikes a good balance. There will be times where an investigation is moderately jeopardized by reporting requirements, but thanks to materiality thresholds they will be limited to only the most dramatic and unavoidable edge cases. 2. Would proposed Item 1.05 require an appropriate level of disclosure about a material cybersecurity incident? Would the proposed disclosures allow investors to understand the nature of the incident and its potential impact on the registrant, and make an informed investment decision? Should we modify or eliminate any of the specified disclosure items in proposed Item 1.05? Is there any additional information about a material cybersecurity incident that Item 1.05 should require? The level of disclosure is appropriate. With respect to specifically asking if data or operations were impacted, it is worth noting that some incidents will have materiality due to one of those elements but not the other. For example, a ransomware attack may be reportable due to operational impact, but an assessment of data theft may conclude that portion is de minimis and immaterial. Likewise, a data theft incident may have a minor side effect of accidentally disabling individual immaterial systems in the process, and while the data loss may trigger materiality the operational impact would not. As written a registrant could specify that no material data impact or no material operational impact was observed in the two cases, respectively, but this ability should be considered and preserved if the language evolves. 3. Could any of the proposed Item 1.05 disclosures or the proposed timing of the disclosures have the unintentional effect of putting registrants at additional risk of future cybersecurity incidents? If so, how could we modify the proposal to avoid this effect? For example, should registrants instead provide some of the disclosures in proposed Item 1.05 in the registrants next periodic report? If so, which disclosures? The proposed timing of the disclosures is better bundled into question 4 on the four business day requirement, but the treatment of the incident timeline among information to be disclosed warrants feedback. As written, requiring disclosure of when the incident was discovered is unlikely to consistently add to investor benefit while disproportionately carrying the potential to create confusion and generate questions that can not or should not be answered at the time of the 8 K filing. For example, given the incident lifecycle previously noted, it is possible the true discovery time of an incident via a raw alert was long ago, and only the discovery of additional details or activity later escalated into a candidate for materiality determination. In that case forcing disclosure of a distant date before the investigation was complete could drive speculation and second guessing that self perpetuates market impact. It would serve investors well for the Commission to require disclosure of when the incident was declared material, providing discretion for registrants to include timeline detail where it is supportive and beneficial. It is right to permit this but not require this, as in some cases specific timelines would jeopardize investigations. The fact that reporting timelines are triggered by the assessment of materiality ensures that this timeline reporting leeway is not a concern for potential abuse. Other information expected via the proposal is appropriate as written, but warrants support in case it is challenged during the rulemaking process. Specifically, the flexibility provided in brief description of the nature and scope of the incident allows the timing proposed to avoid exacerbating risk. Were the Commission to require details around vulnerabilities exploited or details results of investigative activity, this could quickly change and provide an adversary with useful detail to tailor their strategies. 4. We are proposing to require registrants to file an Item 1.05 Form 8 K within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Would the proposed four business day filing deadline provide sufficient time for registrants to prepare the disclosures that would be required under proposed Item 1.05? Should we modify the timeframe in which a registrant must file a Form 8 K under proposed Item 1.05? If so, what timeframe would be more appropriate for making these disclosures? The four day notification period works due to the strict materiality test and because disclosed information is qualified via to the extent the information is known at the time of the Form 8 K filing. It is important those qualifications are not abandoned. 5. Should there be a different triggering event for the Item 1.05 disclosure, such as the registrants discovery that it has experienced a cybersecurity incident, even if the registrant has not yet been able to determine the materiality of the incident? If so, which information should be disclosed in Form 8 K based on a revised triggering event? Should we instead require disclosure only if the expected costs arising from a cybersecurity incident exceed a certain quantifiable threshold, e.g., a percentage of the companys assets, equity, revenues or net income or alternatively a precise number? If so, what would be an appropriate threshold? Mature incident response programs (including those driven to maturity via this Proposal) will design severity levels and escalation procedures so that the legal and compliance teams that ensure fulfillment of these obligations are brought into the incident response process when a potential trigger of these conditions is at hand. Any notions of triggering notification around technical timelines absent a materiality assessment are unsustainable, as they drive dangerous practices around trying to inject compliance personnel into the entire incident response process or expecting cybersecurity analysts to become regulatory enforcement experts. In practice the volume and sensitivity (imagine false positive alerts around routine suspicious employee behavior that are determined inaccurate) of low level cyber alerts warrants limiting access to incident responders, and the criteria that incident responders adjudicate should be supportive but not directly reflective of codified regulation. Put another way, incident responders should know to flag the disclosure of data as a trigger for general escalation, at which point data protection officers, compliance personnel, and other legal professionals can assess the vast and constantly evolving array of data privacy and other relevant rules such as those proposed. Any temptation to trigger reporting by incident discovery or  worse  the discovery of potential  destroys that balance and creates situations where the lines between incident responders and lawyers are dangerously blurred. 6. To what extent, if any, would the proposed Form 8 K incident reporting obligation create conflicts for a registrant with respect to other obligations of the registrant under federal or state law? How would any such conflicting obligations arise, and what mechanisms could the Commission use to ensure that registrants can comply with other laws and regulations while providing these timely disclosures to investors? What costs would registrants face in determining the extent of a potential conflict? There will continue to exist regulatory frameworks across the globe that impose reporting requirements absent a materiality clause. In those cases it is possible that a registrant has to make a cyber related disclosure through an independently regulated foreign or US subsidiary despite not meeting the more prudent threshold of the Commission. Enforcement teams will be well served to recognize this distinction and not view disclosures in other jurisdictions as breaches of duty under the proposed rule by default. 7. Should any rule provide that the Commission shall allow registrants to delay reporting of a cybersecurity incident where the Attorney General requests such a delay from the Commission based on the Attorney Generals written determination that the delay is in the interest of national security? This should be examined to determine if prevailing law already implies the same, which one would hope. If, however, that is not the case or too much is open to interpretation, this should be clearly spelled out. 8. We are proposing to include an instruction that a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery of the incident. Is this instruction sufficient to mitigate the risk of a registrant delaying a materiality determination? Should we consider further guidance regarding the timing of a materiality determination? Should we, for example, suggest examples of timeframes that would (or would not), in most circumstances, be considered prompt? In light of the cybersecurity incident response lifecycle, materiality can not be assessed until an incident has escalated to a sufficient level to involve appropriate senior resources. While one might argue compliance with this statute by declaring it impracticable to assess materiality until an incident has matriculated through the escalation process sufficiently, it could drive counterproductive behavior if interpreted poorly as written since a relatively insignificant alert can start the clock on discovery. The issue is resolved via simplifying to a registrant shall make a materiality determination regarding a cybersecurity incident as soon as reasonably practicable to do so. 9. Should certain registrants that would be within the scope of the proposed requirements, but that are subject to other cybersecurity related regulations, or that would be included in the scope of the Commissions recently proposed cybersecurity rules for advisers and funds, if adopted, be excluded from the proposed requirements? For example, should the proposed Form 8 K reporting requirements or the other disclosure requirements described in this release, as applicable, exclude business development companies (BDCs), or the publicly traded parent of an adviser? On balance the answer here is no. Different regulations and rules have different stakeholders and missions to satisfy, and trying to view some as superseding others can have unintended consequences. For example, incident reporting proposals for Investment Advisors would only trigger materiality for a publicly traded parent a subset of the time, and in those cases the additional audience and standard filing types and locations under this proposal will be appropriate to receive treatment. 10. As described further below, we are proposing to define cybersecurity incident to include an unauthorized occurrence on or through a registrants information systems, which is proposed to include information resources owned or used by the registrant. Would registrants be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by them? Would a safe harbor for information about cybersecurity incidents affecting information resources that are used but not owned by a registrant be appropriate? If so, why, and what would be the appropriate scope of a safe harbor? What alternative disclosure requirements would provide investors with information about cybersecurity incidents and risks that affect registrants via information systems owned by third parties? In some cases registrants will be reasonably able to obtain information to make a materiality determination about third party incidents. This will most commonly be because they observe an impact. In those cases the proposal as written would clearly apply. In cases where a third party incident cannot be perceived or yet perceived as material, it is not reasonable to expect disclosure and the proposal as written would not require it. There is no need for change, as a third party incident naturally begets a first party incident when it becomes relevant. 11. We are proposing that registrants be required to file rather than permitted to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K. Should we instead permit registrants to furnish an Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such that the Form 8 K would not be subject to liability under Section 18 of the Exchange Act unless the registrant specifically states that the information is to be considered filed or incorporates it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or Exchange Act? 12. We note above a non exclusive list of examples that would merit disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8 K covers some, but not all, types of material cybersecurity incidents. Are there additional examples we should address? Should we include a non exclusive list of examples in Item 1.05 of Form 8 K? The list of examples needs improvement, which is of particular relevance since registrants will be hungry for them. The first 3 examples are unfortunately vague and undifferentiated. For example the first instance simply notes an unauthorized incident that has compromised the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset… The next goes on to list an .incident that has caused damage… This is clearly a subset of the previous example. The third example has an unauthorized party accessing, altering, or stealing data, which is captured in the confidentiality compromise in the first vague example. Further, the Commision wisely prefaces the examples with if determined by the registrant to be material, but this needs more emphasis since the most popular reason driving referral to this section will be in pursuit of judging materiality itself. Likewise, negative examples would be equally valuable as positive in determining reportability. Specifically, registrants would be well served to hear treatment of common examples such as: ● The unauthorized transmission of confidential data by an employee before resigning. While in this case the unauthorized breach of confidentiality would constitute review, the small volume of information, relatively low sensitivity (eg business contacts versus material trade secrets), and/or ability of the firm to challenge the offender and gain an affidavit of deletion may disqualify it from being deemed material. ● The detection of a ransomware infection on a single or limited number of computers that was successfully contained before it could become widespread. In this case while the incident response efforts may have been significant, the lack of material operational impact and reasonable assurance of containment could drive the conclusion that reporting is not required. ● A ransomware infection disabling the ability of a remote office to conduct normal operations for a two week period. In this case the breadth of infection or time alone would not trigger reporting requirements, but the operational impact of the incident would if it were deemed likely to ultimately result in a material financial impact. ● A denial of service attack rendering a primary corporate web site unavailable for two hours during a business day. While a calculation of the direct revenue lost through the incident may be unlikely to compute a material dollar value, if a reasonable investor might find the resulting information about targeting of the company, customer behavior in response to the attack, and the registrants ability to respond to the attack persuasive in investment decision making then it could be deemed material for reporting requirements. ● The discovery of a critical vulnerability in an Internet facing information system that could have been exploited to cause catastrophic damage. While the processes and operations that discovered this risk and oversaw remediation should be described per other requirements of this proposal, a risk does not constitute an incident unless it manifested as such, and there is no incident disclosure requirement. ● The discovery that a recent acquisition had suffered an undetected compromise years prior with undetermined extent. 13. Should we include Item 1.05 in the Exchange Act Rules 13a 11 and 15d 11 safe harbors from public and private claims under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b 5 for failure to timely file a Form 8 K, as proposed? 14. Should we include Item 1.05, as proposed, in the list of Form 8 K items where failure to timely file a Form 8 K will not result in the loss of a registrants eligibility to file a registration statement on Form S 3 and Form SF 3? 15. Should we require registrants to disclose any material changes or updates to information that would be disclosed pursuant to proposed Item 1.05 of Form 8 K in the registrants quarterly or annual report, as proposed? Are there instances, other than to correct inaccurate or materially misleading prior disclosures, when a registrant should be required to update its report on Form 8 K or file another Form 8 K instead of providing disclosure of material changes, additions, or updates in a subsequent Form 10 Q or Form 10 K? This proposal is useful to provide updates, but a few small adjustments can avoid misinterpretation. First, the word potential should be avoided in the following example: Any potential material future impacts on the registrants operations and financial condition;. This example would be more specific if changed to Any likely material future impacts… Second, Any changes in the registrants policies and procedures is unnecessary and overly broad. As Ill articulate in separate feedback, the notion of policy and procedural documents is a bit misportrayed, and in fact firms are likely to deploy specific technical controls, repair shortcomings in control deployment, and/or deploy more control testing to improve prevention or detection in light of an incident. It would be dangerous to disclose those specific changes, leaving a high level summary here redundant to the actions that would be described in response to the previous bullet on remediation. 16. Should we require a registrant to provide disclosure on Form 10 Q or Form 10 K when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate, as proposed? Alternatively, should we require a registrant to provide disclosure in Form 8 K, rather than in a periodic report, as proposed, when a series of previously undisclosed and individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents becomes material in the aggregate? The concept of aggregating lower severity incidents to reach a reporting threshold does not resonate with the cybersecurity community, where the misguided conflation of volumetric events with urgency often drives confusion. While we frequently tout metrics around the raw number of attempted compromises or malicious network packets, in the age of automation and high speed computing frequency and recurrence does not correlate with the likelihood of success or impact. A properly instrumented Cybersecurity Incident Response Procedure will elevate or create a new parent incident of sufficient severity to trigger notification and reporting thresholds when impact begins, and there is not value in separately litigating the math around whether the sum of low severity incidents infers a condition warranting reporting. Put into example, a high severity Denial of Service attack doesnt manifest as a large number of discrete low impact incidents; rather it is a single major incident. In the event previous detections kicked off while the attack was ramping up and were deemed inconsequential, they are likely to be aggregated into a single incident long before materiality is judged. Similarly, individual phishing incidents that compromise users may open and close as medium severity incidents, but if there is such a rash of them that it demonstrates a concerted campaign, that campaign will constitute a high severity incident in itself with materiality assessed when there is impact. The only potential validation of the aggregation concept may be fraud, if hundreds or thousands of low value fraudulent transactions add up to a material economic value. In that case, however, there would be a parent incident tied to the root issue and thematic condition, which would then be assessed for materiality. The idea of rooting out individual smaller incidents for some sort of aggregation test doesnt hold a practical application that would warrant implementation as rule. 17. Should we adopt Item 106(b) and (c) as proposed? Are there other aspects of a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures or governance that should be required to be disclosed under Item 106, to the extent that a registrant has any policies and procedures or governance? Conversely, should we exclude any of the proposed Item 106 disclosure requirements? The Commission should take care in deploying the term policies and procedures for the purposes of the proposal. While the term has seen frequent use before and since the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, in recent times it is associated with specific detailed documents when applied within operational risk management and cybersecurity teams. Subsequent language in the proposal around disclosing risk management and cybersecurity strategy or programs more broadly is more reflective of the aim here, and should be favored throughout. Traditional regulatory goals citing policies and procedures were often associated with defending against internal abuse, ethical violations, abuse of privilege, and similar threats of opaqueness such as insider trading. Establishing firm policies to manifest Commission rules was a large step, followed by implementation, compliance, and audit procedures to ensure employees obeyed the rules. Adversarial Risk Management  and specifically cybersecurity  introduces a threat element outside the firms control, and assurance programs are thus much broader than policy and procedure. In practice what a diligent third party (be it an Investor, Regulator, or even Board member) should aspire to observe is deliberate identification of cybersecurity threats and a resulting cybersecurity program, most often codified in a strategy document. That strategy should set the course for cyber risk management activity including active testing against identified threats, the continuous identification of specific risks that would allow a threat to manifest, and the well instrumented remediation of those risks with consistent repetition. Such activities are not codified via policies at most firms, where policies relate more to specific behavior requirements and prohibitions placed on employees. Likewise, procedures are highly technical in nature, containing screen shots and URLs of internal tools and specific mouse clicks expected of staff. Cybersecurity procedures are more akin to field manuals than high level program descriptions. The Commission should specify program or strategy more commonly, as much will get lost in translation by the time resulting code promulgates through the long tail of registrant companies, and the wrong choice of words could drive companies to not only over share sensitive technical documents and irrelevant employee policies, but also to reactively draft and ratify generic policy documents en masse that do not reflect a company level strategic imperative. With that semantic change favoring strategy or program for most occurrences of policies and procedures in Section D, the content sheds the jeopardy of misinterpretation and becomes effective. 18. Are the proposed definitions of the terms cybersecurity incident, cybersecurity threat, and information systems, in Item 106(a) appropriate or should they be revised? Are there other terms used in the proposed amendments that we should define? This statement can be substantially reduced to Cybersecurity incident means unauthorized occurrence or policy violation involving information systems that jeopardizes confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The removals in the proposed version serve several important purposes. First, removing registrants avoids an accidental exclusion of third party systems. Second, including policy violation captures a large number of common security incidents ranging from employee misuse of data to violation of third party contractual provisions, all of which would fortunately be further subjected to materiality provisions for the purposes of the proposal. Finally, removing of… information systems avoids the risk of inadvertently excluding cyber attacks with a physical threat objective such as those upon operational technology. 19. The proposed rule does not define cybersecurity. We could define the term to mean, for example: any action, step, or measure to detect, prevent, deter, mitigate, or address any cybersecurity threat or any potential cybersecurity threat. Would defining cybersecurity in proposed Item 106(a) be helpful? Why or why not? If defining this term would be helpful, is the definition provided above appropriate, or is there another definition that would better define cybersecurity? If cybersecurity were to be defined, it should not be done in a circular manner by employing subordinate terms such as cybersecurity threat. That said, while we struggled for years with the term cyber as practitioners, it has converged over time into common parlance. Attempts to define it here would not be helpful. 20. Should we require the registrant to specify whether any cybersecurity assessor, consultant, auditor, or other service that it relies on is through an internal function or through an external third party service provider? Would such a disclosure be useful for investors? It could be valuable to specify that using third parties does not exempt registrants from any requirements herein, but requiring disclosure of which functions are performed in house versus externally has the potential to cast an air of inferiority on outsourced services and disadvantage the many registrants who do not have the resources to build and maintain cybersecurity teams directly. Core functions that should be expected for internal performance amount to governance, and those functions are treated separately in the proposal. 21. As proposed, a registrant that has not established any cybersecurity policies or procedures would not have to explicitly state that this is the case. If applicable, should a registrant have to explicitly state that it has not established any cybersecurity policies and procedures? Again, switching terminology to cybersecurity programs or strategies offers help. 22. Are there concerns that certain disclosures required under Item 106 would have the potential effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or have other potentially adverse effects by highlighting a registrants lack of policies and procedures related to cybersecurity? If so, how should we address these concerns while balancing investor need for a sufficient description of a registrants policies and procedures for purposes of their investment decisions? A firm should indeed have to explicitly state if it has not established a cybersecurity program or strategy (not policies or procedures) with supporting rationale. The jeopardy of this disclosure inviting attack is self policing, since a firm that would be susceptible to attack must have some level of cybersecurity program in place. Further, changing terminology lowers the bar for being able to affirm this statement while driving beneficial behavior. It would be a reasonable use of resources for smaller firms to draft a strategy, while forcing them to implement policies is likely to drive them into downloading reams of boilerplate policy that is not reflective of culture and practices. 23. Should we exempt certain categories of registrants from proposed Item 106, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs? If so, which ones and why? How would any exemption impact investor assessments and comparisons of the cybersecurity risks of registrants? Alternatively, should we provide for scaled disclosure requirements by any of these categories of registrants, and if so, how? With proper terminology the proposal can adapt to different sizes and categories of registrants naturally. 24. Should we provide for delayed compliance or other transition provisions for proposed Item 106 for certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, FPIs, or asset backed securities issuers? Proposed Item 106(b), which would require companies to provide disclosures regarding existing policies and procedures for the identification and management of cybersecurity incidents, would be required in annual reports. Should the proposed Item 106(b) disclosures also be required in registration statements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act? No. 25. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 106 overlap with disclosure required under Item 407(h) of Regulation S K (Board leadership structure and role in oversight)with respect to board oversight of cybersecurity risks? To the extent there is significant overlap, should we expressly provide for the use of hyperlinks or cross references in Item 106? Are there other approaches that would effectively decrease duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? There is indeed substantial potential for overlapping or redundancy. That said, the solution does not have to be limited to incorporation by reference. Rather, consider focusing on internal governance under proposed Item 106 and leaving matters of the Board to Regulation S K. In practice there is far more required of senior management when it comes to cybersecurity governance than the Board. Specifically, the ratification of true policies is appropriate for an internal Cybersecurity Governance (CyberGov) committee, where senior managers such as Chief Financial Officers, Counsels General, or Chief Operating Officers can accurately debate the consequences of employee behavior requirements and potential improvements in security. Board level oversight, on the other hand, would be misdirected to read through lengthy policies, no less hundreds of discrete procedures. Ive commonly observed many of the elements being proposed for the Board in this section to manifest in proxy statements alongside Director qualifications, and I think it would be appropriate to move the following to section E. Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors Cybersecurity Expertise: Disclosure regarding whether and/or how the Board: ● approves the registrants cybersecurity strategy and priorities ● is regularly made aware of the registrants cybersecurity risks ● receives timely notification of urgent cybersecurity incidents ● oversees managements implementation and governance of cybersecurity programs Making this change would allow section D.2 to focus on management oversight, at which point the material therein would be appropriate. 26. Would proposed Item 407(j) disclosure provide information that investors would find useful? Should it be modified in any way? Disclosure requirements around Boardroom cybersecurity expertise can be viewed through one of two lenses: as the admission of some culpability or weakness; or as the confirmation of a noble behavior. As written, the proposal is not clear about which one it is pursuing. It would seem more congruent with the rest of the proposal that the latter is favored, in which case disclosure would indeed provide information that investors would find useful after the language is tailored appropriately. 27. Should we require disclosure of the names of persons with cybersecurity expertise on the board of directors, as currently proposed in Item 407(j)(1)? Would a requirement to name such persons have the unintended effect of deterring persons with this expertise from serving on a board of directors? Directors are already disclosed in proxy statements, generally alongside matrices showing their credentials and participation in various subcommittees. Cybersecurity expertise should be viewed as a credential or qualification, in which case Directors should not harbor any qualm about its assertion (née disclosure). 28. When a registrant does not have a person with cybersecurity expertise on its board of directors, should the registrant be required to state expressly that this is the case under proposed Item 407(j)(1)? As proposed, we would not require a registrant to make such an explicit statement. A requirement around holistic discussion of the Boards involvement in cybersecurity, including elements ported from section D.2, would support a requirement to disclose the lack of cybersecurity expertise in the Board. This approach would allow a hypothetical firm with minimal cybersecurity risk to identify a committee where cybersecurity is deliberated, the usage of a cyber consultant or Board advisor periodically, and resulting conclusions. In practice it is difficult to imagine a public company devoid of cyber risk, but prudent to structure requirements to accommodate such a firm. Likewise, any registrant with obvious cyber risk that used this process to dismiss the threat would risk the market consequences of the obvious folly. 29. Proposed Item 407(j) would require registrants to describe fully the nature of a board members expertise in cybersecurity without mandating specific disclosures. Is there particular information that we should instead require a registrant to disclose with respect to a board members expertise in cybersecurity? As the recently retired Chief Information Security Officer of ICE and the New York Stock Exchange in active pursuit of public Board Director positions, I naturally would stand to benefit from mandating a laundry list of specific cybersecurity expertise and experience. It must be acknowledged, however, that Directors will continue to be business leaders and experienced strategic decision makers that can add value across the full spectrum of Director responsibilities first, and experts in cybersecurity or any other specific subject matter second. Further, shifting the tone from encouraging firms to highlight cybersecurity experience as a positive versus disclosing it as an admission will drive an organic process of identifying relevant experience across existing and new Directors. Finally, requiring registrants to disclose Board level cybersecurity education  particularly that provided in house within the context of the registrants program  should encourage firms to provide briefings and enable existing Directors to expand their expertise. 30. As proposed, Item 407(j)(1) includes a non exclusive list of criteria that a company should consider in determining whether a director has expertise in cybersecurity. Are these factors for registrants to consider useful in determining cybersecurity expertise? Should the list be revised, eliminated, or supplemented? The list should be refined to prize adversarial risk management experience over policy or academic theory. Criteria should drive Boards toward selecting Directors with practical experience identifying threats, assessing susceptibility, closing gaps, and continuously testing to ensure management is not overlooking potential risks. 31. Would the Item 407(j) disclosure requirements have the unintended effect of undermining a registrants cybersecurity defense efforts or otherwise impose undue burdens on registrants? If so, how? No. The current state of cybersecurity has adversaries targeting any company of which they can discern the name, and there is not much room for increasing attention once a company is operating on any public stage. 32. Should 407(j) disclosure of board expertise be required in an annual report and proxy or information statement, as proposed? Focusing on the proxy will suit more registrants existing practices and avoid duplication. 33. To what extent would disclosure under proposed Item 407(j) overlap with disclosure required under Item 401(e) of Regulation S K with respect to the business experience of directors? Are there alternative approaches that would avoid duplicative disclosure without being cumbersome for investors? See previous comments about how cybersecurity expertise should be viewed as another business experience. To that end, it would not be irrational to consider treatment in 401(e), particularly if overall cyber governance, including the identification of committees that oversee cybersecurity, is retained in 407(j). 34. As proposed, Item 407(j) does not include a definition of the term expertise in the context of cybersecurity? Should Item 407(j) define the term expertise? If so, how should we define the term? The examples provided do an adequate job of explaining the term. 35. Should certain categories of registrants, such as smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, or FPIs, be excluded from the proposed Item 407(j) disclosure requirement? How would any exclusion affect the ability of investors to assess the cybersecurity risk of a registrant or compare such risk among registrants? No. The value at risk for an investor is correlated with the value invested, and not the size of the registrant. As such, small firms not prioritizing cybersecurity risk may actually embody the most pressing cybersecurity risk to an investor. 36. Should we adopt the proposed Item 407(j)(2) safe harbor to clarify that a director identified as having expertise in cybersecurity would not have any increased level of liability under the federal securities laws as a result of such identification? Are there alternatives we should consider? Yes  this proposal is supportive of the notion that cybersecurity expertise should be considered an asset and not a liability. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important proposed rulemaking. The amount of time and expertise that the Commission invested into this effort is evident, and the work is a substantial improvement over previous attempts at cybersecurity regulation in other divisions. The proposed rules focus on the right outcomes while avoiding over prescription, and I look forward to being an investor, Director, and member of the public under them.

139,"Devin Lynch, SecurityScorecard",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20127882-289396.pdf,"Response from SecurityScorecard Comment on RIN 3235 AM89 (Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure) I. Introduction SecurityScorecard, the global leader in cybersecurity ratings, welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) proposed rule on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident disclosure for public companies.1 In particular, the SECs proposed rule focuses on ensuring the availability and comparability of public company disclosures across industries.2 The SECs work in this area is critical as cybersecurity risks to public companies grow and executives, shareholders, and customers seek greater clarity about appropriate approaches to cybersecurity risk management. As Congressman Jim Langevin (D RI) said during a recent House Committee on Homeland Security hearing, shareholders should be able to distinguish between companies that take [cyber] seriously.3 In this submission, we review why third party security ratings and assessments are a cost effective, comprehensive, and standardized way for organizations to assess and manage their cybersecurity risks—and an increasingly important component of cyber risk management programs. We also recommend that the SEC: ● Require public companies subject to SEC reporting requirements to report on incidents across their digital supply chain that materially impact their own cybersecurity, including with respect to third party risk (responding to Question 10); 3 House Committee on Homeland Security, Mobilizing Our Cyber Defenses: Securing Critical Infrastructure Against Russian Cyber Threats, April 5, 2022, https://homeland.house.gov/activities/hearings/mobilizing our cyber defenses securing critical infrastructure against r ussian cyber threats. 2 Ibid., 11. 1 RIN 3235 AM89. Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure. ● Require registrants to disclose updates of independent, metrics driven risk assessments in their quarterly and/or annual reports (responding to Question 15); ● Require registrants to disclose third party risk assessment scores as part of their disclosed cybersecurity policies, procedures, and governance (in response to Question 17); ● Recommend that registrants quantify their cybersecurity risk exposure through independent risk assessments that produce security ratings (in response to Question 42); ● Recognize that continuous monitoring and independent, metrics driven risk assessments are an increasingly cost effective, comprehensive, and standardized way for organizations to assess and manage their cybersecurity risks, given half of all data breaches occur through third party connections (responding to Questions 44 and 45); ● Recommend security ratings as a cost efficient and effective mechanism for board oversight of cybersecurity; and ● Recognize in general that organizations should employ continuous monitoring, including of vendors and supply chain companies, as a cybersecurity best practice. II. Security Ratings and Communicating Cyber Risk In its proposed rule, the SEC seeks to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies subject to 1934 Securities Exchange Act requirements.4 The SECs proposed rule focuses on mandating reporting about material cybersecurity incidents and requiring periodic disclosures about registrants cybersecurity risk management policies and board expertise and oversight.5 It also emphasizes the consistency of presentation 5 Ibid. 4 Ibid., 1. across public companies in different industries, to ensure comparability of disclosures.6 This last point is critical in providing the SEC with an understanding of the nations risk, not just the risk to individual companies. In order to comprehensively understand and communicate organizational cybersecurity risk, however, companies must first understand what the risks are and be able to quantify and prioritize mitigation efforts of those risks. As Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly testified to Congress in 2021, I think its hard to say youve reduced risk unless you know how to measure it. SecurityScorecard wholeheartedly agrees. You cant manage what you cant measure, and you cant defend what you cant see. To date, nearly all companies define that risk too narrowly, focusing nearly exclusively on the risks to their own digital infrastructure, even though half of all cyber incidents occur through third party digital connections.7 The cyber threat environment and organizations IT environments are also constantly evolving. To manage all this cybersecurity risk, organizations cannot use a playbook that relies on static analyses and entirely qualitative objectives. Instead, they must continuously assess cybersecurity risk across their entire supply chain and vendor ecosystem and produce quantitative metrics to measure that dynamic risk in a standardized, actionable way. Security ratings solve for both of these capability gaps by providing a quantifiable assessment of internal risk and continuous visibility of third party risk. That is why SecurityScorecard believes that security ratings are a necessary component for every cybersecurity policy and should be a required element of this rule. Third party assessments provide unique, valuable insights and metrics on an organizations cybersecurity posture and the credibility of its claims about that posture. When conducted independently, assessments validate for the public, 7 51% of organizations have experienced a data breach caused by a third party, Security Magazine, May 7, 2021. 6 Ibid., 11. investors, third party organizations like credit ratings agencies, and regulators that an organization is employing adequate cybersecurity measures. Especially when organizations are sourcing network and internet infrastructure components from a diverse and distributed global supply chain, third party assessments can help an organization understand how these components affect its exposure to cybersecurity risks—to identify, analyze, and then mitigate those risks. As part of this process, security ratings provide organizations with quantifiable cybersecurity metrics that can be easily communicated and compared against other similar metrics. Security ratings not only provide organizations with quantifiable cybersecurity metrics, ratings platforms like SecurityScorecards, easily and automatically communicate cybersecurity risks to senior leaders and Board Members. In Fig. 1 (Board Summary for securityscorecard.com), we show an example of how our platform continuously monitors and maps cyber risk against the industry average across 10 Risk Group factors. The Board Summary provides an overall security score, and a cybersecurity health overview for your company and vendors. This automated reporting provides clear metrics for IT, C suite, and Board of Directors leadership to track cyber risk and resource needs across the enterprise system, and make risk based decisions based on the underlying data driven analysis. SecurityScorecards A F security ratings platform offers rigorous, free cybersecurity self assessments to customers, and cost effective assessments for their third party vendors and suppliers. We conduct daily scans of the entire internet to map cybersecurity risk exposure and bring transparency to an organizations cyber hygiene. We do this without going behind any firewalls, only collecting public facing data. We offer an outside in perspective on an organizations security posture: we give organizations the ability to see what a hacker would see and are thus able to generate insights about the vulnerabilities, active exploits, and advanced cyber threats that a specific organization faces. Our customers use our platform not only to identify weaknesses in their own enterprise cyber hygiene, but to support their vendor risk management and supply chain security initiatives as well. Figure 2 We generate our ratings (i.e., scores) by drawing on publicly available information, weighted and combined with historical data, to produce an objective security score. Importantly, this score, and the analytics behind it, change dynamically in response to changes in an organizations exposure to risks: if an organizations cyber hygiene starts to deteriorate, its score will suffer. While a high score does not translate to immunity from cyber risk, poor scores are strongly correlated with increased likelihood of breach. This is unsurprising, as a poor score reflects that an organization has not sufficiently hardened its infrastructure against malicious actors, as the data in Fig. 2 reveals.  Our mission is To make the world a safer place by transforming the way companies understand, improve, and communicate cybersecurity risks to their Boards, employees, and vendors. We offer a comprehensive picture of an organizations risk landscape alongside standardized, actionable security metrics. This kind of solution empowers organizations to accomplish many tasks: ● Continuously monitor their entire cyber risk exposure, including third party vendors and suppliers; ● Choose the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to prioritize and address cyber risk; ● Evaluate the effectiveness of existing internal security controls, tools, and processes; ● Identify potential gaps in security; ● Track remediation and mitigation efforts in real over time; ● View cybersecurity progress improvements over time; ● Monitor and compare performance with industry competitors; ● Oversee third party vendor cybersecurity; and ● Improve communication with vendors, regulators, and the board. Security ratings are also cost effective. Any organization can access their own security rating for free and scale their vendor risk management program to meet their needs. This is especially valuable for small and medium size businesses as well as local governments, who may not have the resources to employ a dedicated IT team or to contract IT services to defend their networks from cyber and vendor related risks. We can also help organizations to tailor their continuous monitoring and security metrics to their specific business needs. Security ratings are additionally cost effective because they help build long term capacity to manage cyber risk. As cyber threats evolve and as the IT environment changes, organizations can easily update security metrics in response—because they already have a risk assessment and security metrics framework in place. Security ratings are especially powerful tools for board oversight of an organizations cybersecurity risk management. As an example of the crisp, easy to understand data that security ratings can furnish directors, we include a copy of the report that we provide to our board using our platform (Attachment 1). For these reasons, security ratings are rapidly emerging as an essential element of cybersecurity risk management. According to CISAs then Assistant Director for the National Risk Management Center: The emergence of security ratings has driven cyber risk quantification as a way to calculate and measure cyber risk exposure. These security ratings provide a starting point for companies cybersecurity capabilities and help elevate cyber risk to board decision making. Entities can also use security ratings alongside strategic risk metrics to align cyber scenarios with material business exposure; rollup cyber risks with financial exposure to inform risk management decisions; and measure improvement of cyber risk reduction over time. This kind of work needs to happen in the boardroom and also amongst national security leaders. III. Recommendations Security ratings should be an essential element of any organizations comprehensive strategy for managing cyber risks. Interconnected technology infrastructure sourced from a distributed, global, and diverse supply chain brings many possible risks. Static, point in time assessments of cybersecurity provided by a supplier are inadequate in a constantly evolving threat environment, and organizations in general may lack a comprehensive understanding of where a technology came from and its embedded risks. Security ratings also enable organizations to understand their own risk posture—screening an entire organizations digital and contractor supply chain to identify risks and quantitatively measure them. Importantly, these measurements are cost effective: technologies to perform them are widely available, and once organizations conduct one such assessment, subsequent assessments can build on those ratings to continually update cybersecurity risk assessments. Third party assessments, such as the security ratings offered by SecurityScorecard, can help public companies protect themselves and their customers against cybersecurity risks. Getting a more comprehensive, quantitative picture of an organizations digital supply chain empowers that organization to identify and target cybersecurity risks. Security ratings can also ensure that organizations better understand their network technologies while they procure them, before they deploy them, and as they maintain them. Further, security ratings provide a measurable, standardized, and cost effective way of assessing an organizations cybersecurity, including vis à vis their contractor and digital supply chains. The answer is yes registrants have cost effective options for obtaining actionable insights into cybersecurity risks affecting their vendors and business partners. Accordingly, we recommend, in response to Question 10, that the SEC require registrants to report on incidents across their digital supply chain, including with respect to third party risk. Security ratings platforms are an increasingly cost effective way to survey an organizations entire digital supply chain and produce quantified, standardized security ratings. Hence, more organizations are using continuous monitoring and security ratings to monitor supply chain incidents. This kind of supply chain assessment—across vendors, contractors, third party technologies, and other points of cyber risk to an organization—is critical to cybersecurity risk management. In response to Question 15, we recommend that the SEC require registrants to provide updates in the form of independent, metrics driven risk assessments in their quarterly or annual reports. Part of the value add of security ratings is that they allow an organization to compare its current cybersecurity risk posture to previous points in time, as well as to that of competitors. By supplying updates to third party risk assessments, registrants would provide boards and regulators with this kind of quantified cybersecurity risk rating to similarly assess the organizations current cybersecurity posture and its efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk. In response to Question 17, we recommend that the SEC require registrants to disclose third party risk assessment scores as part of their disclosures on cybersecurity policies, procedures, and governance. The SECs proposal for Item 106 disclosures includes policies and procedures around cybersecurity (Item 106(b)), board and management oversight of cybersecurity (Item 106(c)), and cybersecurity incidents (Item 106(d)).8 Independent, third party risk assessments that produce security metrics empower organizations to monitor risk across their entire supply chain, as well as to understand and communicate that risk in a quantified fashion. These risk assessments across the supply chain are an increasingly essential part of cybersecurity risk management—and would provide useful information on a registrants cybersecurity policies and procedures. In response to Question 42, we recommend that registrants quantify their cybersecurity risk exposure through independent risk assessments that produce security ratings. Entirely qualitative cybersecurity risk assessments can be 8 RIN 325 AM89. 92. difficult to understand, challenging to verify, and hard if not impossible to compare directly to those from other organizations. Using quantified cybersecurity ratings, however, enables organizations to understand their risk numerically, map their risk over time and against competitors, and communicate that risk to stakeholders—from regulators to the board. Independent, third party risk assessments are increasingly cost effective, comprehensive, and standardized, helping organizations produce those kinds of quantified cyber risk metrics. In Questions 44 and 45, the SEC seeks comment on the possible compliance costs imposed on organizations by the proposed disclosure requirements. We recommend that the SEC recognize that continuous monitoring and independent, metrics driven risk assessments are becoming lower cost and more comprehensive—giving organizations an efficient and effective way to manage their cybersecurity risk. SecurityScorecard actually provides self monitoring of a companys own digital footprint  the IP addresses that the company itself owns  for free to any organization. In addition, given that half of all data breaches occur through third party connections,9 security ratings that furnish insight into these risks are vital for maintaining a robust cybersecurity risk management program. In considering proposed requirements for public companies to report on the boards cybersecurity expertise and oversight, we recommend that the SEC recommend security ratings as a cost efficient and effective mechanism for demonstrating compliance. Given the general lack of cybersecurity expertise among corporate boards, quantified ratings of an organizations cybersecurity risk are easy for a board to understand and widely comparable to the ratings of competitors, others in the industry, and what are considered best practices. SecurityScorecard couples its 1 100 security rating with an A F grade that 9 51% of organizations have experienced a data breach caused by a third party,Security Magazine, May 7, 2021, https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/95143 of organizations have experienced a data breach caused by a third party. simplifies the information even further. Organizations can also generate security ratings on a continuous basis—including for boards to review—to demonstrate they are properly overseeing their risk posture and maintaining up to date cybersecurity risk management processes. We also recommend that the SEC, in general, recognize that organizations should employ continuous monitoring as a cybersecurity best practice. Static assessments of cyber risk in a complex world are insufficient to protect organizations and their users, vendors, and other constituents. This is especially so given that organizations have increasingly globally distributed and sourced technology supply chains—alongside complex relationships with third parties. Continuous monitoring, paired with independent and metrics driven risk assessments, empowers organizations to understand their updated risk profile effectively and at low cost.

Crenshaw and Hester M. Peirce  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street NE 100 F Street NE  Washington, DC 20549 Re: Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, File number S7 09 22 Dear SEC Commissioners: I am writing to provide support from academic evidence regarding the SECs recent proposal on enhancing disclosure requirements related to cyber security events, file number S7 09 22. Cybersecurity is an increasingly important risk as nearly 50% of 4,446 CEOs surveyed across 89 countries view it as a top threat (PWC 2022). The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (2018, p.16) argues cybersecurity may have become the most important near term threat to financial stability [of the economy]. Further, shareholders perceive it as a significant risk to a firms growth prospects (PwC 2018).  Not only is cyber risk important and eminent, but data breaches can also be costly. Survey evidence suggests that data breaches can be costly to the firm in terms of loss of revenue, customers, and/or business opportunities (Cisco 2017). Ponemon Institute (2017a) provides evidence that, on average, firms incur $225 in total costs per record exposed in a data breach. Recent research suggests data breaches have costly valuation implications such as an undiversifiable priced risk factor, higher cost of debt, lower sales growth, and lower financial reporting quality (Florakis et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Cisco 2017; Ponemon Institute 2017b; Sheneman 2017; Lawrence et al. 2018; Janakiraman, Lim, and Rishika 2018; Smith, Higgs, and Pinsker 2018; Huang and Wang 2020; Kamiya et al. 2021; Ashraf and Sunder 2021). Ponemon Institute (2017b) finds that the average breached firm experiences a five % drop in stock price after disclosing a breach.  Collectively, this evidence suggests that investors generally find cyber incident disclosures are value relevant.1 Much academic research suggests there is an important link between information  1 Ashraf (2021) findings suggest such information may also be relevant to peer firms is assessing and evaluating their cyber exposure, even in the absence of a successful attack. 2  technology and internal controls (e.g., Messier, Eilifsen and Austen 2004; Li, Peters, Richardson, and Watson 2012), with valuation implications when there are deficiencies. We believe the academic evidence generally suggests there is value and importance in disclosing data breach incidents for many reasons. Below we provide more detail regarding specific points raised in the SECs proposal and the related academic findings. 1. Costs and benefits of mandating cyber disclosures Generally speaking, academic research finds that mandating disclosure reduces strategic behavior. More specifically, in the context of cyber disclosures, Ashraf, Jiang, and Wang (2022) conduct a study where they contrast firms headquartered in states that mandate deadlines for disclosing cyber incidents with those that do not have such requirements. Not surprisingly, they find that firms in states that mandate cyber incident disclosure deadlines disclose 90% more quickly than those without mandated deadlines, highlighting the ability to improve disclosure timeliness with laws that mandate timing. Mandated disclosure may increase media coverage of breaches (Romanosky, Telang, and Acquisiti 2011), highlighting additional spillover that improves awareness for investors and potentially impacted customers. Customers with compromised data may better be able to protect themselves from the negative implications of the breach with enhanced disclosure, as disclosure may enhance the ability of affected individuals to seek recourse from breached firms through litigation (e.g., Jones Day 2003). Finally, mandated disclosure may inform peers about potential cyber risks and motivate firms to take real actions to prioritize mitigating cyber risk exposure, reducing the occurrence and financial impact (Ashraf and Sunder 2021). This is consistent with research in other contexts that finds people take real actions to reduce bad outcomes on behalf of stakeholders in response to mandatory disclosure (e.g., Jin and Leslie 2003; Cutler et al. 2004; Lu 2012; Kolstad 2013). The ability of mandated disclosure to reduce the risk of bad outcomes is important because Accenture (2014) reports that 45% of chief information officers perceive they have underinvested in cybersecurity. Further, research evidence supports that mandated disclosure is more effective at reducing the cost of capital relative to voluntary disclosure as it makes non disclosure more informative. Mandated disclosure laws may also increase the likelihood of retaining cybersecurity expertise in the top management team (Ashraf and Sunder 2021). Ashraf, Jiang, and Wang (2022) find a negative market response in general to delaying cyber disclosures, suggesting investors value timely cyber incident disclosures. Their analysis also points to a potential cost of increased timeliness. Specifically, nearly 60% of the firms subject to mandated disclosure deadlines provide less detailed disclosures. Further, investors do not have a negative response to disclosure delays motivated by increasing the informativeness of such disclosures. This response points to a trade off between timeliness and more informative disclosures. The SEC may want to keep this trade off in mind and consider ways to combat it. More specifically, delayed disclosures that have enhanced detail are not penalized. This suggests the SEC may also want to mandate what information must be disclosed along with the timing, allowing for updated disclosures that omit full details (if unavailable by the deadline) to achieve the improved timeliness and maintain informativeness of the disclosures.  3  Ashraf (2021) points to a potential unintended cost of mandating disclosures. He finds evidence that more unique and informative cyber risk factor disclosure is present in the absence of mandated requirements by the SEC to make such disclosures. In other words, mandating such cyber risk factor disclosures is associated with more generic and less informative disclosure. However, we note that this evidence is specific to disclosing anticipated bad news in the form of risk disclosures, rather than reporting news of a negative event that occurred, which the current SEC proposal covers. Overall, we still believe investors would benefit from clarity about the timing of such required disclosure and more prescription regarding the content of the disclosure.  2. Strategic Disclosure Concerns We believe there is value to mandating such disclosures as many cyber incidents may be unreported. Separation of ownership and control, and the existence of externalities, gives rise to opportunistic behavior on behalf of managers (e.g., Jensen and Meckling 1976). Mandating disclosure of cyber events can reduce strategic disclosure, but likely not eliminate it completely.  Choudhary, Sigler, and Ramadas (2021) find a correlation between cyber incidents and the complexity of a companys information technology system related to financial reporting. Companies with the most complex IT financial reporting system (highest complexity across locations, number of customized, purchased, and in house applications, end user access, IT modifications, and number of servers) have cyber incidents about 6.4% of the time.2 Unfortunately, details of IT complexity and, therefore, cyber exposure are typically not provided to investors, highlighting even more value of disclosing cyber incidents as it can provide a signal regarding a companys IT complexity and related controls, which they show have implications for financial reporting reliability.  The current proposal may subject the disclosure decision to an unstated materiality threshold, introducing the possibility of strategic behavior. Specifically, companies are not required to provide investors with quantitative or qualitative materiality disclosures applied in filing financial reporting or related disclosures. Therefore, companies can strategically use such judgment discretion when establishing materiality (e.g., Thompson 2020; Black, Choudhary, and Goodman 2022). Hence, we encourage the SEC to consider requiring companies to disclose the qualitative and quantitative materiality applied in determining this and other financial disclosures to reduce the possibility of such behavior as part of the periodic filings already required. 3. Value of disclosing board expertise related to cybersecurity Finally, research generally supports the value of IT related expertise. Survey evidence indicates that audit committees do not easily understand emerging technology risks (KPMG global survey,  2 In our revised paper we intend to disclose how many cyber incidents in our sample were not publicly disclosed in an SEC filing or new release, subject to PCAOB board approval. However, it is unclear if they unreported incidents are not disclosed because management views the incident as immaterial or if they were unreported for other reasons such as unsuccessful attack. 4  2014). Ashraf, Michas, and Russomanno (2020) find that information technology expertise on audit committees is associated with a reduction in the propensity of material restatements, a reduction in the propensity of information technology material weaknesses, and more timely earnings announcements highlighting important benefits from this type of expertise and value to disclosing it. They define an IT expert as someone who has worked as a chief information officer or in an IT management role. Their evidence indicates that firms with audit committee IT expertise are 32 % less likely to have a material restatement, 32.6 % less likely to have an IT related material weakness and announce earnings two days earlier (or about 4 % faster relative to the sample mean). Overall, this suggests an important link between IT expertise and financial reporting reliability and disclosure timeliness and generally supports the SECs initiative to promote such expertise. Finally, disclosure requirements about cyber expertise may lead companies to focus on recruiting this expertise more frequently, leading to better outcomes. Thank you for considering what we learn from academic evidence. We hope the Commission is able to consider this and other evidence in support of mandated disclosures of cyber incidents.

142,"Madhuri Trivedi, Engineer, entreprenuer , product development, cybersecurity professional",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20127840-289033.pdf,"I thought to write short comment  1. Cybersecurity rule amendment is a good first baby step that SEC.gov is taking. As a career engineer, cybersecurity professional  (though now I am so burnt. And I find cybersecurity field dreadful, full of apathy); I like that…though entire new division at SEC.gov for handling cybersecurity would be necessary and required EVENTUALLY. It is the mindset of management  as I have already replied to SEC.gov twitter handle about this rulemaking  a separate DIVISION  more professionals at SEC handling, auditing, enforcing cybersecurity would be needed. And as I asked that are you creating a separate division for this? 2. Frank Abagnale, the infamous impostor turned security advisor, said  Every breach, without exception, happens because somebody in that company did something they werent supposed to do or somebody failed to do something they were supposed to do—didnt fix its tech, it didnt update patches, so the hackers got millions of pieces of data.  3. Like SOX internal controls and audit that came out  after ENRON  similar to what I experienced at GE….cybersecurity internal controls implementation and audit is a MUST SEC has not done/ proposed any rulemaking in this regard; and hope that it will be done in the future, we can only hope…  4. SEC prosed rule does not specifically state how company should report ZERO day vulnerability  rulemaking says Incident  does zero day vulnerability mean Incident that is Material in terms of SECs definition of reporting ?  which could be result of poorly done product/service, self inflicted misery , company having SLACKER type approach, serious defect in code, design, deployment, system  that has led to finding of zero day vulnerability by someone else….when company issues public patch about zero day vulnerability ( as well as CISA, NIST cybersecurity alerts as mentioned below)  it would be better to put that in SEC filing  so stake holders  those who I believe read SEC regulatory filings  would be better informed.  5. SEC rule amendment states that Specifically, we are proposing amendments to require current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents. Does it mean that companys CISA, NIST and CVE cybersecurity alerts are MATERIAL INCIDENTS and should/MUST be reported as part of this amendment? There is not much clarity on what is MATERIAL, and it is likely that it will be subjective  May be SEC can specifically mention that any alerts issued through CISA.gov, NIST, CVE  with score above this MUST be reported to SEC. Because this is a PROACTIVE step….in a long run  investors would be educated about how many alerts company is issuing and of what Severity, how much bad things are, how quickly company is ISSUING PUBLIC ALERT after coming to know about it, how management is handling it…this is a way to address risk, liability and damage to public, patient, investor , employee data, systems, and more—entire universe that cybersecurity touches OR say anything connected on internet.  SEC rule amendment states that Disclosure of Cybersecurity Incidents that Have Become Material in the Aggregate  which is more than welcome. Punishes serial offender and forces them to disclose. And companys approach to fix issues in PRODUCTION, worry later and benefit now because we are in hurry to (1) go to market(2) in hurry to capture market share (3)we dont want to spend money initially (4) just slacker approach and mindset (5) who cares  thinking that no one is going to jail  worst will pay some fine someday if at all, if regulatory agency comes after but in the mean time we have generated 10 50 times revenue, profit, captured market share and more  that comparatively paying a fine which would be 1 5 % at the MOST of the amount revenue was generated, profit, captured market share and time to go to market….and this is all calculated by management as I have seen first hand  managers think this way and do this way so    6. SEC Rule for internal whistleblower  proposed rulemaking does not mention anything about it.  In 2020, when SEC amended SEC rule 21F 2 to incorporate supreme court ruling in Digital realty v. Somers ; and removed protection for internal reporting  two commissioners ( Ms. Lee and Ms. Crenshaw) voted against it, where commissioner quoted history of whistleblower dated back to 1776 ; what founding father of America did back then ( entire history is that because of the whistleblower reporting  naval commander had to leave his post ) I had submitted comments for rule making; but voting was 3 2 by commissioners and then SEC chairman Jay Clayton( who voted against it though I had emailed at commissioners and chairman, general counsel email address about not to remove it)  Since SEC is already amending rule and based on my detailed phone conversation with SEC.GOV senior attorney  SEC has to follow what supreme court ruled about in Digital Realty v. Somers case as definition of whistleblower  meaning those who report to SEC ONLY and not internal whistleblower. Currently two bills in house and senate are pending since 2019; those bills amend current whistleblower definition and add those who report internally as well. So there is some congressional intent. It is likely that congress people knows about my lawsuit (I have already mentioned those bills in my lawsuit filing in 2019)and GE has lots of lobbying power  so these two bills are sitting idle since 2019….  So coming back to my discussion….this is a good way to make SEC rule for cybersecurity more effective by adding internal reporting protection.  7. Currently there is NOT any SPECIFIC statute or rule  specific to cybersecurity whistleblowing and/or reporting. Most of the time employee would report to management  internally and try to fix it / address it. 8. SEC rule amendment about Board skill and expertise is really a great step in my case  I had right from beginning emailed GE board of director about security issues at GE healthcare and ; she had replied that she was as a board member of GE  too high to deal with individual complaint….but then from next SEC.GOV filings  it shows that that same board of director was assigned cybersecurity oversight at GEand she had a BIOLOGY background.  GE 2019 proxy statement  page 17 BOARD SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE Technology Experience As a digital industrial company 9. Proactively changing culture where speaking up of  bring up cybersecurity vulnerability is not a SIN  and without fear of retaliation. Those employee who DISCLSOE cybersecurity vulnerabilities, VERY FIRS, and INSTANTLY get a status of Persona non grata ; because disclosing in PUBLIC vulnerability means exposing  weakness 10. Changing culture of cybersecurity, proactively addressing issue throughout product, software, system LIFE CYCLE DEVELOPMENT starting form functional requirement, product requirement specification to design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance  would require lots of cultural changes, changes in funding, management mindset, not to be overconfident, be realistic, not to cut corners, and also status quo , all these can be achieved by putting back old SEC rule 21F 2 ‘s internal reporting whistleblower protection and not that only those who report to SEC are protected under Dodd Frank act… 11. GE removed in SEC 10 K and /or DEF 14 A  So GE REMOVED/STOPPED putting BELOW SECTION entirely from February 24, 2019 till present 2022 in SEC 10 K filing with securities & exchange commission; after Trivedi sent email  on January 2019 to Culp, GE board of directors about Remote connectivity and wrote that Trivedi would be filing a lawsuit against GE. and GE has since REMOVED that section from SEC 10 k altogether…  SEC.gov website; searching GEs public filing with SEC Filing 10 K  For year 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 mentions INSITEEXC as follow Item 7 operationsSIGNIFICANT TRENDS & DEVELOPMENTS MD&A  Healthcare SEGMENT  Our product services include remote diagnostic and repair services for medical equipment manufactured by GE and by others, as well as computerized data management and customer productivity services.

In response to feedback received from our directors in 2014, the Board determined to adjust the compositions of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee in light of the increased demands on both of these committees and formalize and strengthen the Audit Committees oversight responsibility for cybersecurity.  13. Data breach of employees personally identifiable information, third party liability  SEC proposed rules states that iii) The registrant has policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third party service provider, including, but not limited to, those providers that have access to the registrants customer and employee data.  This is to the point  and I liked it too.   In re GE/CBPS DATA BREACH LITIGATION (1:20 cv 02903 KPF) District Court, S.D. New York  https://www.courthousenews.com/author/courthouse news staff/  Corporate negligence Brief / August 4, 2021  NEW YORK — A federal judge ruled that General Electric employees may sue Canon and GE after a data breach at the imaging company resulted in the release of GE employees personally identifiable information. GEs policy documents may be read as implied contracts that gave its employees reason to believe it would protect employees personal information, including information provided to third party vendors.   On February 21, 2022 GE reached a settlement for this class action lawsuit. Atleast one judge was doing her job. Judge ruled that  [T]he Supreme Court has made clear that ‘allegations of possible future injury or even an ‘objectively reasonable likelihood of future injury are insufficient to confer standing. McMorris, 995 F.3d at 300 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Intl USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 10 (2013)). Rather, a future injury may support standing only if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur. Id. (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014)).  Judge Katherine Polk Faillas order denying GEs motion to dismiss  dated August 4, 2021. In this ruling  at risk ,future injury has been shown enough to prove injury and thus ARTICLE III standing. 14. GE or a COMPANYs MINDSET on CYBERSECURITY as shown in an example below  remote connectivity is better than defects ( below is GE architect Bill Barbiaux deposition; which has been part of my lawsuit filings)  Q So your  Im talking about  Im just consolidating everything in one sentence. Your point was connectivity is better than defects in Insite ExC. At the least we would have connectivity? A Right. Q And some are unresolved for ten years, which is, as you said, not acceptable. But given that there was no alternative, it went on? A Right. And like I said, it was purchased software, so I dont know that any of these were really ten years old because we werent even in production at that point, but they may be.  15. At GE healthcare, as GE architect testified in his deposition  that the remote connectivity platform failed all security tests on DAY1  on a public facing web; so GE Healthcare  moved connectivity platform INSIDE GEs network INTRANET. And choose not to fix any of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities  for those tests failed on DAY 1 and kept using the platform for several years…while old and new vulnerabilities were PILING up in terms of hundreds of critical design defects( in terms of FDA Food and Drug administrations language it is called Design nonconformance and critical defects) and vulnerabilities. Shouldnt there be some rule from SEC around this…to fix this kind of behavior and also force company to disclose such defects in cybersecurity. FDA has 21CFR820 QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATION Subpart I Nonconforming Product  but FDA is known to be administrative agency and not good at enforcing so ….my point is SEC should amend rule making for cybersecurity  non confirming product…. 16. This is the IOT internet of things event I did.  IoT Security: High Stakes for Billions of Devices https://vlab.org/events/iot security high stake billions devices/ The speed of Internet of Things (IoT) adoption is creating opportunities for startups developing IoT security solutions. Many industries such as healthcare, energy, automotive, and consumer products are being transformed using insights gained from the real time data that IoT provides. As new online devices continue to be added at exponential rates, the frequency of sophisticated cyber attacks targeting consumers, businesses, and public services is also increasing. Startups are competing against large corporations to establish themselves as leaders in IoT security. And the rewards leading the charge to protect against security breaches, hijacking, and individual privacy concerns is enormous. According to KBV Research, the IoT Security market expected to reach $29.2B by 2022.  Is the Internet of Things making us more vulnerable to attacks?  Given the anticipated growth in connected devices, will security solutions be able to keep pace?  What are the biggest challenges for startups working on IoT Security? ‘  17. As SEC staff and top brass knows about my matter that I have sued GE , GE Healthcare. Trivedi v. Gen. Elec. Co., CV 19 11862 PBS, District of Massacusetts and currently pending at first circuit  Trivedi v. General Electric et. al  No. 21 1434. Though judicary and judges are also corrupt. 18. As we all know GE has changed its marketing, PR and entire company profile as GE is a digital industrial company and all of its SEC.GOV regulatory filings also reflect that; while in reality  GE had stoneage cybersecurity practice  and Also in SEC.gov filings dated 2013 till date; it shows that GE painted ROSY picture , look trendy and cool of its digital solutions (Internet of Things platform);  As stated in SEC 8 K form; that its market is up to $8 billion and wants  everybody using it …   but GE totally failed to consider RISKS, liability even that putting many GE assets  where some GE assets are age OLD, due to several limitations of computing processing power, processing memory available; unable to get cyber security patches and upgrades due to these reasons   This is misleading given that GE has lessons to be learned at the same time was recklessly, negligently connecting all kinds of assets on internet.  19. Also SEC should include disclosure of annual training of staff and management. There must be mandatory training that company reports it undertook for its employees. 20. Below is Cybersecurity related CISA.gov alerts…these are portion of ALERTS related to healthcare and REMOTE CONNECTIVITY but complete list is available on cisa.gov. My point to mention it here is that SEC proposed rulemaking to INCLUDE such cybersecurity alerts through CISA, NIST ; and over period of time  aggregate of such alerts, how it MATERIALLY impacted customers, users, patients, employees, society  how company handled it, when it was reported and when it became public when PATCH was released, when recall was done…These alerts are Material information. But current rulemaking language is not clear about it. Some catalog of cybersecurity vulnerabilities alert GE issues through CISA  department of homeland security  there is long list on cisa.gov. Item 1 is holy grail Scott Erven  cybersecurity researcher reported first to GE about it in 2014 as it affect 100s of 1000s of medical devices specifically and exactly what GE is touting in all their SEC filings as robust ( and it also involves InsiteEXC remote connectivity platform  the one that Trivedi is fighting for), with lack of internal controls and more. And GE knew it ; but nor GE or DHS, cared to issue alert for 4 years and randomly  issued alert on Feb. 2018. Since 2014  there was a lot of press and media coverage about Scott Ervens finding. At that time, GE shrugged off and didnt give a damn. Scott Erven himself ahs been surprised about this kind of inaction by GE  So my point is SEC rulemaking should include  clause where company is required to issue cybersecurity alert  no matter what  regardless of looking bad, being exposed, tarnishing of companys image and what not by certain time limit  and not wait for 4 years  currently this part is in VACCUM  no specific mention about it in proposed rule.  Latest in December 2020, GE is issuing alert through DHS for remote connectivity issues— So as SEC proposed rule suggest  previous undisclosed incidents in aggregate to be reported and disclosed as material…It shows a pattern.  1.

The complexity of the SECs cybersecurity rulemaking warrants additional time for at least three reasons:  • The Commissions proposed amendments include an array of reporting, risk management and strategy, and governance topics that are highly detailed and would have important impacts on publicly traded companies, investors, and U.S. economic and national security (e.g., public private partnerships). Alone, this section covers some 40 questions for commenters. 1 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or the Commission), Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Federal Register (FR), March 23, 2022. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/23/2022 05480/cybersecurity risk management strategy governance and incident disclosure https://www.sec.gov/news/press release/2022 39  • Many stakeholders have likely focused on the proposed amendments, yet the economic analysis portion of the rule covers many lengthy and intricate studies (some of which require purchasing) that the public deserves time to thoroughly read and formulate responses.  • In addition to this cybersecurity rulemaking, the Commission is promulgating several other rules affecting the business community that have overlapping comment periods and divide the time and attention of industry professionals. The SECs decision to put forth multiple proposals, combined with short comment periods, raises concerns about the adequacy of the Commissions rule writing process.  An additional 45 days would allow stakeholders appropriate time to craft  well reasoned feedback that is informed by a substantial consideration of the rulemaking and its implications for the cybersecurity of the United States and of U.S. companies.

145,"Rod Hackman, Board Member leading Cybersecurity Oversight",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20127841-289034.pdf,"Comments from Rod Hackman on proposed SEC Rule issued on March 9, 2022, regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management, Governance, and Disclosure  Introduction: The opinions expressed in these comments are my personal views and do not reflect the opinions of any entity I am affiliated with. I have led the cybersecurity oversight function for the past six years for an SEC registrant. The proposed SEC rulemaking is a major step in the right direction to address the gap in governance, disclosure, and oversight for cybersecurity. My views are informed by the attached document Closing the Cybersecurity Governance Gap. This gap results from the combination of a lack of will, culture and knowledge at the board level and the challenge many CISOs face in communicating cybersecurity issues to the board and senior management. The unfortunate result is too often a check the box superficial approach to cybersecurity governance at the board level. Comment #1: Definition of and Criteria for cybersecurity expertise: My concern relates to the proposed Item 407(j) which addresses cybersecurity expertise. While I agree that a strict definition is unwise, I believe that the non exclusive list is too narrowly focused on cybersecurity thereby inviting boards to adopt another check the box remedy by adding a CISO type to their ranks and relegating all matters cybersecurity to that individual. Cybersecurity expertise possessed by CISOs is surely a necessary component, but alone is insufficient to properly deal with systemic contextual issues related to cybersecurity. For example, some CISOs primarily deal with compliance issues related to various regulatory requirements such as NIST, ISO, GDPR, etc. but do not possess a broader understanding of cybersecurity governance. Compliance is essential for the enterprise but is only a subset of cybersecurity governance. Cybersecurity is one component of enterprise risk management (ERM). Cyber risk is a form of systemic risk. Therefore, cybersecurity governance requires at least a high level understanding of complex systems. SEC registrants operate complex business enterprises which face major persistent systemic risk. Below is an excerpt from NISTIR 8286 which describes the complexity of major enterprise systems. Excerpt from NISTIR 8286: Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management  Paragraph 2.2.4 Increasing System and Ecosystem Complexity  Many systems upon which agencies and other institutions rely are complex, adaptive systems of systems composed of thousands of interdependent components and myriad channels. The systems operate in a rapidly changing socio political technological environment that presents threats from individuals and groups with shifting alliances, attitudes, and agendas.  The constant introduction of new technologies has changed and complicated cyberspace. Wireless connections, big data, cloud computing, and IoT present new complexities and concomitant vulnerabilities. Information and technology no longer represent the simple, automated filing system. Rather, they are like the central nervous system—a delicately balanced and intricate part of any organization or enterprise that coordinates and controls the most fundamental assets of most organizations. This ecosystems increasing complexity gives rise to systemic risks and exploitable vulnerabilities that, once triggered, can have a runaway effect with multiple, severe consequences for enterprises and the Nation. Managing cybersecurity risk for these ecosystems is incredibly challenging because of their dynamic complexity.  This complexity increases risk to specific systems and that risk can cascade to create additional risk at the system, organization, and enterprise levels. Moreover, emerging risk conditions created by the interdependence of systems and counterparty risk must also be identified, tracked, and managed.  My recommendation is to expand the non exclusive list in Item 407(j) to include in the boardroom individuals with a contextual understanding of the interworking of complex systems, i.e., those with experience in operating or designing complex systems.  Comment #2: Definition of Cybersecurity  I suggest defining cybersecurity without using the word in the definition. Below are definitions provided by NIST and CISA.  NIST.SP.800: Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.  Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA): Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.  ATTACHMENT  CLOSING THE CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE GAP 1. It seems we hear about cyber attacks daily. What is the Boards role in dealing with this problem? Answer: Yes, we are constantly being bombarded with cybersecurity problems to the point where Boards are becoming desensitized to breaches unless they directly affect their company or industry sector. This is a massive problem in both the private and public sectors. The Boardroom must actively engage in oversight to deal with it. However, moving the needle on Board oversight and governance solutions remains elusive. Boards ask questions but are challenged to put cyber risk in the context of the infrastructure and risk controls in place for the enterprise they oversee. Boards need to understand the problem before they can govern it. The days of relegating this to the IT organization are over.  2. These attacks are pervasive, complex and seem to be overwhelming. How does the Boardroom begin to deal with them? Answer: Some companies, particularly those in the financial services industry, are dealing with cybersecurity effectively. However, many others are not. There have been numerous wake up calls for more effective Boardroom oversight: SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline and Microsoft Exchange, to name a few. In the case of SolarWinds, a derivative lawsuit has been filed against its directors. Board members understand this is a major issue but, given its size and complexity, they often struggle to find a roadmap to guide them in delivering effective governance and oversight. 3. So, what needs to happen to change that paradigm? Answer: To start with, Boards must accept and embrace cybersecurity oversight as a business issue requiring the attention of the entire Board. It is much more than an IT issue. The second step is for Boards to become more engaged and to continually resist a check the box approach to cybersecurity oversight, which is all too tempting given the size and complexity of the issue. Ask questions. Demand that the companys cybersecurity management professionals (generically referred to as CISOs) and outside experts explain cybersecurity threats, processes, and procedures in plain language, not technical jargon.   4. Assuming Boards are eager to engage and tackle cybersecurity, how do you recommend proceeding? Answer: I recommend a two pronged approach: top down and bottoms up. The top down approach starts with educating Boards, the C Suite and CISOs to think about their enterprises as systems (EAS). A system is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of elements comprising the enterprise. Only by understanding how the EAS works and mapping out the interactions of system components can enterprise cyber risk be fully understood and managed. A high level assessment of the EAS also puts a boundary around these complex problems, helps the Board understand the business issues, and enables the Boardroom and the C Suite/CSIOs to better communicate with one another. The results will be a contextual proactive approach rather than reactive approach to systemic cyber risk. Without an understanding of the EAS, cyber risk vulnerabilities cannot be put into context. With an understanding, design flaws, threat vectors and weak interfaces can be dealt with effectively: Other benefits ensue.  Engage management and outside advisors to map the EAS. Be aware that mapping and understanding the EAS is an ongoing and dynamic process. Be prepared to both routinely reevaluate the EAS and to reevaluate it in anticipation of, and BEFORE major changes are made to the enterprise, either internal or external, such as digital transformation, new technologies, introduction of new subsystems, changes in third party interfaces, acquisitions, divestitures etc. Too often, changes to the EAS caused by pursuing new business opportunities are made without considering their impact on enterprise wide cyber risk. Another element of the top down approach is to adopt a cyber risk management framework for the enterprise. There are several frameworks to choose from, such as NIST, ISO, SOC2, etc. The best framework is likely to be formed by selecting the best elements from each. To start this process, I recommend the NIST framework https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework . Why: 1) The concepts and processes are logical, intuitive, and easy to understand; 2) As you peel back the layers, the NIST framework offers excellent detailed procedures on how to deal with cyber risk within the context of overall enterprise risk management (ERM) (See NISTIR 8286 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8286.pdf); and 3) Draft congressional legislation mandates NIST as the basis for prospective guidance forthcoming from the SEC. The bottoms up approach begins with elevating the CISO and Internal Audit to present at the Board level and involving them in any changes to the EAS. This direct communications link is essential. Many companies employ good practices to mitigate cyber risk, but Boards need to know if these protections are too much or too little? Does the Board understand them from a business perspective? Is the EAS resilient? Are the most important assets and processes of the EAS being protected? Does the company need to do more? This is the world of risk assessment, vulnerability testing, tabletop exercises, etc., and threats such as ransomware, cloud, supply chain, platform, insider, and so on. How should the multitude of cyber risks be dealt with? This depends on the magnitude of their potential impact on the company and their likelihood of occurrence. Risks can be dealt with in four ways. They can be avoided, accepted with mitigation, transferred to a third party through insurance or ignored if minor. Cyber risk management is different for each company depending on the complexity and nature of its business. Cyber risk will never be zero. Balancing risk/reward will always be an ongoing challenge. Boards need to assess cyber risk within the context of the companys operations and strategy. The result will be the development of both a risk appetite and tolerance which optimizes cyber risk mitigation within budget constraints and minimizes the impact on the strategy and operation of the enterprise. Although seemingly overwhelming, cybersecurity can be understood within a business context at both the Board and C Suite/CISO level. Effective Board governance starts with active Board engagement with the C Suite/CISO. Active engagement will help the C Suite/CISO understand cyber risk from the Boards perspective and help the Board understand cyber risk from the C Suite/CISO perspective. As the top down and bottom up approaches develop and mature, they should merge to create optimal Board/Management engagement and enhanced cybersecurity for the enterprise.  5. Are Boards and committees properly organized to deliver effective cybersecurity oversight? Answer: While some are, many are not. Too often cybersecurity is dealt within the Audit committee, one which is already burdened with accounting and financial issues. Some companies stand up Risk committees. I think the best solution is a combined Tech & Risk committee which would be tasked with evaluating any changes to the EAS. The Tech function would evaluate the upside opportunity afforded by new business initiatives, while the Risk function would evaluate the potential downside and disruption to the EAS. However, a separate committee does not relieve the Boards responsibility to remain actively engaged in cyber risk oversight. In addition, I predict fundamental changes in the culture of todays Boards will be a result of ever increasing demands related to cybersecurity. Boards will have to work harder to get this right. At the same time, they are facing increasing liability as insurance companies charge more and cover less when it comes to the transference of cyber risk. The combination of more work and more risk will cause some Board members to rethink their roles, particularly in publicly traded companies. Just as Sarbanes Oxley made increased demands on companies, and in particular their Audit committees, cyber risk oversight (a much more complex job) will require more. It would be prudent for Boards to make changes today rather than wait for government regulators or market forces to dictate outcomes and put companies on the defensive.  6. You mentioned government regulators. How do you see government involvement in risk oversight? Answer: Just as we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number and seriousness of cyber incidents over the past few years, we have seen ever increasing involvement from government and regulators, from the White House on down, as they attempt to fix the problem. Whether it be through executive orders, legislation, or regulations, we can expect government involvement to accelerate. There is draft legislation requiring enhanced risk disclosure, cyber experts on boards and increased SEC scrutiny. Expect more! As regulatory intervention evolves, I expect legislators to mandate cybersecurity standards and dictate SOX like requirements for cybersecurity, despite the fact the cyber risk oversight is a much more complex problem than finance and accounting. My prediction is that these requirements will be based on the NIST framework and procedures.  7. What is your closing message to the Boardroom? Answer: Cyber risk is a business risk with the potential to negatively impact the value of your franchise due to a loss of operating capability and a loss of confidence by critical constituents. The demands made on Boards for systemic cyber risk oversight are increasing at an alarming rate with no end in sight. Yes, lets face it, implementing and managing cyber risk is the massively complex problem it seems to be. BUT, with the help of management and outside advisors, proactive Boards can and must understand and deal with this as the major business risk it is and apply the same judgement and oversight it applies to all other challenges and changes to their businesses.",2

We further urge you to coordinate the formulation of these rules with the National Cyber Director.  As you know, cybersecurity is among our most significant national security and economic challenges. Daily interactions increasingly take place in cyberspace, leading to more persistent and complex cybersecurity threats. Costs of cyber attacks have also been on the rise.  Investors often bear these costs because a serious cyber attack can permanently affect a companys valuation and profitability. During your most recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, you stated that you have asked the SEC staff to develop proposals on cybersecurity disclosures and incident reporting. You reiterated in public remarks last month that companies and investors would benefit if information on cybersecurity risk were presented in a consistent, comparable, and decision useful manner. We applaud your efforts to promote transparency and oversight of cybersecurity risks at public companies and at financial sector registrants like investment funds, investment advisers, and broker dealers. Investors deserve a clear understanding of whether companies and investment managers are prioritizing cybersecurity. They also have a right to prompt notification of serious cybersecurity incidents. More information will enable investors to hold companies and investment managers accountable. One effective regulatory approach would be asking public companies to disclose whether a cybersecurity expert is on the board of directors, and if not, why not. We have sponsored bipartisan legislation called the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act to require companies to provide this disclosure to investors. The bill does not tell companies how to deal with cybersecurity threats. How a company chooses to address cybersecurity risks would remain its own decision.  Boards of directors would be encouraged to develop approaches that address their own needs.  The goal is to encourage directors to play a more effective role in cybersecurity risk oversight. ES161127 Public companies and investment managers should pay attention to threats before they are realized. This is a better approach than scrambling to figure out what went wrong after investors have been harmed. Americas economic prosperity is linked to strong cybersecurity defenses in the private sector. The alternative unfortunately puts investors hard earned savings and pensions at risk.  We are encouraged that the SEC intends to address cybersecurity threats using a wide variety of tools, from raising the bar on risk management to clarifying when to report a serious breach that has already occurred. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Please keep our staffs informed of the SECs progress on improving cybersecurity disclosures and reporting by public companies and financial sector registrants.

We appreciate that you are looking to add language to disclose if a director has knowledge, skills, or other background in cybersecurity along with a certification or degree. You may want to look in using the NICE Framework from the US government which is becoming the template of what is needed for the workforce in cybersecurity and defining work roles. Here is the site  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied cybersecurity/nice/nice framework resource center As the largest organization that offers degrees and certifications in cybersecurity it would be great to have a conversation to see how we can help with your mission on this proposed rule. We are also glad to have you talk with our practitioners and top experts since you just want to be careful in the definition of expertise before making this disclosure a rule for public companies. For example, in critical infrastructure you see confusion on the definition of OT (Operational Technology) vs. IT where folks are considered experts when they have more an IT background. Even US DHS has stated: Incident response deployed in IT business systems may result in ineffective and even disastrous results when applied to ICS cyber incidents.

My company, Axio, was formed on the basis that cybersecurity is a problem that should be understood and managed from a business and financial standpoint, versus only from a technical perspective. Our methodology and software allow for enterprises to understand their cybersecurity risk from a financial impact perspective for better prioritization and decision making. In the process, the approach successfully aligns security and risk leaders, executives, and Board of Directors around a shared understanding of the most critical enterprise risks. Since weve been in business, Axio has continually seen major breakthroughs in terms of how our clients contend with the problem of cybersecurity:  • CEOs and Boards of Directors can finally understand cybersecurity risk and therefore provide the same oversight and governance that is provided to all other types of material enterprise risks. • When new threats, vulnerabilities or events are made public, security leaders can very quickly model the potential impact (or lack thereof) within their own organization, and more effectively determine if any mitigating actions should be taken.  • All key enterprise constituents achieve a better understanding of how cybersecurity events can impact the business and become more effective at minimizing impact if an event should occur. • Insurers are more receptive to enterprises that abide by this approach and will offer more sustainable and appropriately designed cyber insurance coverage.  All these outcomes differ starkly from the prevailing norm, where governance lacks, resources are misaligned, and enterprises fly blind to their most critical cybersecurity risks. Based on Axios experience and success in continually delivering these outcomes, translating to better protected and more resilient organizations, I have full confidence that the key components of the proposed cybersecurity rules are readily achievable and will have the desired impact on helping organizations far more effectively understand and manage cybersecurity risk. Please do not hesitate to reach out if myself or any of my Axio colleagues can be helpful to the SEC on this matter.

The PRI is a not for profit company with over 4,800 signatories (pension funds, insurers, investment managers and service providers) to the PRIs six principles with approximately US $121 trillion in assets under management.  The PRI supports its international network of signatories in implementing the Principles. As long term investors acting in the best interests of their beneficiaries and clients, our signatories work to understand the contribution that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors make to investment performance, the role that investment plays in broader financial markets and the impact that those investments have on the environment and society as a whole. The PRI works to achieve this sustainable global financial system by encouraging adoption of the Principles and collaboration on their implementation; by fostering good governance, integrity and accountability; and by addressing obstacles to a sustainable financial system that lie within market practices, structures and regulation. ABOUT THIS CONSULTATION The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission) is consulting on a series of proposed rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and cybersecurity incident reporting by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The proposed amendments would require, among other things, current reporting about material cybersecurity incidents and periodic reporting to provide updates about previously reported cybersecurity incidents. The proposal also would require periodic reporting about a registrants policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; the registrants board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risk; and managements role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures. The proposal further would require annual reporting or certain proxy disclosure about the board of directors cybersecurity expertise, if any. Cybersecurity is an important topic that investors seek standardized and transparent disclosure from public companies on. The PRI welcomes the opportunity to respond to the SECs consultation.  For more information, contact: Karen Kerschke US Policy Analyst Betina Vaz Boni Senior Analyst, Governance   3 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS The PRI welcomes the SECs proposals requiring greater transparency around companies cybersecurity practices. In the past, the PRI has encouraged signatories to consider cybersecurity risks because of the rising vulnerabilities of companies to cyber attacks. A 2019 report from Accenture, for example, found that cybersecurity breaches had risen by over 65% over the last five years1 and in 2020 the World Economic Forum identified cyber related issues as one of the top ten long term risks globally.2 Internationally, cybersecurity has been recognized as a significant threat to the integrity, efficiency and soundness of markets worldwide.3 Harms caused by cybersecurity attacks can be financial (e.g. fall in stock price, regulatory fines and legal fees, revenue loss from operational delays), reputational (e.g. damaged relationships with customers, intense media scrutiny and loss of key staff), societal (e.g. disruption to daily life through impacts on key services, a negative perception of technology), physical (e.g. loss of life, damage to infrastructure) and psychological (e.g. victims left depressed, embarrassed, shamed or confused).4  The PRIs research on cybersecurity has focused on governance aspects of cybersecurity disclosure. Therefore, the PRIs response will focus on this topic, although we are broadly supportive of the proposed rule.  The PRI supports the inclusion of the following disclosure requirements: ■ Disclosure of a registrants policies and procedures for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, covering especially the cybersecurity risks associated with its use of any third party service provider. ■ Disclosure of a registrants cybersecurity governance, including board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risks.  ■ Disclosure of a registrants managements role and relevant expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing related policies, procedures, and strategies. ■ Disclosure of the cybersecurity expertise of members of the board of directors.  The PRI further recommends that the Commission require: ■ Disclosure of the type and extent of training on cybersecurity to management and staff.   1 Accenture (2019), The Cost of Cybercrime: Ninth Annual Cost of Cybercrime Study (2019), available at https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF 96/Accenture 2019 Cost of Cybercrime Study Final.pdf.  2 World Economic Forum, The Global Risks Report 2020, available at https://www.weforum.org/reports/the global risks report 2020.  3 IOSCO, Cybersecurity in Securities Markets  An International Perspective (April 2016), available at https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD528.pdf.  4 University of Oxford, Researchers Identify Negative Impacts of Cyber Attacks (29 October 2019), available at https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018 10 29 researchers identify negative impacts cyber attacks. 4 DETAILED RESPONSE DISCLOSURE OF A REGISTRANTS RISK MANAGEMENT, STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE REGARDING CYBERSECURITY RISKS The PRI welcomes the proposal requiring registrants to provide more consistent and informative disclosure regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. The proposed disclosures would meet investors data needs on cybersecurity and governance. The PRI led research in the form of collaborative engagement from 2017 to 2019 on cybersecurity.5 Representing over US$12trn in assets, 55 institutional investors engaged 53 portfolio companies from five different sectors to understand how they are demonstrating preparedness and addressing cyber related risks, using governance as a proxy for resilience. The engagement revealed that although companies are increasingly recognising cyber risks and their impacts, their public disclosures do not provide investors with the information necessary to evaluate whether companies have adequate governance structures and measures in place to deal with cybersecurity challenges.  The lack of public disclosure also hinders investor ability to differentiate between those companies that are proactively developing, monitoring and managing cybersecurity risks versus those failing to prioritise these risks. The Commissions disclosure proposals would allow investors to better assess company policies and control, accountability and board oversight related to cybersecurity.  Policies and procedures We welcome the proposal requiring registrants to disclose their policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and threats. We are particularly supportive of the requirement to disclose the coverage of issuers policies and procedures regarding third parties. We encourage the SEC to clarify that disclosure of policies and procedures should include disclosure of the extent that policies cover global operations, not just those in the US. PRIs research demonstrated that while companies generally perceived cybersecurity as a key organisational risk, very few communicated that they have policies, governance structures and processes that were effective at tackling cyber threats.6 The research also showed that even when the policies were published by the company, most companies did not include the extent of the coverage for global operations and third parties. Comprehensive disclosure of cybersecurity policies is particularly valuable as associates in the value chain, including suppliers and vendors, are often viewed as weak links when it comes to cybersecurity; they hold or have access to sensitive data but may not have appropriate policies and processes in place.  5 Principles for Responsible Investment, Engaging on cybersecurity: results of the PRI collaborative engagement 2017 2019 (2020), available at https://www.unpri.org/cyber security/engaging on cyber security results of the pri collaborative engagement 2017 2019/5680.article.  6 Principles for Responsible Investment (2018), Stepping up governance on cybersecurity: what is corporate disclosure telling investors? (2018), available at https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5134. 5 The PRI engagement dialogues demonstrated a need for investors to establish systematic policies and processes addressing cybersecurity risks.7 The proposed disclosure would support investors in managing cybersecurity risk as disclosure can show companies readiness to address potential threats and the robustness of the steps being taken to manage cyber risks.  Governance and board oversight The PRI welcomes the proposal requiring disclosure of a registrants cybersecurity governance, including the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk.  Investors increasingly expect cybersecurity issues to fall within the remit of company boards and their sub committees given the potential physical and economic implications of a cybersecurity incident on business operations.8 The extent of board buy in on cybersecurity can be a good litmus test for the effectiveness of a companys approach to cyber risk. Although companies may adopt different models, depending on what is most appropriate for their business and in line with existing governance structures, it is important that they communicate where ultimate responsibility for cyber issues sits within the company. Boards have a role in ensuring that cybersecurity considerations are not just integrated into risk management, but that they also drive strategy and shape broader business decision making.9 In order to enable this, board members should receive quality management information and be well informed so that they can sense check the adequacy of cybersecurity programs, and challenge management actions where appropriate.  The PRIs research revealed that companies often did not disclose details of which cybersecurity information is reported to the board and how this information is evaluated.10 Investors engaging with issuers found that this level of information was critical to develop a view around the robustness of decision making on cybersecurity issues within the firm. As such, the Commissions proposed requirement disclosures would support investor efforts on this topic.  Management role The PRI also welcomes the Commissions proposal requiring disclosure of managements role and relevant expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks and implementing related policies, procedures and strategies. As the number of cybersecurity incidents continues to rise, and take new forms, it is vital that companies have robust governance measures in place to manage and address risks. Having a person or committee directly accountable for cybersecurity risk is a key first step. Having a senior executive responsible for cybersecurity signals to investors that there is internal expertise to appropriately allocate investments, staff time and resources. Senior management is best placed to  7 Principles for Responsible Investment, Engaging on cybersecurity: results of the PRI collaborative engagement 2017 2019 (2020), available at https://www.unpri.org/cyber security/engaging on cyber security results of the pri collaborative engagement 2017 2019/5680.article. 8 Ibid. 9 Marsh, Governing Cyber Risk: A Guide for Company Boards (April 2018), available at https://www.marsh.com/content/dam/marsh/Documents/PDF/UK en/governing cyber risk report.pdf.  10 Principles for Responsible Investment (2018), Stepping up governance on cybersecurity: what is corporate disclosure telling investors? (2018), available at https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5134. 6 manage cybersecurity on a day to day basis and keep the board aware of cybersecurity and related risk management.11 The PRIs research revealed that disclosure of management accountability for cybersecurity is lacking.12 As investors are not privy to internal management discussions around cyber readiness or incident management, they rely on company boards and management for their oversight, governance and disclosure of this enterprise risk. The PRI supports the proposal, as the required disclosure would encourage companies to better articulate where responsibility for cybersecurity lies within the business.  DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE The PRI welcomes mandatory disclosure of board expertise on cybersecurity. In general, the PRI believes that enhanced expertise at the board level on sustainability matters is crucial to companies sustainability efforts. Board cybersecurity expertise serves as a useful starting point for investors to assess a companys approach to cybersecurity, which is one part of sustainable operations.  However, the existence of a cybersecurity expert on the board should not be used as a proxy for efficient cybersecurity risk management. Alternative approaches to addressing cyber expertise at the board level can be an important aspect of a companys risk management strategy. For instance, PRI research showed that companies have nuanced positions on board expertise on cybersecurity. 13 Many companies take alternative approaches to address deficits in knowledge and expertise on the board and ensure that board members are able to ask the right questions and challenge senior management on cybersecurity. Examples to upskill their boards on cybersecurity include training, support of external advisors and specialist consultants. Moreover, PRIs engagement dialogues revealed that companies were looking for a spectrum of relevant experience, and while cyber and IT skills are included in the mix, they could not be considered in isolation but in the context of existing and desired board composition. Therefore, we recommend that the disclosure requirement should be broadened to require disclosure on how board expertise on cybersecurity is addressed. With this change, issuers could report other ways cybersecurity expertise is addressed.  ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Training on cybersecurity The PRI recommends the Commission require disclosure of the extent of management and staff training on cybersecurity.  11 Council of Institutional Investors, Prioritizing Cybersecurity: Five Investor Questions for Portfolio Company Boards (2016), available at https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/05/20/prioritizing cybersecurity five questions for portfolio company boards/. 12 Principles for Responsible Investment, Engaging on cybersecurity: results of the PRI collaborative engagement 2017 2019 (2020), available at https://www.unpri.org/cyber security/engaging on cyber security results of the pri collaborative engagement 2017 2019/5680.article. 13 Principles for Responsible Investment, Engaging on cybersecurity: results of the PRI collaborative engagement 2017 2019 (2020), available at https://www.unpri.org/cyber security/engaging on cyber security results of the pri collaborative engagement 2017 2019/5680.article.  7 Staff training is an important element of risk management, the majority of data breaches within organisations are the result of human actors, and preventative measures and infrastructure enhancements can only go so far if they are not properly integrated and utilized across the organization.14  In fact, the PRI engagement revealed that although several companies implemented risk management training for all employees, they failed to disclose information on training on cybersecurity and data protection.15 Cybersecurity processes and procedures should be embedded throughout the organisation and expanded through education and training for all staff. Details on training and education efforts should be properly disclosed, because providing regular training to all staff on cyber threats, handling sensitive information, IT policies and procedures is essential for effective governance of cybersecurity. The PRI has experience of public policy on sustainable finance policies and responsible investment across multiple markets and stands ready to further support the work of the Commission on cybersecurity disclosure requirements.

150,Ross Young,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-280362.htm,"The proposed rule for CyberSecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure is a fair attempt to increase cyber security but lacks prescriptive guidance to actually improve cyber security.  On page 11 of the PDF you mention that investors have been seeking registrants cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance practices. Yet the actions requested on page 12 (provide updates on incidents, policies/procedures, boards oversight) are too high level to actually inform investors of the real vulnerabilities that companies possess.  Willis Towers Watson Study analyzed 1150+ cyber claims to insurance companies and identified the average claim settlement to be 4.88 million dollars. This is a financially significant loss that most companies would have to declare in their financial statements. When they analyzed the root causes they found were:  1) 29% of Data Breaches are caused by Human Error (example humans falling for Phishing Attacks) 2) 24% of Data Breaches are caused by Security Breach at vendor or third party (Outsourced Contractor loses company data) 3) 10% of Data Breaches are caused by IT Security measures (Example Vulnerable Internet Facing Server)  If we were to look at 10 K reporting required by the SEC, we can see that companies do not report on how vulnerable they are to phishing, 3rd party risks, or IT Security measures in a way that allows investors to actually make investment decisions. Companies only list Risk Factors that are so vague that investors cannot make investment decisions on how vulnerable a company truly is. Example of what SEC risk reporting in a sample 10 K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312513416534/d590790d10k.htm) ************************ There may be breaches of the Companys information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. The Companys business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information (PII). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages. The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. The Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Companys products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. ***************************** If we compare this standard to what is done in the liability section of a financial statement where investors can identify debt, accounts payable, and other liabilities we can see much more transparency. This comment to S7 09022 therefore recommends the SEC amend the 10 K reporting to require disclosure of cyber metrics which are leading indicators of future data breaches:  Examples of metrics could include but are not limited to the following examples:  During the Q4 Phishing Exercise conducted by your company what % of employees clicked the phishing link/attachment. What % of your employees reported the phishing attack to your cyber incident response team What is your patching standard to patch critical vulnerabilities (CVSS score >9) and high vulnerabilities (CVSS score 7 9)? Is it 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, .? How many internet facing servers do you have that currently have a high/critical vulnerability that is outside of your patching policy? What % of your total population of internet facing servers is it? What is your average Mean Time To Remediate Internet Facing servers How many third parties did your company send PII data to over the last year? Of these companies, how many have a Non Disclosure Agreement Of these companies, how many provided your company with a SOC2 Type 2 Report or ISO 27001 certification to show their company was reviewed to safeguard and apply sound cyber practices? Of these companies, how many provided your company with a recent penetration test (< 1 year old) to show you services hosting your PII data would be protected What % of Financially Significant Applications have daily backups that are read only (ie developers do not have the ability to change or modify and thus can survive a ransomware attack)? What % of endpoints in your organization are running an up to date AntiVirus agent (signatures that are < 30 days old.) What % of employees are required to use MFA to log into corporate email? What % of Internet facing RDP/SSH servers require MFA? Similar to SOX reform after Enron, The disclosure of leading indicators of future data losses brings transparency to an industry. Thus if an investor believes one company is more likely to suffer a breach they could invest in a competitor. However, at this point in time investors are unable to make financially relevant decisions into how well a company can protect itself from phishing, 3rd party data loss, or website attacks. Till this transparency is required by the SEC, companies will hide how vulnerable their organization remains to cyber attacks and data breaches. Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above recommendations. Thank you,  Ross Young",1
151,John Smith,https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-280186.htm,"Dear Sir/Madam, Having worked within the Operation Technology industry for over 30 years, I found your proposal to modify SEC reporting requirements very interesting. I work as a freelance OT security consultant for many major clients and have added the comments below for consideration. One of the most common traits I come across, is that businesses do not necessarily have the in house expertise to understand their business well enough to convey the types of information being proposed. Indeed, CISOs (with an IT Background) typically do not have the necessary understanding of automated production/manufacturing environments. This compounds the issue in that most boards of Directors may not adequately understand cyber risks to their CPS (Cyber Physical Systems). From an institutional investors perspective, this will increasingly carry greater risk.  The comments below are only a small sample of points you may find pertinent and I would be more than happy to continue the conversation as a ‘contributing member to the draft SEC requirement. I have included a LinkedIn profile link to highlight my background within this area as a point of reference.  LinkedIn Link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john smith 2b8b1741  I hope you find the comments below of use. These are all my own personal comments in how I personally would like to see risk conveyed, specifically those which relate to Operational Technology: All entities should provide a report on their OT real estate in the form of a risk based score following a cyber security risk assessment which relates to the environment e.g. NIST 800 82, IEC 62443 or NERC CIP. The nature of the business and the operators environment should be a consideration when disclosing cyber posture. I.e. OT cyber security should be measured in context to the operations and environment. This will convey a ‘true understanding of the current cyber posture and indicate to the investor, where a particular business is weak or strong against threats posed by that, such as an institutional or nation state threat actor. The SEC should mandate the use of a particular security framework according to the industry e.g. NERC CIP, or develop a high level framework  see comments below at point 8. The SEC should mandate a periodic OT cyber audit against the original cyber assessment. This is to provide a report that the business is meeting its current cyber posture, leveraging new technologies and mitigating current and future cyber risks. Form 8 K should stipulate the type and location of where a business should monitor and provide cyber posture related information i.e. the business entity should be capable of conveying cyber status across its entire business. In the case of Operational Technology, this should be the full OT environment including Industrial Control Systems down to sensor level, not just connectivity in to the OT domain. This is of particular importance given that most organisations are protecting entry in to their systems, but are not adequately realising the full ‘attack vectors which can be exploited. E.g. 3rd party supply chains or inside threats (there are many attack scenarios possible). In order to provide a report within 4 days, the business needs to display evidence that they understand their business from an attack perspective. I.e. Businesses should be made not only to have a security assessment, but should also be asked to assess and understand their respective environment  different businesses, geolocations and installations have different attack vectors/motives and as such, an ICS and Enterprise IT attack scenario should be part of the investigation. All security requirements should mandate that an external entity should conduct the assessment from an impartial, independent position. There needs to be independent consistency for the SEC and industry self governance will not provide this. The assessment should not only consider cyber security from an information security perspective, but in relation to OT, should consider security from several lenses, such as Engineering, personnel & process safety and asset hardening etc. OT has significant security requirements which revolve around ‘cyber physical systems, not information security. It may be the case that the SEC should define and adopt a high level CAF (Cyber Assessment Framework). This should include indicators of good practice, such as good at detecting and incident, but poor at protecting against. If using a mature security framework, forms 10 Q and 10 K should be modified to show what the risk score was at the time of the incident and what it is after additional security mitigations have been made. This is to show the potential investor how much progress has been made in the form of a metric. E.g. ‘We have introduced technology and/or procedure ‘X to mitigate against the previous incident. This has increased our PROTECT rating from 24% to 72% or we have moved from NIST 2 to NIST 4 (on a scale of 1 5). Form 107 should be amended to show that not only does the board hold a member which has cyber security expertise, but that the member has expertise relevant to the particular industry. E.g. If it is a chemical plant, the cyber board member may be a CISO from an IT background, but has no experience or expertise in relation to the cyber security of safety instrumented systems. This is extremely important given that process expertise is essential in understanding cyber risks. The manufacturing process may contain valuable IP, but may also be explosive, hazardous or radioactive for example. Most boards utilise a CISO for all cyber security. In relation to any business which holds a process plant or manufacturing division, there is a strong argument to suggest the CISO is not best placed and that the board cyber representative for Operational Technology, should be from an Engineering background with security expertise. I have seen numerous occasions where the CISO is relied upon and utilises ‘high level cyber assessment frameworks. This not only leads to a false sense of security from the business perspective, but also could convey the wrong security posture to the institutional investor. In addition, the use of an IT security driven approach within OT environments, leads to a business utilising COTS (Common Off The Shelf) IT biased products to secure OT. Something they were not designed for, robust enough for and they ultimately, may only provide limited protection to the ‘Crown Jewels of the business. In terms of section B and form 8 K, because most OT secure assessments have not fully considered the domain right down to ICS (Industrial Control System) level, there is growing concern that OT related incidents are not discovered and subsequently reported. This then can lead (form the investors perspective), to a scenario where by the investor has committed significant capital and in turn, could lose the advantage offered by product superiority through loss of IP confidentiality. This then begs the question, is the business capable of detecting ‘all forms of incident based on varying attack vectors and to all parts of the business? All the above and much more, will help to form the basis and determine, how/if an organisation is capable of detecting and reporting the required information in an XBRL standardised format Kind regards,  John Smith.",1

It must be made clear to the SEC that disclosing the actual policies and procedures of an organization is misguided, since it would divulge Intellectual Property (IP) and enable the weaponization of the content by nefarious parties. The final rule must focus on disclosing pertinent information about an organizations cybersecurity policies and standards, while not disclosing the actual content of the policies and procedures. For example, The registrant has a cybersecurity risk assessment program and if so, provide a description of such program from within the proposed rule is wording that meets the intent of disclosing information about the cybersecurity policies and standards, without divulging IP or information that could be used to attack and bypass the cybersecurity defenses of the organization. Many organizations within scope of this SEC rule have used third parties to help craft cybersecurity policies and procedures, where those organizations are contractually obligated to protect the IP associated with the documentation. Therefore, an SEC rule that requires the public disclosure of complete cybersecurity policies and standards would compel organizations into violating legally binding contracts for non disclosure. Do not weaken the security or expose organizations to enhanced liability from forcing the disclosure an organizations policies and procedures.",1

Miller, Miller Cyber Security Consulting Services LLC",https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-09-22/s70922-20121204-273364.pdf,"23 March 2022 Clarence Miller Owner  Miller Cyber Security Consulting Services LLC Hello,  My comment is regarding S7 09 22 Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance (RSG), and Incident Disclosure. This seems to be an extension of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) monitor step of security and privacy posture of systems and organization. Although NIST RMF is not a mandatory requirement for public trading companies to comply with, NISTs built in RMF monitoring procedures would seem the more logical approach to ensure disclosure of a companys true security posture and if incidents have or will occur based on the findings from ongoing monitoring.  Ongoing monitoring is the key to Risk Management, Strategy and Governance. In my humble opinion, there can be an extensive number of rules and regulations to require public trading companies to comply with. However, the critical piece to that compliance is through a form of ongoing monitoring, which means companies should have third party assessors/auditors checking them on a bi annual or annual bases, whichever is the more stringent for monitoring for a particular company. To ensure that the companies risk management policies and procedures, Strategic principles and overall Governance are being followed and adhere to. Most companies are already doing this albeit most have tied this to their capital expenses. Since any new asset or add value to an existing asset is coupled with strategic value and risk management.  Would seem prudent to ensure any added risk is infused with the ability of the company to deduct those expenses through operational or tax purposes, as security and the reduction of risk to ones assets has a placed value, it should be part of your daily operating expense (e.g., remediation through operational expenses or insurance against the risk).  Having a company report on their Risk Management, Strategy and Governance through procedures both IS0 27001 and NIST SP 800 137 would allow for the granularity of seeing what risk is being overlook by the company and all disclosures that require reporting.  The key is identifying potential risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) metrics in cyber and risk management. This can predicate if a company is trending in a particular trend would expose their risk.  Defining the particulars in what, when and how continuous monitoring should be conducted is the key. If its left up to the individual companies, you will get different aspects of reporting of disclosure, based on what that company deems as important risk. For example, a whaling attack on high profile employees email, should this be report,  yes through the continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities of risk to a corporates email server and services how many and how often should be a metric collect and reported on through KRI. An assessor/auditor would have this data as part of their RSG collected/correlated security data. Allowing for a comprehensive report too corporate board on the companys risk and compliance status.  Since this is ongoing, this would help the company trend its progress over a given timeframe. This would also help the SEC in trending the potential incident of disclosure by looking back over time to see were the vulnerability/risk was overlooked that caused the disclosure.  In summation, yes, I agree this rule is needed, however, we should also add the benefit of outlining procedures to accomplish this rule which would help tremendously and not allow for disparage reporting. What I propose isnt new, just building on what sourced procedures already existing (e.g. ISO and NIST reporting) and utilizing it to better a companys reporting of Cyber Risk Management, Strategic and Governance.

Most organizations would or should consider the details of their security environment, policies, and strategies to be sensitive and proprietary information. Requiring organizations to report this type of information removes a level of protection by exposing information regarding the specific plans, policies and strategies at use within the organization.",1

Countryman) Proposed Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure Rule Making Objectives in a Rapidly Evolving Area: While all of the proposed measures appearing in the above referenced rules are advisable  and as someone who has worked in the information security and privacy field for 40+ years, Im sure they will make a contribution  I am nonetheless concerned about the trajectory of the SECs rule making process. To add progressively more and more specific rules, puts the SEC in the position of the detailed rule maker of the specific information security and privacy control measures that must be used at public companies. This has not been the traditional role of the SEC, nor do I believe that the agency currently has the resources to support this role on an on going basis. Furthermore, this puts the SEC in the position of being in competition with other organizations that do specifically define such control measures. This definition of the specific requirements for control measures is best left to organizations already doing such work, such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). Instead, I suggest that the SEC could get considerably more leverage, and make a much greater difference with investors, the public at large, and the companies it supervises, if it were to change the corporate decision making incentive systems that apply to information security and privacy. Furthermore, information security and privacy control measures change very rapidly, and if the SEC continues down this path of increasing specificity in the information security and privacy control measures that it requires of publicly listed companies, it will be obligated to keep abreast of these rapid fire changes in the field, and then it must attempt to get the very slow SEC rule making process to keep up with these rapid fire changes in the field. For a more detailed discussion about why this increasingly specific rule making approach is not advisable, and is in fact in conflict with the approach taken by a variety of other organizations, I refer the reader to an article that I co authored entitled: A Simple Appeal to Common Sense: Why the Current Legal & Regulatory Regime for Information Security & Privacy Doesnt Work, and Cannot Be Made to Work (appearing in the December 2017 issue of ISSA Journal). Achieving More Leverage by Changing Incentive Systems: The SEC has made a tremendous difference with two general decision making related rules it has issued: (1) those pertaining to third party financial auditor opinions about financial statements, and (2) those pertaining to top management sign off on the internal controls used to prepare financial statements. These rules are, of course, a direct result of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These two areas of general rulemaking have placed top management at publicly listed companies in a position where they must clear a major action hurdle (specifically obtain an independent audit opinion, and sign off on the internal controls) in order to be able to issue financial statements, as is required for continued listing of their companys stock on public exchanges. These two areas of general rulemaking have changed the ways that top management at public companies make decisions about, design, document, audit, and report about control measures, and the net result has been a tremendous increase in accounting system transparency, publicly released data integrity, and the related reduction in fraud. These two general rules have changed corporate incentive systems for publicly listed companies, and something comparable should be done in the area of information security and privacy, to properly incentivize top management (and the board too) to pay sufficient attention to, and devote adequate resources to, information security and privacy matters. For example, the SEC could require that all publicly listed companies, annually obtain the professional opinion of an independent attorney, expressing his/her opinion about whether the directors and officers have been performing their existing fiduciary duties in a manner that meets the minimum requirements defined by laws and regulations in the information security and privacy area. The related required control measures have already been defined by laws and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), court decisions such as In re Caremark Intl Deriv. Litig, 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996), and agency regulations such as the Federal Trade Commissions Red Flags Rule (for identity theft). While of course the relevant information security and privacy requirements, to which the directors and officers must comply, will vary by industry and jurisdiction (such as according to state law), the set of requirements to which the directors and officers can now be held to account can readily be defined and audited against for every publicly listed company. For the SEC to adopt a rule which changes decision making incentive systems in the domain of information security and privacy, the way it did with the requirement for all annual reports to be audited by an independent financial audit, that would make a very big contribution, and it would also free the SEC of the need to keep defining/updating specific control measure rules year after year as this field continues to evolve rapidly (as discussed above). For considerably more information about changing incentive systems in this area, I refer the reader to a law review article I wrote entitled Solving the Information Security & Privacy Crisis by Expanding the Scope of Top Management Personal Liability (appearing in the December 2016 issue of the Journal of Legislation).

Chairman Gensler has also expressed publicly that payment for order flow (PFOF) is a clear conflict of interest. Practices such as ex dividend plays border on insider trading and are the closest modern day analogue to this anecdote. As such, with cyber exploits being as rampant as they are, it is difficult at times for the average citizen or consumer to place much credence in anything a public or private institution, agency, or company has to say. The very nature by which we define our world and ourselves in it seems to have itself become the hack. We must return to the great ideals upon which this nation was founded. When President Biden said that we are in a battle for the very soul of this nation, that was not hyperbole. Failure to act in a meaningful way will be quite damning for all of us, perhaps in the most literal way. Accordingly, current practices and methodologies would seem to infringe on the freedom of the American people to worship as they see fit.

There should be severe consequences for a company for merely under allocating resources to cybersecurity. We should also not solely rely on them as the arbiters of truth with regards to validity of cybersecurity concerns. And we should not wait until it is too late to do anything about it to find out.  It is the responsibility of the government of, by and for the People to ensure our safety in cyberspace. Further, the government needs to do more to adapt to emerging threats. Major ones that come to mind at the moment include the epidemic of spam/scam calls and texts that Americans have been receiving and suspicious actors on social media.

We appreciate the opportunity to provide observations from our role in the capital markets (e.g , current practices, company readiness, and drivers of decision useful disclosure) that may be helpful to the Commission as it considers the next steps for the proposed as well as to suggest certain areas where we believe that clarification could assist issuers in providing consistent and comparable information to investors: OBSERVATIONS FROM Our PARTicipATiOn In ThE CAPITAL MARKETS While executives, boards, and audit committee members generally acknowledge the increasing importance of cybersecurity matters, in our work with companies within the capital markets, we have observed a wide variation in where companies are on the journey to integrate cybersecurity considerations into their enterprise risk management system, strategy, and core business activities. We have also seen significant variation in what each company measures and reports. Many issuers have a robust infrastructure to identify, define, measure, and communicate cybersecurity matters while certain other issuers may still be developing and implementing cybersecurity infrastructure into core business functions. As the Commission moves forward in addressing cybersecurity matters in its disclosure regime; it will be important to consider these variations among companies, and how they may affect the ability to elicit useful, reliable, and comparable cybersecurity disclosure across all SEC reporting companies: Our observations about the variation in company practice on cybersecurity reporting matters include the following: May key  rule, 2 1. Issuers face challenges in assessing cybersecurity incidents at third party service providers (TPSPs): Issuers will have to rely on TPSPs to provide timely and complete information on cybersecurity incidents to meet their disclosure requirements under the proposed rule. This will require that the TPSPs also have a robust infrastructure to identify, define, measure, and communicate cybersecurity matters: The responsibility for identifying notifying, and remediating cybersecurity matters at the third party may rest with the TPSP if this is specified in the contractual arrangement with that TPSP . However, there is a risk, not completely within an issuer $ control, that the TPSP (1) may not notify a issuer of an incident, (2) may not communicate timely, or (3) may not provide sufficient details on the incident to allow the issuer to evaluate the risk and/or materiality of the incident or the related remediation process. Further, many TPSPs involve other subservice organizations in the delivery of their services. This adds another layer between the issuer and the service organization in terms of obtaining information on an incident: Certain TPSPs and subservice organizations may be receiving Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports, which include an independent attestation covering the controls over issuers data at such TPSPs. However, not all companies receive such reports, and there are limitations regarding their use. For example: SOC 1 reports focus on internal controls over financial reporting and therefore would not provide a complete picture of controls over relevant information given the breadth of the cybersecurity disclosures: SOC 2 reports focus on operational objectives and have specific requirements that cover the Trust Services Criteria (including up to five categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and/or privacy) and therefore may need to be enhanced to include controls over these specific disclosures: Both SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports are typically issued annually, which may not be timely enough for issuers. It may also be difficult for an issuer to use the information in a SOC report to evaluate immaterial incidents in the aggregate because SOC reports are presented from the TPSP $ perspective and are the same whether issued to a multi billion dollar large accelerated filer or smaller reporting company: Given the challenges inherently involved in obtaining timely and decision useful information from TPSPs, we would suggest that the Commission consider whether providing issuers additional transition time to comply with the requirements to disclose incidents at TPSPs would allow issuers to enhance the reporting infrastructure with TPSPs through updated contractual provisions or other appropriate means. See the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy, available at https [Lus aicpa org/content/dam/aicpalinterestareaslfrclassuranceadvisoryservices[downloadabledocuments/trust services_ criteria paf 3 2. Issuers may not currently have cyber incident tracking systems designed to support the aggregation of all immaterial incidents: As noted above, we have observed varying degrees of sophistication of cybersecurity programs and protocols. While many issuers have a robust infrastructure to identify and communicate cybersecurity matters, certain, less mature issuers may still be developing and incorporating cybersecurity infrastructure into core business functions. Even issuers with mature systems may not have currently designed them to retain details about immaterial cyber incidents. If the final rule retains the requirement to aggregate immaterial incidents and report them when become material in the aggregate, issuers may need additional time to implement system functionality to support this requirement: Further, issuers may also require further guidance on how to perform this aggregation (e.g,, the period over which the information related to immaterial incidents must be retained and assessed): Refer to our observations in Additional Clarity to Drive Consistent; Comparable, and Reliable Disclosure below. 3. Cybersecurity has been an area of increasing focus for boards and there are a variety of ways boards exercise their oversight of this area: We have observed that oversight of cybersecurity is an increasing area of focus for boards and agree with the Commission that such oversight is a critical aspect of governance. For example, a January 2022 survey of 246 audit committee members conducted by Deloitte and the Center for Audit Quality showed that of those overseeing cybersecurity, two thirds expected to spend more time on the topic in the coming year:? We have also observed that there are a variety of board oversight structures, the most effective of which are tailored to the needs of the company (e g , taking into account industry, company structure, company maturity). For example, in the Deloitte/CAQ audit committee survey, approximately half of the respondents reported that the audit committee is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity: In other companies, we have observed that board oversight of cybersecurity may rest with the full board or with another committee (e.g , 3 risk or technology committee): We agree with the Commission that board understanding of critical oversight topics is important, including making sure that the CEO hires an experienced C suite that understands the board$ role and how to inform and discuss strategic topics with the board: A board must be informed and knowledgeable enough to advise and challenge management in all areas of its oversight: Boards themselves acknowledged this need;? and many use a matrix to define and identify the skills, experiences, and diversity needed to execute their duties effectively: We have observed that upon identifying needed skills, boards can such skills in numerous ways, including by recruiting members with specific experience or by educating existing board members individually or collectively. We note that in addition to proposing required disclosure about whether any member of a company $ board has cybersecurity expertise, the Commission recently proposed similar See Deloitte $ and the Center for Audit Quality $ jointly published Common Threads Across Audit Committees: https [Lwww2 deloitte comlus/en/pages/center for board effectiveness/articles/audit committee practices: report htmlid us: Zem: 3na acb awa boardef 020222 mkid K0148184&ctraircta2 &sfid 0033000000QOgmZAAL: In the Deloitte/CAQ survey; 41 percent of respondents indicated that the audit committee needed more cyber expertise (more than in any other risk area): cyber they gain disclosure related to board expertise in climate related risks. We believe dedicated expertise may be valuable for some companies. In general, however, especially given the limited size of boards,5 it may not be practical or advisable for a board to recruit dedicated experts in each of its critical oversight areas. While we recognize that neither of the proposals requires designated board experts, we believe that, especially when read together, some may infer that the Commission prefers that issuers identify such experts We therefore encourage the Commission to consider whether existing proxy rules (which require disclosure of the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills of board nominees), when combined with disclosure regarding board oversight of a company $ cybersecurity risk, may be sufficient to inform investors about the role of the board in cyber risk management; without a separate requirement to identify cybersecurity experts: ADDITIONAL CLARiTY To Drive CONSISTEnt, COMPARABLE, AND RELIABLE DIScLOSURE The quality, transparency, relevance, and comparability of cybersecurity disclosures can be enhanced by the application of established standards and frameworks: We have identified several elements of the proposed rule that may benefit from additional clarity and thus help the Commission achieve its goal of eliciting consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure_ Terminology Definitions We propose that the Commission consider clarifying certain terminology within the proposed rule, including information in the definition of cyber incidents and potential occurrence in the definition of cybersecurity threats. As written, the term any implies considering each and every instance in which either an incident or threat may exist. This broad definition may be applied inconsistently among issuers: While issuers may need to establish a framework to exercise judgment in evaluating incidents, further guidance regarding whether a de minimis concept could apply may assist issuers in focusing on cybersecurity incidents or threats that are more relevant to the organization$ purpose and strategy, thereby providing more decision useful information to investors. The Commission may consider whether there should be tiers of important information and describe the impact on the issuer $ evaluation for each tier level. For example; the issuer could apply a risk assessment approach that distinguishes between crown jewel information such as strategic intellectual property and personally identifiable information (PII) from lower risk information such as informational data or non PII internal records that can be reproduced. Clarifying the types of information that would be evaluated within the definition of a threat or incident may assist an issuer in focusing disclosure on the information most useful for investors. We have also considered the intersection of this release and the release Cybersecurity Risk Management for Investment Advisers, Registered Investment Companies, and Business Development Companies (Release No. 33 11028) and would like to highlight that there are certain additional terms defined in Release No. 33 11028 that were not defined in the proposed rule: Thus, we would suggest that the Commission consider whether the defined terms should be consistent For example, Release No_ 33 See The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors (SEC Release No. 34 94478; File No. S7  10 22, available at: https LLWWW secgovIrules/proposed/2022/33 11042 pdf)_ According to the 2021 U.S. Spencer Stuart Board Index (available at https LLWWW spencerstuart comL Lmedia/2021/october/ssbi202A/us spencer stuart board index 2021pdf) s&P 500 boards range in size from 5 to 22 members, and average 10.8 directors; 71 percent of boards fall into in the 9 to 12 member range_ any any easily 5 11028 includes definitions of adviser information; cybersecurity risk; and cybersecurity vulnerability; but these terms or their equivalents are not defined in this proposed rule: Appropriate SEC Form for Disclosure It is not unusual for the investigation into a material incident to take months and for facts to develop or become known over the period of investigation. Footnote 69 of the proposed rule states: Notwithstanding proposed Item 106(dJ(1), there may be situations where a registrant would need to file an amended Form 8 K to correct disclosure from the initial Item 1.05 Form 8 K, such as where that disclosure becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments regarding the incident: For example, if the impact of the incident is determined after the initial Item 1.05 Form 8 K to be significantly more severe than previously disclosed, an amended Form 8 K may be required: We suggest the Commission consider clarifying when material changes, additions, or updates in a cybersecurity incident should be updated via Form 8 K as opposed to a periodic filing: This could include clarifying whether a Form 8 K amendment, rather than an update in a periodic would be required when a material increase in scope and/or severity is uncovered as an investigation into an incident progresses. For example, assume a cybersecurity incident is identified as materially impacting an issuer $ systems in one country and that incident was disclosed in Form 8 K Subsequently, the issuer determines that multiple countries are materially impacted: Is an issuer required to report such development in Form 8 K to correct disclosure that becomes inaccurate or materially misleading as a result of subsequent developments or is such a development considered an update to the previously disclosed information? Framework for Aggregating Immaterial Cybersecurity Incidents We suggest the Commission consider establishing a framework for aggregating a series of previously undisclosed individually immaterial cybersecurity incidents to determine when they may become material in the aggregate. A framework for aggregation may assist in ensuring comparability and consistency across issuers and enhance the usefulness of such information for investors: More specifically, the Commission may consider addressing the following questions within an aggregation framework: Would aggregation restart each annual period or begin on some other date such as inception of the company, from an initial registration statement, or some other defined period? Further, would there be a cutoff date or period specified? Should immaterial incidents be categorized by some defining characteristic when assessing aggregation (e.g , type of incident; system impacted, method of attack)? Should remediated, immaterial incidents be removed from the aggregation analysis? If when? How should such disclosure be maintained in a periodic report once it has been included? How would subsequent immaterial incidents be evaluated once disclosure of such incidents in the aggregate is presented? In evaluating these points, the SEC may consider the application of other SEC rules that provide a framework for disclosure requirements when events aggregate to a defined level, such as that in Regulation S X Article 3 05, Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired or to Be Acquired, which requires assessment of individually insignificant acquisitions for an issuer $ fiscal year typically up to the filing filing; SO, long 6 of its next 10 K Further, the SEC may also consider providing examples of how the framework is applied, if aggregating immaterial incidents with different defining characteristics is required (i.e , a phishing incident and malware attack) so that issuers may apply the framework consistently, common parameters: Transition Provisions and Scalability As highlighted above, the level and sophistication of cybersecurity reporting structures varies by issuer, and, if the proposed rule were finalized as written, many issuers may need to invest further in their cyber tracking and disclosure systems to meet certain new disclosure requirements. We have observed that larger issuers may currently have systems in place to track some of this information for disclosure more readily, while smaller issuers may require significant investment to implement systems that perform the detailed tracking and evaluation necessary for some disclosures, such as aggregation: Further, issuers that are more prepared to identify and investigate incidents may disclose incidents earlier than those that are less prepared, which may skew information available to investors and cause them to potentially view as more favorable an issuer that has not disclosed a cyber incident because it lacks the resources to identify it: Therefore, we suggest the Commission consider outreach to issuers on the need for extended transition provisions or a phased implementation process by registrant tier to give issuers more time to prepare to provide certain disclosures and, ultimately, produce more consistent, decision useful disclosures. Given the widespread impact that cybersecurity incidents can have, it becomes increasingly important for investors to seek disclosure about such matters to understand how companies are prepared for such disruptions. We commend the Commission for its timely focus on this area. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspectives on the proposed rule.
